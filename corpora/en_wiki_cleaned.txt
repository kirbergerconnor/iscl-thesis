anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is against all forms of authority and seeks to abolish the institutions it claims maintain unnecessary coercion and hierarchy typically including the state and capitalism
anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations
as a historically left wing movement this reading of anarchism is placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement
although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment
during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation
various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period
anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the paris commune the russian civil war and the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism
in the last decades of the th and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more growing in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements
anarchists employ diverse approaches which may be generally divided into revolutionary and evolutionary strategies there is significant overlap between the two
evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like but revolutionary tactics which have historically taken a violent turn aim to overthrow authority and the state
many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory critique and praxis
the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix an and the word arkhos
the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy
anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder
various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists
many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid th century
since the s and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states
some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free market philosophy only and free market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism
while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party and extreme cultural liberals who are primarily concerned with civil liberties
additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism
anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti authoritarian wing of the socialist movement
anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state oriented or from above
scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two
some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism and being both liberal and socialist but more so
many scholars reject anarcho capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles
while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently
major definitional elements include the will for a non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non coercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy
the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece
in china philosophical anarchism was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi
alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism
anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece
aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy
socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience
cynics dismissed human law and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature
stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state
in medieval europe there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements
these and other muslim movements later gave birth to religious anarchism
in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i
in basra religious sects preached against the state
in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies
renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of anti authoritarian secularism particularly in france
enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority and the revolutions of the s and all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism
during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enrags and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments
the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france
by the late s various anarchist schools of thought had become well defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from to
this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism
drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents
the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council
bakunins faction and proudhons followers opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress
anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in
bakunin predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers
in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st
imier international
under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism
anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs
by the turn of the th century anarchism had spread all over the world
it was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement
in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism
tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from east asian countries who moved to the japanese capital to study
in latin america argentina was a stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology
during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence known as propaganda of the deed
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts
even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the us including the immigration act of also called the anarchist exclusion act
illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period
despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement especially in the makhnovshchina however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government had stabilised including during the kronstadt rebellion
bolshevik repressions of anarchist organizations prompted a series of assassination attempts on the russian communist leadership
several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine before the bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too
with the anarchists being repressed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism
the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party
seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements
in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international
in the spanish civil war of anarchists and syndicalists once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists
a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war and particularly in the spanish revolution of
in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land
the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the may days as joseph stalin asserted soviet control of the republican government ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists
by the end of world war ii the anarchist movement had been severely weakened
the s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war
during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti nuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the s and the new left
it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti capitalist reformism
anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols
the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism
black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic
this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america
around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements
anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization the group of eight and the world economic forum
during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police
other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet
a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the seattle wto conference
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria
while having revolutionary aspirations many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays
instead they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation
scholar carissa honeywell takes the example of food not bombs group of collectives to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work direct action working together and in solidarity with those left behind
while doing so they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger ranging from de funding the arms industry to addressing monsanto seed saving policies and patents helping farmers and commodification of food and housing
honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans but non humans and the environment as well
honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity but are causal factors as well resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole
anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution
the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership
in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the post classical currents developed thereafter
beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy
anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy
anarchisms emphasis on anti capitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism
anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum
much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist libertarian and radical interpretations of left wing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories
as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely
one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mrmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time
belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists
despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of shared principles such as autonomy mutual aid anti authoritarianism and decentralisation
inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism
they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism
they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society
mutualism is an th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon
its aims include abolishing the state reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people
mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism
in what is property proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin
collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism
collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
anarcho communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production held by a federal network of voluntary associations with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need
anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international
it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late th century
anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers
the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers self management
individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants
early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau
through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation
anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left
interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation
as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest
anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches
the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents
contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence
its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory
various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement
while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently
gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarcho communists
anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government economic class systems autocratic religions patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism
anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed
the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions
this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy
anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends
a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other
evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two
anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century
anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches
during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency
not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed
assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful
anarchists also took part in revolutions
many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state
many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late s the early s and the s with some still occurring in the early s
their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions
anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial
anarcho pacifists advocate for non violence means to achieve their stateless nonviolent ends
other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism
this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible
emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil
anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist
they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism
anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism
those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media
in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards
both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies
members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included
overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors
they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico
militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening
anarchists commonly employ direct action
this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives
decision making is often handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism
contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations
in contrast with the big a anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term small a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre joseph proudhon to justify their opinions
those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize
the decision making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role
anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group
one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point
minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values
anarchists usually form small groups to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members
these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks
anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate
as in the past newspapers and journals are used and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message
anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals
anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free
the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance
anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces
during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal
as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action
acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds
adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity
as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common
its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory
the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism
anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines
phenomena such as civilisation technology and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others
objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism
anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies
instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite
authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people
another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption
anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society
specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary
robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate
bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be
john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely
beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ
as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy many anarchists address analyse and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles
sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing
sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men
a historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love
in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory relationship anarchy and queer anarchism
free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men
the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure
those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together
free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love
anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage and pro choice and had a similar agenda
anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another
during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well
by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents
with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a post structuralist critique of sexual normality
some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation
the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism
anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid
anarchist writers such as william godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges
in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church
ferrers approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance
ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students
the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested
nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world
christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free
in a similar token a
neill founded what became the summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion
anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation
ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism
late th century and contemporary anarchist writers intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society
contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality
while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions
judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american canadian network of schools the self managed learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain
the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others
in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement
in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk
anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life
other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends
in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris rob claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism
throughout the th century many prominent anarchists and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts
three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists
it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests
as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect
the th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism
in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community
the most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot self govern and so a state is necessary for human survival
philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that eace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government
another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self governing a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism
another criticism of anarchism is the belief that it is inherently unstable that an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state
thomas hobbes and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the peoples interests and keep order
philosopher robert nozick argued that a night watchman state or minarchy would emerge from anarchy through the process of an invisible hand in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies evolving into a minimal state
anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a state of nature would not just be in a state of war
anarcho primitivists in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization such as hierarchies monopolies and inequality outweigh the benefits
philosophy lecturer andrew g
fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world such as at protests but in the world of ethics as well
secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically
this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it
the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory
anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken
lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong
philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as a
john simmons moral principles and political obligations
law professor william a
edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious
edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate
in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion
one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority
joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success
raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction
anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment
anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively
classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering
friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticised anarchisms anti authoritarianism as inherently counter revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian
academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas
the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values
according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence
marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act
in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining
anarchist communities albedo is the fraction of sunlight that is diffusely reflected by a body
it is measured on a scale from to
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee received by a surface
the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface
these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time
while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
the temporal resolution may range from seconds to daily monthly or annual averages
unless given for a specific wavelength albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface
this spectrum includes visible light which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright
ice albedo feedback is a positive feedback climate process where a change in the area of ice caps glaciers and sea ice alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet
ice is very reflective therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water
ice albedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change
albedo is an important concept in climate science
any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss
as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance
these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo
earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about
if earth were frozen entirely the average temperature of the planet would drop below
if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about
in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost
in scientists reported that earth dimmed by over two decades as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques
this may have both been co caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming
however the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend
this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
human activities change the albedo of various areas around the globe
human impacts to the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the earths radiative energy balance even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites
urbanization generally decreases albedo which contributes to global warming
deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate urban heat island
an estimate in found that on a global scale an albedo increase of in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing gt of co emissions
intentionally enhancing the albedo of the earths surface along with its daytime thermal emittance has been proposed as a solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling
efforts toward widespread implementation of pdrcs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to high values so long as a thermal emittance of at least can be achieved
the tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in almera spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs
a study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface area temperature of the high albedo area although changes were localized
a follow up study found that co eq
emissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land transformation and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change
albedo is not directly dependent on the illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location
however albedo and illumination both vary by latitude
albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation
tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation
because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth
this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker and reflects less heat back into space
this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect
albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather
the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks increased by self reinforcing or positive feedbacks and reduced by balancing or negative feedbacks
the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water vapour feedback the ice albedo feedback and the net effect of clouds
when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results
a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling
in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback
however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight cause melting
when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating
snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow
over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack
in switzerland the citizens have been protecting their glaciers with large white tarpaulins to slow down the ice melt
these large white sheets are helping to reject the rays from the sun and defecting the heat
although that this method is very expensive it has shown to work by reducing snow and ice melt by
just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water
sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow
when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases
the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts
as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback
both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming
cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates
because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions
albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions
research showed impacts of over for vertically mounted systems but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts
spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains of over have been observed for c si cells installed above healthy vegetation
an analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications
forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis
for this reason the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation
in other words the climate change mitigation effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight
in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be significant enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration
the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts as strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds
scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
mid to high latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground thus contributing to warming
modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary mitigation benefit
in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to
variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy
the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative effect of albedo change and effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes were neutral or perhaps warming
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs
incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator
however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction
because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
note that white caps on waves look white because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities
fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies
aerosols have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance
the direct effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect is less certain
another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is w m with a range to w m
black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo
in astronomy the term albedo can be defined in several different ways depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved
the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of
another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of
many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds
the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect
although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies
two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the geometric albedo and the bond albedo
their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion
in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single scattering albedo
it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
it depends on properties of the material the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
formula where formula is the astronomical albedo formula is the diameter in kilometers and formula is the absolute magnitude
in planetary radar astronomy a microwave pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target and the echo from the target is measured
in most instances the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse and the opposite sense
the echo power is measured in terms of radar cross section formula formula or formula and is equal to the cross sectional area of a metallic sphere at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power
those components of the received echo that return from first surface reflections are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection
if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering
formula where the denominator is the effective cross sectional area of the target object with mean radius formula
a smooth metallic sphere would have formula
the values reported for the moon mercury mars venus and comet p jq are derived from the total radar albedo reported in those references
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria
a or a is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the latin alphabet used in the modern english alphabet and others worldwide
its name in english is a plural aes
it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives
the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
the lowercase version is often written in one of two forms the double storey and single storey
the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type
in english a is the indefinite article with the alternative form an
in english the name of the letter is the long a sound pronounced
its name in most other languages matches the letters pronunciation in open syllables
the earliest known ancestor of a is aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet where it represented a glottal stop as phoenician only used consonantal letters
in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter representing a glottal stop so they adapted sign to represent the vowel calling the letter by the similar name alpha
in the earliest greek inscriptions dating to the th century bc following the greek dark ages the letter rests upon its side
however in the later greek alphabet it generally resembles the modern capital form though many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to the italian peninsula and left the form of alpha unchanged
when the romans adopted the etruscan alphabet to write latin the resulting form used in the latin script would come to be used to write many other languages including english
during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a
first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other more permanent media
there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces
due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semi cursive minuscule
variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles
the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial
at the end of the roman empire several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe
among these were the semi cursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain
by the ninth century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press
this form was derived through a combining of prior forms
th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today
these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version
the italic form also called script a is often used in handwriting it consists of a circle with a vertical stroke on its right
in the hands of medieval irish and english writers this form gradually developed from a th century form resembling the greek letter tau
the roman form is found in most printed material and consists of a small loop with an arc over it
both derive from the majuscule form
in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown
many fonts then made the right leg vertical
in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form
graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker a and double decker a respectively
italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type
there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin such as in the international phonetic alphabet
the double sequence does not occur in native english words but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark
however occurs in many common digraphs all with their own sound or sounds particularly and
in most languages that use the latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or
an exception is saanich in which and the glyph stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel
the latin letters and have unicode encodings and
these are the same code points as were used in ascii and iso
there are also precomposed character encodings for and with diacritics for most of those listed above the remainder are produced using combining diacritics
variant forms of the letter have unique code points for specialist use the alphanumeric symbols set in mathematics and science latin alpha in linguistics and halfwidth and fullwidth forms for legacy cjk font compatibility
the cyrillic and greek homoglyphs of the latin have separate encodings and
alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the united states
it borders tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west
alabama is the th largest by area and the th most populous of the us states
alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state after the state bird
alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state
the state has diverse geography with the north dominated by the mountainous tennessee valley and the south by mobile bay a historically significant port
alabamas capital is montgomery and its largest city by population and area is huntsville
its oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists in as the capital of french louisiana
greater birmingham is alabamas largest metropolitan area and its economic center
politically as part of the deep south alabama is predominantly a conservative state and is known for its southern culture
within alabama american football particularly at the college level plays a major part of the states culture
originally home to many native tribes present day alabama was a spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the french acquired it in the early eighteenth century
the british won the territory in until losing it in the american revolutionary war
spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until
in december alabama was recognized as a state
during the antebellum period alabama was a major producer of cotton and widely used african american slave labor
in the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america with montgomery acting as its first capital and rejoined the union in
following the american civil war alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the states economy
similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws from the late th century up until the s
high profile events such as the selma to montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the s and s
during and after world war ii alabama grew as the states economy diversified with new industries
nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville would help alabamas economic growth in the mid to late th century by developing an aerospace industry
alabamas economy in the st century is based on automotive finance tourism manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology
the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people a muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river
in the alabama language the word for a person of alabama lineage is
the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in transliterations of the term
as early as the french called the tribe the with french maps identifying the river as
other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu and allibamou
the use of state names derived from native american languages is common in the us an estimated states have names of native american origin
sources disagree on the words meaning
some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw and
the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants
the state has numerous place names of native american origin
an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest
this notion was popularized in the s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek
experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation
indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization
trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period and continued until european contact
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ce with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama
this is the second largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in present day illinois which was the center of the culture
analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex
contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently
the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood
among the historical tribes of native american people living in present day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogean speaking alabama chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati
while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages
the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama during their exploration of north america in the th century
the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in
more than years later the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile in
the city was moved to the current site of mobile in
this area was claimed by the french from to as part of la louisiane
after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from to
after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain
the latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to us forces on april
thomas bassett a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile
he settled in the tombigbee district during the early s
the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county
what are now baldwin and mobile counties became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and finally part of the mississippi territory in
most of what is now the northern two thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period
it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards
following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia although heavily disputed
with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower one third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in
the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal
spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams ons treaty officially ceded it to the united states in
before mississippis admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory
the united states congress created the alabama territory on march
stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to
alabama was admitted as the nd state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention
from july to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution
huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county
cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to
the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation
part of the frontier in the s and s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded
the economy of the central black belt was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor
the area also drew many poor disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers
alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by
most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in
from to tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital
on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery
the first legislative session in the new capital met in december
a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia
the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in
this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day
it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine
by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color
on january alabama declared its secession from the union
after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america
the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery
alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war
although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky
the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails
this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army
alabamas slaves were freed by the th amendment in
alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in
from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state
alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s
turner and james t
following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton
during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights
legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation
organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans
besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league
reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence
they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools
the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools
railroad passenger cars were segregated in
the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor european americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test
the constitution required racial segregation of public schools
by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate
this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in
the numbers dropped even more in later decades
the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the s jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
by whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs
african americans
nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote
despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement
the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens
the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes
partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools
in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs
the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest
black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas
they often donated land and labor as well
beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children
a total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state
several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places
continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south
reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama dropped by nearly half from to
at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city
by birmingham was the th largest city in the united states
heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy
its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution
this did not change until the late s following a lawsuit and court order
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war
rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile
between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries
cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
one result was that jefferson county containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services
urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature
a study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature
in the united states supreme court cases of baker v
carr and reynolds v
sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties
african americans continued to press in the s and s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges
in the us supreme court ruled in brown v
board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply
during the s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation
the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches
these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the us congress
legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court
according to the new york times by many of alabamas african americans were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery
also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american
these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry
in for the first time since the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census
this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years
other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts
alabama has made some changes since the late th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation
in the s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v
crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards
at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats
despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions
as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions
this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters
in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county
in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county
together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens
beginning in the s the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition
steel jobs for instance declined from in to in
however the state particularly huntsville benefited from the opening of the george c

it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either
in reynolds v
sims the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems
at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts
this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas
for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding
through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments
the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws

however executions per capita are significantly higher in texas

the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission
legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county
united states supreme court decisions in baker v
carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote
before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties
the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas

in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war who was known as being the greatest of all the greek warriors
a central character in homers iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia and famous argonaut
achilles was raised in phthia along with his childhood companion patroclus and received his education by the centaur chiron
in the iliad he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the myrmidons
achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy
although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him with an arrow
later legends state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel
according to that myth when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part
alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution
the achilles tendon is named after him following the same legend
linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a ki re u and a ki re we the latter being the dative of the former
the name grew more popular becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form attested in attica in the fourth century bc and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon
achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in a proto form akh luos he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress
the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad
achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of
furthermore las has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster
with this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war
the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership
some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a pre greek language
achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity
robert s
beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of and in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language
achilles was the son of thetisa nereid and daughter of the old man of the seaand peleus the king of the myrmidons
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father
for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods
thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus
zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal
according to the achilleid written by statius in the st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier
in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage
none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability
to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaios son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander
he was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each hand one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood
in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel
in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow hit his torso
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron who lived on mount pelion and was known as the most righteous of the centaurs to be reared
in some accounts achilles original name was ligyron and he was later named achilles by his tutor chiron
according to homer achilles grew up in phthia with his childhood companion patroclus
homer further writes that achilles taught patroclus what he himself had been taught by chiron including the medical arts
thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity
achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war
according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus
when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron
later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot
in the account of dares the phrygian achilles was described having
a large chest a fine mouth and powerfully formed arms and legs
his head was covered with long wavy chestnut colored hair
though mild in manner he was very fierce in battle
his face showed the joy of a man richly endowed
homer described achilles along with numerous other characters as being blond
some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of lycomedes king of skyros
there achilles properly disguised lived among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha cercysera or aissa
with lycomedes daughter deidamia with whom he had begun a relationship achilles there fathered two sons neoptolemus and oneiros
according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid
odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a pedlar selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods
when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign
in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women
while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away
according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons
he appointed five leaders menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon
when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus
in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal
guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy
according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound
achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge
alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed
according to the cypria when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities and killed tenes a son of apollo as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention
in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priams and hecubas five legitimate sons
despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer
prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him
yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios
later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace
in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents
had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides
homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war
achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem
the first two lines of the iliad read the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death
it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces
agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave
her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him
agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks
the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him
achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father
agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles slave briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis
angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces
at the same time burning with rage over agamemnons theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour
as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior
agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix
they promise that if achilles returns to battle agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts
achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he is planning to do
the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp
patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companions death
his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles
she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector
the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem
enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector
achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed
the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus
zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself
finally achilles finds his prey
achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face
after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable
wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses
accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him
achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me
achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot
after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion
at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orions dog a sign of evil
during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the evening western star while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus the morning eastern star has set
with the assistance of the god hermes hectors father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried
achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with a burial on the th
the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come
the aethiopis and a work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce relate further events from the trojan war
when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles
after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later
initially taken aback he did not fight as intensely as usual
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her
following the death of patroclus nestors son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion
when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon
consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon was also the son of a goddess
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the th century bc
the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors
the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times
in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship
homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations
although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors
commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures
in th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one usually a teenager
in patroclus and achilles case achilles would have been the younger as patroclus is usually seen as his elder
in platos symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover
however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women
many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship
the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions
starting with the oldest account in book of the iliad hector predicts with his last dying breath that paris and apollo will slay him at the scaean gates leading to troy
in book the sad spirit of dead patroclus visits achilles just as he drifts off into slumber requesting that his bones be placed with those of achilles in his golden vase a gift of his mother
in book of the odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades
one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead
but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war and odysseus tells him of neoptolemus actions
book of odyssey gives dead king agamemnons ghostly account of achilles death the bleached bones from achilles funeral pyre had been mixed with those of patroclus and put into his mothers golden vase
also the bones of antilochus who had become closer to achilles than any other following patroclus death were separately enclosed
the customary funeral games of a hero were performed and a massive tomb or mound was built on the hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate
achilles was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube
another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena
achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him
according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica
achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both mens presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour
furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades
after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide
odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles
when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus
the armour they fought for was made by hephaestus and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft
thetis had the gear made for achilles because his first set was worn by patroclus when he went to battle and taken by hector when he killed patroclus
the shield of achilles was also made by the fire god
his legendary spear was given to him by his mentor chiron before he participated in the trojan war
it was called the pelian spear which allegedly no other man could wield
a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf
the city was visited in bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the nd century ce
numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions
at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game
they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle
the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena
the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla
achilles cult was also to be found at other places e
on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had a sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero
the cult of achilles is illustrated in the bc polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles
strabo also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus todays black sea appears to have been remarkable
an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island
early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards
the cult was still thriving in the third century ce when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontrchs who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon
pliny the elder in his natural history mentions a port of the achi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him
this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly roman miles away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states
in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron
the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake island
plinys contemporary pomponius mela tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion
ruins of a square temple measuring meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island
a second exploration in showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple
a fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke
in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra regional hero veneration
the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical
already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus
well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it
guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death
the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who likely lived during the first century ce wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white
it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour
similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there
pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame
in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue
leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing
pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound
ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters on the island
strabo mentioned that the cape of the racecourse of achilles was sacred to achilles and although it was treeless was called alsos
alsos in greek means grove
a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles
herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achlleion built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad
later attestations point to an achlleion in messenia and an achlleios in laconia
nicolae densuianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law
the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus
alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor
he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy
in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus
the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars
the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel
extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play
the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today
in platos symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him
the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character
only a few fragments survive
towards the end of the th century bc a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis
the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible
as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions
in hippias minor a socratic dialogue attributed to plato an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates
the two get into a discussion about lying
they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying
socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point
the two also reference homer extensively
socrates and hippias agree that odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle was false intentionally
achilles like odysseus told numerous falsehoods
hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit
the two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident
socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally
the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles
virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children
other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career
this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benot de sainte maures and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the th century
achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars
achilles has been frequently the subject of operas ballets and related genres

a little over one month after lincoln assumed the presidency confederate forces attacked fort sumter a us fort in south carolina
following the bombardment lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union
lincoln a moderate republican had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the democratic and republican parties
his allies the war democrats and the radical republicans demanded harsh treatment of the southern confederates
he managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity carefully distributing political patronage and by appealing to the american people
anti war democrats despised lincoln and some irreconcilable pro confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination
his gettysburg address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of american national purpose
lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort including the selection of generals and implemented a naval blockade of the souths trade
he suspended habeas corpus in maryland and elsewhere and he averted war with britain by defusing the trent affair
in he issued the emancipation proclamation which declared the slaves in the states in rebellion to be free
it also directed the army and navy to recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons and to receive them into the armed service of the united states
lincoln pressured border states to outlaw slavery and he promoted the thirteenth amendment to the us constitution which abolished slavery except as punishment for a crime
lincoln managed his own successful re election campaign
he sought to heal the war torn nation through reconciliation
on april just five days after the confederate surrender at appomattox he was attending a play at fords theatre in washington dc with his wife mary when he was fatally shot by confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth
lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the union and abolish slavery
lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in american history

they had three children sarah abraham and thomas who died as an infant
thomas lincoln bought multiple farms in kentucky but could not get clear titles to any losing hundreds of acres of land in property disputes
in the family moved to indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable
they settled in an unbroken forest in hurricane township perry county indiana
when the lincolns moved to indiana it had just been admitted to the union as a free state except that though no new enslaved people were allowed
currently enslaved individuals remained so
in lincoln noted that the familys move to indiana was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties
in kentucky and indiana thomas worked as a farmer cabinetmaker and carpenter
at various times he owned farms livestock and town lots paid taxes sat on juries appraised estates and served on county patrols
thomas and nancy were members of a separate baptists church which forbade alcohol dancing and slavery

his stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy physical labor but loved to read
lincoln was largely self educated
his formal schooling was from itinerant teachers
it included two short stints in kentucky where he learned to read but probably not to write
at age seven and in indiana due to farm chores he attended school only sporadically for a total of fewer than months in aggregate by age
nonetheless he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning
family neighbors and schoolmates recalled that his readings included the king james bible aesops fables john bunyans the pilgrims progress daniel defoes robinson crusoe and the autobiography of benjamin franklin
despite being self educated lincoln was the recipient of honorary degrees later in life including an honorary doctor of laws from columbia university in june
as a teen lincolns father grew more and more to depend on him for the farming grubbing hoeing making fences necessary to keep the family afloat
he also regularly hired his son out to work
and by law he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age
lincoln was tall strong and athletic and became adept at using an ax
he was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch as catch can style
he became county wrestling champion at the age of
he gained a reputation for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the clarys grove boys
in march fearing another milk sickness outbreak several members of the extended lincoln family including abraham moved west to illinois a free state and settled in macon county
abraham then became increasingly distant from thomas in part due to his fathers lack of interest in education
in as thomas and other family members prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county illinois abraham struck out on his own
he made his home in new salem illinois for six years
lincoln and some friends took goods including live hogs by flatboat to new orleans louisiana where he first witnessed slavery
speculation persists that lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he moved to new salem
however witness testimony given decades afterward showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two
rutledge died on august most likely of typhoid fever lincoln took the death very hard saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on anns grave
lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her
in the early s he met mary owens from kentucky
late in lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem
owens arrived that november and he courted her however they both had second thoughts
on august he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship and she never replied
in lincoln met mary todd in springfield illinois and the following year they became engaged
she was the daughter of robert smith todd a wealthy lawyer and businessman in lexington kentucky
their wedding which was set for january was canceled because lincoln did not appear but they reconciled and married on november in the springfield home of marys sister
while anxiously preparing for the nuptials he was asked where he was going and replied to hell i suppose
in the couple bought a house in springfield near his law office
mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative
lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons though his work regularly kept him away from home
the eldest robert todd lincoln was born in and was the only child to live to maturity
edward baker lincoln born in died february probably of tuberculosis
lincolns third son willie lincoln was born on december and died of a fever at the white house on february
the youngest thomas tad lincoln was born on april and survived his father but died of heart failure at age on july
lincoln was remarkably fond of children and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own
in fact lincolns law partner william h
herndon would grow irritated when lincoln brought his children to the law office
their father it seemed was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior
herndon recounted i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut
lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done
the deaths of their sons eddie and willie had profound effects on both parents
lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition now thought to be clinical depression
later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and in robert committed her to an asylum
during and lincoln worked at a general store in new salem illinois
in he declared his candidacy for the illinois house of representatives but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war
when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war he planned to become a blacksmith but instead formed a partnership with year old william berry with whom he purchased a new salem general store on credit
because a license was required to sell customers beverages berry obtained bartending licenses for each for lincoln and himself and in the lincoln berry general store became a tavern as well
as licensed bartenders lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits including liquor for cents a pint
they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food including takeout dinners
but berry became an alcoholic was often too drunk to work and lincoln ended up running the store by himself
although the economy was booming the business struggled and went into debt causing lincoln to sell his share
in his first campaign speech after returning from his military service lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers and tossed him
in the campaign lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the sangamon river
he could draw crowds as a raconteur but lacked the requisite formal education powerful friends and money and lost the election
lincoln finished eighth out of candidates though he received of the votes cast in the new salem precinct
lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer
rather than studying in the office of an established attorney as was the custom lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys john todd stuart and thomas drummond purchased books including blackstones commentaries and chittys pleadings and read law on his own
he later said of his legal education that i studied with nobody
lincolns second state house campaign in this time as a whig was a success over a powerful whig opponent
then followed his four terms in the illinois house of representatives for sangamon county
he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal and later was a canal commissioner
he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males but adopted a free soil stance opposing both slavery and abolition
in he declared institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils
he echoed henry clays support for the american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia
he was admitted to the illinois bar on september and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john t
stuart mary todds cousin
lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross examinations and closing arguments

lincoln warned that no trans atlantic military giant could ever crush the us as a nation
it cannot come from abroad
if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher said lincoln
prior to that on april an innocent black man francis mcintosh was burned alive in st
louis missouri
zann gill describes how these two murders set off a chain reaction that ultimately prompted abraham lincoln to run for president
true to his record lincoln professed to friends in to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay
their party favored economic modernization in banking tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and urbanization
in lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinoiss th district seat in the us house of representatives he was defeated by john j
hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term
lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in but also won the election
he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line
he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department
lincoln teamed with joshua r
giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter
he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support
on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke against the mexican american war which he imputed president james k
polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
he supported the wilmot proviso a failed proposal to ban slavery in any us territory won from mexico
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions
the war had begun with a killing of american soldiers by mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil
the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political support in his district
one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln
lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on presidential war making powers
lincoln had pledged in to serve only one term in the house
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the presidential election
taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the united states general land office
the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation
this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice
in his springfield practice lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer
twice a year he appeared for consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts this continued for years
lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges
as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him
he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v
rock island bridge company a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge
in he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water
the idea was never commercialized but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent
lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in cases he was sole counsel in cases of which were decided in his favor
from to one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad
his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe
lincoln argued in an criminal trial defending william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness
after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility
armstrong was acquitted
leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent rev
peter cartwright
harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison
lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay
lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule
instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrisons acquittal
the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave holding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of a legislative package designed to address the issue
in his eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue
as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen a
douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery
the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result but douglass kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may
lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech of october
lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency
he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery
i cannot but hate it
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world
lincolns attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life
nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue
reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist
i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists
lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement
in lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat
the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas nebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate
at that time senators were elected by the state legislature
after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain a majority
lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull
trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig
lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson
violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong throughout the north
as the elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party
the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state
lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union
at the june republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john c
frmont and william dayton were on the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois
the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore
buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois
dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the missouri compromise
after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom
his petition was denied in dred scott v
in his opinion supreme court chief justice roger b
taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution and that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners property rights
while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north
lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power
he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
in douglas was up for re election in the us senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him
many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in and lincolns campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor
some eastern republicans supported douglas for his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state
many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference
for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition
lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal
after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion
the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas
when informed of lincolns nomination douglas stated is the strong man of the party
and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won
the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas
these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands
the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically
lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and he accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal
in his freeport doctrine douglas argued that despite the dred scott decision which he claimed to support local settlers under the doctrine of popular sovereignty should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory and he accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists
lincolns argument assumed a moral tone as he claimed that douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery
douglass argument was more legal in nature claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the us supreme court as exercised in the dred scott decision
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas
however lincolns articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence
in may lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger a german language newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the states german americans voted for democrats but the german language paper mobilized republican support
in the aftermath of the election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william h
seward salmon p
chase edward bates and simon cameron
while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office
in january lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy
over the coming months lincoln was tireless making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail
by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric he quickly became the champion of the republican party
however despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states he was less appreciated in the east
horace greeley editor of the new york tribune at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred scott ruling which was promptly used against him by his political rivals
on february powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery
he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly
but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership which brought him into contention
journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience
historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant
appearing in sewards home state sponsored by a group largely loyal to chase lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these republican rivals for the nomination
in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little
on may the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement
exploiting his embellished frontier legend lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate
in lincoln described himself i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes
michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign
at times he was presented as the plain talking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe unpolished but trustworthy
on may at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase
a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket
lincolns success depended on his campaign team his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff
pennsylvania put him over the top led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support
lincolns managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincolns dictate to make no contracts that will bind me
as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party
throughout the s lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession
when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglass position on popular sovereignty and selected incumbent vice president john c
breckinridge as their candidate
a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee
lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south
before the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties
people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln
as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party
the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials
republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story emphasizing his childhood poverty
the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts
the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold copies
though he did not give public appearances many sought to visit him and write him
in the runup to the election he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention
he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary who would remain in that role during the presidency
on november lincoln was elected the th president
he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west
no ballots were cast for him in of the southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the southern states an omen of the impending civil war
lincoln received votes or of the total in a four way race carrying the free northern states as well as california and oregon
his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had votes to for his opponents
the south was outraged by lincolns election and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march
on december south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed
six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america and adopted a constitution
the upper south and border states initially rejected the secessionist appeal
president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal
the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february
attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of free soil in the territories
lincoln said i will suffer death before i consent
to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right
lincoln supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office
that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed
on march in his first inaugural address lincoln said that because he holds such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution
on february lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield he would never again return to springfield alive
lincoln traveled east in a special train
due to secessionist plots a then unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train
en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north
the president elect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore
he traveled in disguise wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary stovepipe hat and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching slightly to conceal his height
his friend congressman elihu b
washburne recognized him on the platform upon arrival and loudly called out to him
on february he arrived in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard
lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states major robert anderson commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent a request for provisions to washington and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war
on april confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight
historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war
donald concludes his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on fort sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood
but he had also vowed not to surrender the forts
the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot
they did just that
on april lincoln called on the states to send a total of volunteer troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states
this call forced states to choose sides
virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines
north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed over the following two months
secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky remained neutral
the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to defend the nation
as states sent union regiments south on april baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains
local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials
lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach washington
john merryman one maryland official hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger b
taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus
in june in ex parte merryman taney not ruling on behalf of the supreme court issued the writ believing that article i section of the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend it
but lincoln invoked nonacquiescence and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas
lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy
he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander in chief by exercising unprecedented authority
he expanded his war powers imposed a blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers
lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions
lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict
it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions
copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery
the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
on august lincoln signed the confiscation act of which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates
the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery
in august general john c
frmont the republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels
lincoln canceled the proclamation as violating the confiscation act of and beyond frmonts authority to issue
as a result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over
internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy
he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner
in the trent affair which threatened war with great britain the us navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered
lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats
biographer james g
randall dissected lincolns successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department
he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party
in january after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton
stanton centralized the war departments activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government
stanton was a staunch unionist pro business conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction
he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than did any other senior official
stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman
lincolns war strategy had two priorities ensuring that washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt decisive victory
twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon
occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard
for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoine henri jomini
lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river
lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than merely capturing territory
in directing the unions war strategy lincoln valued the advice of gen
winfield scott even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army
on june lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department
after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement lincoln appointed major general george b
mcclellan general in chief
mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign
mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington
mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capital
in lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction
he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia
pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north thereby protecting washington from counterattack
but in the summer of pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington
two days after mcclellans return to command general robert e
lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam
that battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january
mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee
lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside
the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part
against presidential advice burnside launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december
desertions during came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker
in the midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market
the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations
in the spring of lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned and was replaced by george meade
meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands
at the same time grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river splitting the far western rebel states
the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states
lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented because these territories would be admitted to the union as free states and free states would come to outnumber slave states
he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves
lincoln rejected major general john c
frmonts august emancipation attempt as well as one by major general david hunter in may on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede
in june congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory which lincoln signed
in july the confiscation act of was enacted providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional
he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander in chief which he planned to exercise
on july lincoln reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet
peace democrats argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification but republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune in his public letter the prayer of twenty millions implored lincoln to embrace emancipation
in a public letter of august lincoln replied to greeley writing that while he personally wished all men could be free his first obligation as president was to preserve the union when lincoln published his reply to greeley he had already decided to issue the preliminary emancipation proclamation and therefore had already chosen the third option he mentioned in his letter to greeley to free some of the slaves namely those in the states in rebellion
some scholars therefore believe that his reply to greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the union
on september lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation which announced that in states still in rebellion on january the slaves would be freed
he spent the next days between september and january preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites
at the same time during those days lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact suggesting that he still took seriously the first option he mentioned in his letter to greeley saving the union without freeing any slave
but on january keeping his word lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves in states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas under such control
lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper
with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective union armies advancing south enable thousands of slaves to escape to freedom
the emancipation proclamation having stated that freedmen would be received into the armed service of the united states enlisting these freedmen became official policy
by the spring of lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers
in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of fifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once
by the end of at lincolns direction general lorenzo thomas had enrolled twenty regiments of african americans from the mississippi valley
lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november
in words and three minutes lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in but in conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all
he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that the future of democracy would be assured and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
defying his prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history
general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln
responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i cant spare this man
he fights
with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters while also including black troops
meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander
grant then assumed command of meades army
lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in
he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions and once assured that he had none lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington
authorization for such a promotion with the advice and consent of the senate was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate
his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march
grant in waged the bloody overland campaign which exacted heavy losses on both sides
when lincoln asked what grants plans were the persistent general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer
grants army moved steadily south
lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman
lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north
lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure plantations railroads and bridges hoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability
he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction for its own sake
lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in when confederate general jubal early raided washington dc legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position union captain oliver wendell holmes jr shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot but this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal
as grant continued to weaken lees forces efforts to discuss peace began
confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads
lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal his objective to end the fighting was not realized
on april grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege
the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital
on april lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war
lincoln ran for reelection in while uniting the main republican factions along with war democrats edwin m
stanton and andrew johnson
lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers greatly expanded from peacetime to build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him
at its convention the republican party selected johnson as his running mate
to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party
grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns re election prospects and many republicans feared defeat
lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope
the pledge read as follows the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure but their candidate mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform
meanwhile lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support
shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism
the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln
the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation
state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads
on november lincoln carried all but three states including percent of union soldiers
on march lincoln delivered his second inaugural address
in it he deemed the war casualties to be gods will
historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial
lincoln said among those present for this speech was actor john wilkes booth who on april just over a month after lincolns second inauguration assassinated him
reconstruction preceded the wars end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves
when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy
lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states
his main goal was to keep the union together so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame but on how to rebuild the nation as one
lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals under rep
thaddeus stevens sen
charles sumner and sen
benjamin wade who otherwise remained lincolns allies
determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held
his amnesty proclamation of december offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance
as southern states fell they needed leaders while their administrations were restored
in tennessee and arkansas lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors
in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p
banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when percent of the voters agreed and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery
democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations
the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill which lincoln vetoed
the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee
lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals
to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court he named the radicals choice salmon p
chase who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies
after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment
he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december an amendment was brought to congress
the senate passed it on april but the first vote in the house of representatives fell short of the required two thirds majority
passage became part of lincolns reelection platform and after his successful reelection the second attempt in the house passed on january
with ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december
lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen
he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves
the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen
lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short term military control pending readmission under the control of southern unionists
historians agree that it is impossible to predict how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived
biographers james g
randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that lincolns relationship with native americans started before he was born with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons including lincolns father thomas
lincoln himself served as a captain in the state militia during the black hawk war but saw no combat
lincoln used appointments to the indian bureau as a reward to supporters from minnesota and wisconsin
while in office his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraphs from indian attacks
on august the dakota war broke out in minnesota
hundreds of settlers were killed were displaced from their homes and washington was deeply alarmed
some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier
lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising
when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in minnesota
lincoln sent general john pope as commander of the new department of the northwest two weeks into the hostilities
before he arrived the fond du lac band of chippewa sent lincoln a letter asking to go to war for the united states against the sioux so lincoln could send minnesotas troops to fight the south
in it the chippewa specified they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare
that meant there would be no prisoners of war no surrender no peace agreement
lincoln did not accept the chippewa offer as he could not control the chippewa and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native american warfare
serving under gen
pope was minnesota congressman henry h
minnesotas governor had made sibley a colonel united states volunteers to command the us force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated little crows forces at the battle of wood lake
the day the mdewakanton force surrendered at camp release a chippewa war council met at minnesotas capitol with another chippewa offer to lincoln to fight the sioux
sibley thought he had of the men he wanted for trial while gen
pope ordered all detained be tried
were given death sentences that were subject to presidential review
lincoln ordered pope send all trial transcripts to washington where lincoln and two of his staff examined them
lincoln realized the trials could be divided into two groups combat between combatants and combat against civilians
the groups could be identified by their transcripts the first group all had three pages in length while the second group had more some up to twelve pages
he placed cases into the first group and commuted their sentences
in the second group were forty cases
one he commuted for becoming a states witness
sibley dismissed another when proof surfaced exonerating the defendant
the remaining were executed in the largest mass hanging in us history
questions arose concerning three executions that have not been answered
less than months afterwards lincoln issued the lieber code which governed wartime conduct of the union army by defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity
congressman alexander ramsey told lincoln in he would have gotten more re election support in minnesota had he executed all of the mdewakanton
lincoln responded i could not afford to hang men for votes
the men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at davenport iowa
some he released due to the efforts of bishop henry whipple
lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating
under this philosophy lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency including the wade davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program
the homestead act made millions of acres of western government held land available for purchase at low cost
the morrill land grant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state
the pacific railway acts of and granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in
the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the s
in the selection and use of his cabinet lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency
lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet
we needed to hold our own people together
i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men
then i had no right to deprive the country of their services
goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals
there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs and a federal income tax
in lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs following the first enacted by buchanan
he also signed the revenue act of creating the first us income tax a flat tax of percent on incomes above
the revenue act of adopted rates that increased with income
the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas
the national banking act created the system of national banks
the us issued paper currency for the first time known as greenbacks printed in green on the reverse side
in congress created the department of agriculture
in response to rumors of a renewed draft the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market
lincoln attacked the media for such behavior and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days
lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday
thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the th century
it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates
the prior proclamation had been during james madisons presidency years earlier
in lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving
in june lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park
lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it
therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known
lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court
noah haynes swayne was an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union
samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the election and was an avowed abolitionist
david davis was lincolns campaign manager in and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced
democrat stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice provided geographic and political balance
finally lincolns treasury secretary salmon p
chase became chief justice
lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party
lincoln named his main political rival william h
seward as secretary of state and left most diplomatic issues in sewards portfolio
however lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy
he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with britain
sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy
he was successful after indicating to britain and france that the union would declare war on them if they supported the south
john wilkes booth was a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service
after attending lincolns last public address on april in which lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men specifically on the very intelligent and on those who serve our cause as soldiers booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president
when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre
lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse
at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play
at in the evening booth entered the back of lincolns theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincolns head mortally wounding him
lincolns guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped
after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house

stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages
lincolns body was placed in a flag wrapped coffin which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers
president johnson was sworn in later that same day
two weeks later booth refusing to surrender was tracked to a farm in virginia
he was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april
secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed
after a brief interview stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge
the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april to
the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train
the train followed a circuitous route from washington dc to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands
many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief
poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him one of four poems he wrote about lincoln
african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses
in a larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war
historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death
lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb
as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic
he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it
he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others
he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs
throughout his public career lincoln often quoted scripture
his three most famous speeches the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural all contain direct allusions to providence and quote from scripture
in the s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power
with the death of his son edward in he more frequently expressed a dependence on god
he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in
in the s lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals instead he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence
the death of his son willie in february may have caused him to look toward religion for solace
after willies death he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity
he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest
yet the contest began
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day
yet the contest proceeds
lincoln did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by was expressing that belief in major speeches
by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april to a newspaper editor in kentucky this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least
lincoln explains therein that the cause purpose and result of the war was gods will
lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants
on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land
lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria
he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation
it is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning
several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination
these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting
it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type b
lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry v
jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman j
lincoln called the declaration of independence which emphasized freedom and equality for all the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the s
he did this at a time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse
diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the cooper union speech
instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism
his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract
furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state
many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs
as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats
lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise
nevertheless lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism
according to historian sean wilentz william c
harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism
james g
randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform
randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders
in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy
he denounced secession as anarchy and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints
he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people
the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country
the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural and other times in the singular
the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century
in surveys of us scholars ranking presidents conducted since the top three presidents are generally lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies
between and lincoln john f
kennedy and ronald reagan were the top ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys according to gallup
a study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington
lincolns assassination left him a national martyr
he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty
republicans linked lincolns name to their party
many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability
historians have said he was a classical liberal in the th century sense
allen c
guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democrat an enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office
sociologist barry schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners
the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt
in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state
schwartz argues that in the s and s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life
during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful
franklin d
roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan
americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness
he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept
in the cold war years lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes
he had long been known as the great emancipator but by the late s some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr denied that lincoln deserved that title
bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in
he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks
bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country
the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them
defenders of lincoln such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible
dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously pointing to his narrow political agenda and faulty research
by the s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives apart from neo confederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white south for his intense nationalism his support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery his acting on lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers
lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world
barry schwartz wrote in that lincolns image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century
on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason
in the st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies
lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light
lincoln has also been admired by political figures outside the us including german political theorist karl marx indian independence leader mahatma gandhi former liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf leader of the italian risorgimento giuseppe garibaldi and libyan revolutionary muammar gaddafi
lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the bill
he appears on postage stamps across the world
while he is usually portrayed bearded he did not grow a beard until at the suggestion of year old grace bedell
he was the first of five presidents to do so
he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska
the united states navy is named after lincoln the second navy ship to bear his name
the lincoln memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital and is one of the most visited national park service sites in the country
fords theatre among the most visited sites in washington dc is across the street from petersen house where lincoln died

aristotle was an ancient greek philosopher and polymath
his writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences philosophy linguistics economics politics psychology and the arts
as the founder of the peripatetic school of philosophy in the lyceum in athens he began the wider aristotelian tradition that followed which set the groundwork for the development of modern science
little is known about aristotles life
he was born in the city of stagira in northern greece during the classical period
his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian
at or he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of
shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored his son alexander the great beginning in bc
he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls
though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication
aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him
his teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion
aristotles views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship
the influence of his physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and was not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed
he influenced judeo islamic philosophies during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church
aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher while the poet dante called him the master of those who know
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and jean buridan
aristotles influence on logic continued well into the th century
in addition his ethics although always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics
in general the details of aristotles life are not well established
the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points
aristotle was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km east of modern day thessaloniki
his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon
while he was young aristotle learned about biology and medical information which was taught by his father
both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian
although little information about aristotles childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy
at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy
he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn
aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in bc
the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died
aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor
after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon
while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece
they had a daughter whom they also named pythias
in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon
during aristotles time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric
in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants
by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years
while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira
they had a son whom aristotle named after his father nicomachus
if the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages is accurate he may also have had an ermenos palaephatus of abydus
this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works
he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived
those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students
his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics
aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre
near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death
following alexanders death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled
in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athenss trial and execution of socrates
he died in chalcis euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife
with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic
kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion
most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers
the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers
the books are the order of the books is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings
it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms and dialectics
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning
the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics
what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism aristotle himself would have labelled analytics
the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics
the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics
aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science as the contemplative philosophy which is theological and studies the divine
he wrote in his metaphysics aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence in his metaphysics and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism
in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed
for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc
or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form
like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the universal
aristotles ontology places the universal in particulars things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate
for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance
plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things
when one looks at an apple for example one sees an apple and one can also analyse a form of an apple
in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple
moreover one can place an apple next to a book so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things
for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form
aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things
in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals
where plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated
so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms
coming to be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality and actuality in association with the matter and the form
referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else
for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially a plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant
potentially beings can either act or be acted upon which can be either innate or learned
for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning
actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality
because the end is the principle of every change and potentiality exists for the sake of the end actuality accordingly is the end
referring then to the previous example it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do
in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end
then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality
with this definition of the particular substance aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being and the actual one are one and the same
aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these
aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles
aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences
in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences
aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry
aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science
however his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method
for aristotle all science is either practical poetical or theoretical
his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics
in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry
in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions
aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets
aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens
in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction
with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster
this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics
natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens while the empedoclean elements move vertically up or down towards their natural resting places
in the physics aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional to its weight w and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible
opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws
henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this
archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition
aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period
john philoponus and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect
a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air
in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium
newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus
aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors
his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here
aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems book
the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in
with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the suns image always remained circular
he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image
according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous
there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to peoples moral choices
in astronomy aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out partly correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then
the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them
he also wrote descriptions of comets including the great comet of bc
aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations
he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime
the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption
meteorologica lends its name to the modern study of meteorology but its modern usage diverges from the content of aristotles ancient treatise on meteors
the ancient greeks did use the term for a range of atmospheric phenomena but also for earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
aristotle proposed that the cause of earthquakes was a gas or vapor that was trapped inside the earth and trying to escape following other greek authors anaxagoras empedocles and democritus
aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle
for example he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early and correctly that when seawater is heated freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings
he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos
his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas
his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived
aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen
he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus
his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the th century
he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark
he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function so birds like the heron have a long neck long legs and a sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet
darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution
aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents
for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes
he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results
to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct
aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense
he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection
in generation of animals he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside
instead he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these
this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics
it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed
in this sense aristotles biology is scientific
from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods that he studied
among these correct predictions are the following
brood size decreases with body mass so that an elephant has fewer young per brood than a mouse
lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier
as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice
aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a nonreligious version of the scala naturae with man at the top
his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs
animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals
he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood
those with blood were divided into the live bearing and the egg laying
those without blood were insects crustacea and the hard shelled molluscs
he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods
to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution
philosophers of science have generally concluded that aristotle was not interested in taxonomy but zoologists who studied this question in the early st century think otherwise
he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design
aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul posits three kinds of soul the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul
humans have all three
the vegetative soul is concerned with growth and nourishment
the sensitive soul experiences sensations and movement
the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous and logos
for aristotle the soul is the form of a living being
because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement
in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain
notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon
in on the soul aristotle famously criticizes platos theory of the soul and develops his own in response
the first criticism is against platos view of the soul in the timaeus that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies
th century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed aristotles interpretation of plato and maintained that he had misunderstood him
todays scholars have tended to re assess aristotles interpretation and been more positive about it
aristotles other criticism is that platos view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis matched in principle aristotle alleges any soul can go with any body according to platos theory
aristotles claim that the soul is the form of a living being eliminates that possibility and thus rules out reincarnation
according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past
in other words a memory is a mental picture that can be recovered
aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory
a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once
these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian and thinking
aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents
memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present
retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly
a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences both for previous experience and present experience
because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences
to search for these impressions people search the memory itself
within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for
recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another
if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next
when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed
recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression
only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words
animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations
remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed
aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association
aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind
a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience
according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled
aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness
sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body
while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness
since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire which is the result of sensation
however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus
in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner
aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then looks away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion
when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression
when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored
however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences
so dreams result from these lasting impressions
since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience
during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind
aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus
for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings
since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person
this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature
in de anima iii aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia
one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs
he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being
aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences
aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it
if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred
secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream
for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream
lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences
aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric
aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake
he wrote several treatises on ethics most notably including the nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight
aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch in accordance with reason
aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being
to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom and their intellect can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher
in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics
aristotle considered the city to be a natural community
moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part
he famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and argued that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality
aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others
aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city which functions as a political community or partnership
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together
this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences
aristotles views on women influenced later western philosophers who quoted him as an authority until the end of the middle ages but these views have been controversial in modern times
aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element
the biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well suited for reproduction which changes her body temperature which in turn makes her in aristotles view incapable of participating in political life
on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism
however aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men
aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages
in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade
his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbinss view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements
aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature
in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money
money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus
for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver
aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages
he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit
it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself
he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural
similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use
aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time
he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement
money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable
he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security
that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it
aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos pathos and logos
he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic forensic and deliberative
aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme and paradeigma
aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis each varying in imitation by medium object and manner
he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself
aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature
because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes
for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language
the forms also differ in their object of imitation
comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average
lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama
while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived
aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry
the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy
tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions
aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis
he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic
aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop
more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived
he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields
according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did
among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method
taneli kukkonen observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long
as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones
evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind
jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought
aristotle has been called the father of logic biology political science zoology embryology natural law scientific method rhetoric psychology realism criticism individualism teleology and meteorology
the scholar taneli kukkonen notes that in the best th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition
what follows is an overview of the transmission and influence of his texts and ideas into the modern era
aristotles pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants a pioneering work in botany
some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber
theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned
the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school
aristotles students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus
aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers
he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher
although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work
though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly
it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found
the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation
herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not
though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries
ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance
following the decline of the roman empire aristotles vast philosophical and scientific corpus lay largely dormant in the west
however his works underwent a remarkable revival in the abbasid caliphate
translated into arabic alongside other greek classics aristotles logic ethics and natural philosophy ignited the minds of early islamic scholars
through meticulous commentaries and critical engagements figures like al farabi and ibn sina breathed new life into aristotles ideas
they harmonized his logic with islamic theology employed his scientific methodologies to explore the natural world and even reinterpreted his ethics within the framework of islamic morality
this revival was not mere imitation
islamic thinkers embraced aristotles rigorous methods while simultaneously challenging his conclusions where they diverged from their own religious beliefs
greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus
the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century
john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought
philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations
after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena
aristotle was one of the most revered thinkers in early islamic theology
most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars
averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers
alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers
medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher
the title was later used by western philosophers who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy
with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke
after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance
these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages
scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic
according to scholar roger theodore lafferty dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking
dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of albert magnus
dante even acknowledges aristotles influence explicitly in the poem specifically when virgil justifies the infernos structure by citing the nicomachean ethics
dante famously refers to him as he who is acknowledged master of those who know
moses maimonides adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy
maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived and styled him as the chief of the philosophers
also in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are sufficient by themselves and to all that were written before them
his intellect aristotles is the extreme limit of human intellect apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy there being no level higher
in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment
harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat as aristotle thought
galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight
the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his book the laws of thought
this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two
charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology
in an letter he wrote that linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods though in very different ways but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle
also in later editions of the book on the origin of species darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle the text he cites is a summary by aristotle of the ideas of the earlier greek philosopher empedocles
the philosopher bertrand russell claims that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine
russell calls aristotles ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy
russell states that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors
the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis writes that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceed so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses
in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility
zoologists have frequently mocked aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports
however modern observation has confirmed several of his more surprising claims
aristotles work remains largely unknown to modern scientists though zoologists sometimes mention him as the father of biology or in particular of marine biology
practising zoologists are unlikely to adhere to aristotles chain of being but its influence is still perceptible in the use of the terms lower and upper to designate taxa such as groups of plants
the evolutionary biologist armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology while niko tinbergens four questions based on aristotles four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny
the concept of homology began with aristotle the evolutionary developmental biologist lewis i
held commented that he would be interested in the concept of deep homology
the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum
these texts as opposed to aristotles lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school
reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works
aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era
his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school
aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus
whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication
ciceros description of aristotles literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes
a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones now possessed came to be found
the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today
according to strabo and plutarch after aristotles death his library and writings went to theophrastus
after the death of theophrastus the peripatetic library went to neleus of scepsis
some time later the kingdom of pergamon began conscripting books for a royal library and the heirs of neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose
the library was stored there for about a century and a half in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation
on the death of attalus iii which also ended the royal library ambitions the existence of aristotelian library was disclosed and it was purchased by apellicon and returned to athens in about bc
apellicon sought to recover the texts many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored
he had them copied out into new manuscripts and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable
when sulla seized athens in bc he seized the library and transferred it to rome
there andronicus of rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of aristotles works
the aristotelian texts we have today are based on these
aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries
among the best known depictions is raphaels fresco the school of athens in the vaticans apostolic palace where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image at the architectural vanishing point reflecting their importance
rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer too is a celebrated work showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones writes this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world ensnaring us in its musty glowing pitch black terrible knowledge of time
the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle
he was the first person known to conjecture in his book meteorology the existence of a landmass in the southern high latitude region which he called antarctica
aristoteles is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotles name
the secondary literature on aristotle is vast
the following is only a small selection
an american in paris is a jazz influenced symphonic poem for orchestra by american composer george gershwin first performed in
it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the
gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns
he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic
it was damrosch who had commissioned gershwin to write his concerto in f following the earlier success of rhapsody in blue
he completed the orchestration on november less than four weeks before the works premiere
he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor
although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study with ravel
after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be a second rate ravel when you can be a first rate gershwin gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour
to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel
gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march during a party held for ravels birthday by va gauthier
ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel
ravels high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris
yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him
boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could i give you that you havent already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w
yeats ernest hemingway f
scott fitzgerald and artist pablo picasso
gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer
gershwin called it a rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works
gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere
the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose a b a format
gershwins first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six
this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns
the b sections andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness
the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues
in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum
moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a
after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso
gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris
he stated that damroschs sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work
the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses
critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwins concerto in f
evening post did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers csar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere
gershwin responded to the critics an american in paris was originally scored for flutes oboes english horn clarinets in b flat bass clarinet in b flat bassoons horns in f trumpets in b flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone and strings
although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it had been gershwins intention to use the notes a b d and a
it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played
a major revision of the work by composer and arranger f
campbell watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments
this became the standard performing edition until when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwins original manuscript including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watsons revision
gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian
william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in
on september it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released
the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent
it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process
the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released
the entire project was expected to take to years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series
two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher b note music in
the changes made by campbell watson were withdrawn in both editions
in the extended urtext bars of music were re integrated
conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance
on september the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan
this performance was of the original orchestration
an american in paris has been frequently recorded
the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra
gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio
then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording
this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat b flat a higher d and a lower a
the radio broadcast of the september hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in a two cd set
arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music
in arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in of gershwins original score before numerous edits were made resulting in the score as we hear it today
the blues section of an american in paris has been recorded separately by a number of artists ralph flanagan his orchestra released it as a single in which reached no
on the billboard chart
harry james released a version of the blues section on his album one night stand recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago
in metro goldwyn mayer released the musical film an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron and directed by vincente minnelli
winning the best picture oscar and numerous other awards the film featured many tunes of gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the symphonic poem an american in paris which at the time was the most expensive musical number ever filmed costing
the academy award for best production design recognizes achievement for art direction in film
the categorys original name was best art direction but was changed to its current name in for the th academy awards
this change resulted from the art directors branch of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences being renamed the designers branch
since the award is shared with the set decorators
it is awarded to the best interior design in a film
the films below are listed with their production year
in the lists below the winner of the award for each year is shown first followed by the other nominees in alphabetical order
the academy awards of merit commonly known as the oscars or academy awards are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry
they are presented annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences in the united states in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academys voting membership
the oscars are widely considered to be the most prestigious awards in the film industry
the major award categories are presented during a live televised hollywood ceremony that is typically held in february or march
it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony
the st academy awards were held in
the second ceremony in was the first one broadcast by radio
the ceremony was the first one televised
it is the oldest of the four major annual american entertainment awards
its equivalents the emmy awards for television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music are modeled after the academy awards
the oscar statuette depicts a knight rendered in the art deco style
the first academy awards presentation was held on may at a private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about people
the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel
the cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was at prices
fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the period
the ceremony ran for minutes
for this first ceremony winners were announced to the media three months earlier
for the second ceremony in and the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards
in the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began
as a result in the academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners
the term oscar is a registered trademark of the ampas
in the italian language it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony regardless of which field
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh
he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier
this made him the first academy award winner in history
at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period
for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films
with the fourth ceremony the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film
for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years
at the th ceremony held in the best foreign language film category now known as best international feature film was introduced
until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award
perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was year old robert opel who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing a peace sign on national us television at the th academy awards in
bemused host david niven quipped isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings
later evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr robert metzler the shows business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way
during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be
the th academy awards held in presented the first academy award for best animated feature
since all academy awards ceremonies except for have ended with the academy award for best picture
traditionally the previous years winners for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress respectively
the previous years winners for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor
on february parasite became the first foreign language film to win best picture at the nd academy awards
that same evening tom hanks announced the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures originally slated for december
the museum development started in under kerry brougher but is now led by bill kramer
the industry curated exhibits are geared toward the history of motion pictures and the art science of film making exhibiting trailblazing directors actors film makers sound editors and more and the museum houses famous artifacts from acclaimed movies such as dorothys ruby red slippers from the wizard of oz
the rd academy awards ceremony honoring the best films of and early was held on april after it was postponed from its original february schedule due to the impact of the covid pandemic on cinema
as with the two previous ceremonies there was no host
the ceremony was broadcast on abc
it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles california for the th consecutive year along with satellite location taking place at the union station also in los angeles
because of the virus impact on films and tv industries academy president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson announced that for the oscar ceremony streaming movies with a previously planned theatrical release were eligible
the theatrical requirement was reinstated starting with the th academy awards
the oscar statuette officially the academy award of merit is given to winners of each years awards
made of gold plated bronze on a black metal base it is in tall weighs lb and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes
the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians
sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted cedric gibbons design
the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze
within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally karat gold
due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years
following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones
the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base
the original oscar mold was cast in at the cw shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes
from to approximately oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer rs owens company
it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture statuettes
in the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to walden new york based polich tallix fine art foundry now owned and operated by uap urban art projects
while based on a digital scan of an original oscar the statuettes retain their modern era dimensions and black pedestal
cast in liquid bronze from d printed ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in karat gold by brooklyn new york based epner technology
the time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months
rs owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating
the origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy oscar
margaret herrick librarian and president of the academy may have said she named it after her supposed uncle oscar in
the only corroboration was a clipping from the los angeles examiner in which herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase hows your uncle oscar
bette davis in her autobiography claimed she named it in after her first husband harmon oscar nelson of whom the statues rear end reminded her
but the term had been in use at least two years before
in a biography written by whitney stine with commentary from davis davis wrote i relinquish once and for all any claim that i was the one so academy of motion picture arts and sciences the honor is all yours
columnist sidney skolsky wrote in his memoir that he came up with the term in under pressure for a deadline mocking vaudeville comedians who asked will you have a cigar oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march which was written about that years th academy awards
but in the newspaper clipping that skolsky referred to he wrote that these statues are called oscars meaning that the name was already in use
bruce davis a former executive director of the academy credited eleanore lilleberg a secretary at the academy when the award was first introduced for the nickname
she had overseen the pre ceremony handling of the awards
davis credits lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of einar lilleberg eleanores brother that einar had referenced a norwegian army veteran named oscar that the two knew in chicago whom einar described as having always stood straight and tall
he asserts credit should almost certainly belong to lilleberg
in brazilian researcher dr waldemar dalenogare neto found the probable first public mention of the name oscar in journalist relman morins cinematters column in the los angeles evening post record on december
since the awards didnt take place that year he said whats happened to the annual academy banquet as a rule the banquet and the awarding of oscar the bronze statuette given for best performances is all over long before this
this information changes the version of sidney skolsky as the first to publicly mention the name
to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates
until winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars
since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governors ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony
the rs owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner
the nameplates for the non winning nominees are later recycled
prior to oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient
since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us
if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette
academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums
in michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his production of around the world in days to a movie prop collector
the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale
in harold russell consigned his oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses
though his decision caused controversy the first oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on august for
russell defended his action saying i dont know why anybody would be critical
my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons
the movie will be here even if oscar isnt
in december orson welles oscar for citizen kane was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy
on december it sold in an online auction for us
some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury
the academy also awards nicholl fellowships in screenwriting
from to the academy award nomination results were announced to the public in mid january
prior to that the results were announced in early february
in the nominees were announced in march
in the nominees were announced in early february for the first time since
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of
academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production
actors constitute the largest bloc numbering
votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse since the th academy awards in
in may the academy sent a letter advising its or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in replacing mailed paper ballots
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees
membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or an existing member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures
new membership proposals are considered annually
the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join
in the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately of ampas voting membership
of the active voters confirmed were caucasian were male and were found to be over the age of

according to rules and of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january to midnight at the end of december in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best international feature film best documentary feature and awards in short film categories
the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between pm and pm local time
for example the best picture winner the hurt locker was originally first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards
foreign films must include english subtitles
each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year
rule states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of minutes except for short subject awards
it must exist either on a mm or mm film print or in frame s or frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of by pixels
since the th academy awards presented in multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award
this followed the win of an eight hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in
the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film
the best international feature film award does not require a us release
it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection
the best documentary feature award requires either week long releases in both los angeles county and any of the five boroughs of new york city during the previous calendar year or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list regardless of any public exhibition or distribution or submission in the international feature film category as its countrys official selection
the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings
a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times time out new york the los angeles times or la weekly
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline
in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year
the form includes the production credits for all related categories
then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases
awards in short film categories have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards
first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead covering one year starting on october and ending on september of the calendar year before the ceremony
second there are multiple methods of qualification
the main method is a week long theatrical release in either new york city or los angeles county during the eligibility period
films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy also without regard to prior public distribution
a film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible
the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards
only one screening per day is required
for the documentary award the screening must start between noon and pm local time
for other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times
in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around active members
for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ie only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc
in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees
in all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ranked preferentially
in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches
in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members
since the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting
since re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects
film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season
the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified
it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders
for example a producer of the best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner
the hurt locker eventually won
the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films in one place
it was introduced in for the oscars
dvd screeners and academy in person screenings were still provided
for films to be included on the platform the north american distributor must pay including a watermarking fee and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy
the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players
the watermarking process involved several video security firms creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings
in for the oscars the academy banned all physical screeners and in person screenings restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room
films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform
distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform
the in person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid pandemic
eligible films do not have to be added to the platform but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are
the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees
it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year
this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day
black tie dress is the most common outfit for men
fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers are sometimes not required to adhere to this
the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast
the academy awards is the worlds longest running awards show televised live from the us to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world
the oscars were first televised in by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in to
nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in and its current contract with the academy runs through
the academy has produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots
the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast
by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in countries
in the rights were sold to countries and by the tv rights to the awards were licensed in countries
in the ceremonies were moved up from late march early april to late february to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry
another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa division i mens basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience
in and abcs regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite the national championship game on nbc
the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period
some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games
another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public
advertising is somewhat restricted as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast
as of the production of the academy awards telecast held the distinction of winning one the highest number of emmys in history with wins and nominations overall
after many years of being held on mondays at pm pacific pm eastern since the ceremonies it was moved to sundays at pm pt pm et
the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier
for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office
in the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season
however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail
furthermore a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games
in the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nd academy awards in
in the ceremony was moved to an even earlier start time of pm pt pm et the apparent impetus being the ability for abc to air a half hour of primetime programming as a lead out program at pm pt pm et originally scheduled for april the th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march the rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the attempted assassination of president ronald reagan and others in washington dc in an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members
this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names
criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact
the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead
this segment was later followed by a commercial break
in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours
the first oscars in lasted minutes
at the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes
in the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds
this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion
in in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker
during the ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night a reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread
the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the telecasts as follows on song performances on the hosts speeches on prerecorded clips and on the awards themselves broken into on the introduction and announcement on winners walking to the stage and on their acceptance speeches
although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped
the th academy awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years while the show itself also faced mixed reception
following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself
currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions
in august ampas extended its contract with abc to the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast
historically the telecasts viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the best picture award
more than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th academy awards in the year of titanic which generated a box office haul during its initial run of us million in the us a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years
the th academy awards ceremony in which received awards including best picture drew million viewers
the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date was the nd academy awards which drew a household rating on april
hoping to reinvigorate the pre show and ratings the oscars organizers hired members of the met gala creative team
by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critical acclaim those films have received
the th academy awards which awarded a low budget independent film generated an audience of million with a household rating of
in the th academy awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the academy awards
the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film
whereas the nd academy awards drew an average of million viewers the rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of million the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in
the th and th editions drew and million viewers respectively still below the audience of the nd edition
the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the oscars as well as material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows
copies are held in a variety of film video and digital formats
in the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel
from to the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles
graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from to
the st academy awards in were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood
from to the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre
with the advent of television the awards from to took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles
in the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california
in the academy moved the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center
in the late s and early s the ceremony returned to the shrine auditorium
in hollywoods dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentations current venue
in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy
at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical
from the s to the s the art direction cinematography and costume design awards were split into two categories
prior to the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup
in august the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony
following dissent from academy members they announced that they would air all categories live
this followed several proposals among them the introduction of a popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement
the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories
to date the following categories have been proposed the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole
they are not always presented on an annual basis
due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend around million dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season
this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing and lobbying than by quality
william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself
a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign
these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those who were involved in creating the movie
examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history
typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the us in the last three months of the calendar year
the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded
the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies
this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues
despite the success of the dark knight the film did not receive a best picture nomination at the st academy awards
this decision received substantial criticism and was described as a snub by many publications
the backlash to the decision was such that for the nd academy awards awards in the academy increased the limit for best picture nominees from five to ten a change known as the dark knight rule
the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees
this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since which show that only of academy award nominees have been non white and since of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing
for a variety of reasons including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples a number of high profile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters
it took until for an asian woman to win an academy award for best actress when michelle yeoh received the award for her performance in everything everywhere all at once
the th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on activists perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias
in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by
some media critics claim the academys efforts to address its purported racial gender and national biases are merely distractions
by contrast the golden globe awards already have multiple winners of asian descent in leading actress categories
some question whether the academys definition of merit is just or empowering for non americans
the academys representation and inclusion standards have been criticized for excluding jews as a distinct underrepresented class
the academy has no rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either best actor actress or best supporting actor actress
this has led to situations where a film has two or more co leads and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other and to increase the films chances of winning
this practice has been derisively called category fraud
for example rooney mara was nominated for best supporting actress for carol despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to cate blanchett who was nominated for best actress
another example is once upon a time in hollywood where brad pitt was nominated for and won best supporting actor even though he played an equally important role to best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio
in both these cases critics argued that the weinstein company the studio behind the former film had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co lead
acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work
following the st academy awards in february in which the netflix broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services
spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than for typical oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than for other best picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an oscar
the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the academy in march cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the academy
following its april board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs
during the th academy awards on march chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head with a gi jane reference
will smith walked onstage and slapped rock across the face then returned to his seat and told rock twice to keep my wifes name out your fucking mouth while later accepting the best actor award for king richard smith apologized to the academy and the other nominees but not to rock
rock decided not to press charges against smith
on april the academy made an announcement via a letter sent by president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson informing the public that will smith had received a ten year ban from attending the oscars as a result of the incident
some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars
the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols
nichols boycotted the th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild
nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony
nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career
george c
scott became the second person to refuse his award at the rd academy awards ceremony
scott described it as a meat parade saying i dont want any part of it
the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award citing the film industrys discrimination against and mistreatment of native americans
at the th academy awards ceremony brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a page speech in his place detailing his criticisms for which there was booing and cheering by the audience
in littlefeather was accused by her sisters of misrepresenting her ancestry as native american
at the th academy awards in the award for the best animated feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed disney princess characters in live action remakes of their respective animated films lily james naomi scott and halle bailey was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast
the winner for the best animated short award was the windshield wiper a multilingual spanish american film which is adult animated while another nominee in three categories best animated feature best documentary feature film and best international feature film was flee a pg rated animated documentary about an afghan refugee
alberto mielgo director of the windshield wiper later gave an acceptance speech for the oscar animation is an art that includes every single art that you can imagine
animation for adults is a fact
its happening
lets call it cinema
im very honored because this is just the beginning of what we can do with animation
some speculations suggested that the speech played a role in the decision not to broadcast the award
another factor is that numerous animated films have been made for mature audiences or with ranges of pg or more with a few of them the triplets of belleville persepolis chico and rita the wind rises anomalisa my life as a courgette the breadwinner loving vincent isle of dogs i lost my body and flee having been nominated in this category with the boy and the heron being the first adult animated film to win in the th academy awards
these comments came as newdealanimation a movement of animation workers demanding equal pay treatment and recognition alongside their contemporaries working in live action was picking up momentum during negotiations for a new contract between the animation guild iatse local sag aftra and the alliance of motion picture and television producers and the presentation is being used to rally the movement
during the th academy awards in host jimmy kimmel said please raise your hand if you let your kid fill out this part of the ballot
these remarks would again prompt backlash with christopher miller producer of that years nominated tweeting out that the joke was tired and lazy
the pg rated the boy and the heron would subsequently win the award
it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars
in recent years these gifts have been extended to award nominees and winners
the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars
in the value was reported to be as high as us
the value has risen to the point where the us internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status
oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant videophones a four night stay at a hotel watches bracelets spa treatments bottles of vodka maple salad dressing weight loss gummie candy and up to worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from new york city facial plastic surgeon konstantin vasyukevich
some of the gifts have even had a risque element to them in the adult products retailer adam eve had a secret room gifting suite
celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag carolyn hennesy kate linder chris mulkey jim oheir and john salley
from onwards results are livesd all previous years are live viewing
actresses is a catalan language spanish drama film produced and directed by ventura pons and based on the award winning stage play er by josep maria benet i jornet
the film has no male actors with all roles played by females
the film was produced in
in order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress empar ribera young actress interviews three established actresses who had been the riberas pupils the international diva glria marc the television star assumpta roca and dubbing director maria caminal
actrius screened in at the graumans egyptian theatre in an american cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director
the film had first screened at the same location in
it was also shown at the stockholm international film festival
in movie film review christopher tookey wrote that though the actresses were competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers the film is visually unimaginative never escapes its stage origins and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident
noting that there were occasional refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness they did not justify comparisons to all about eve and were insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with rashomon
he also wrote that the guardian called the film a slow stuffy chamber piece and that the evening standard stated the films best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesomes composed veneers
mrqe wrote this cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story
animalia is an illustrated childrens book by graeme base

international atomic time is a high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid
tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide
it is a continuous scale of time without leap seconds and it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time
it is the basis for coordinated universal time which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earths surface and which has leap seconds
utc deviates from tai by a number of whole seconds
when another leap second was put into effect utc is currently exactly seconds behind tai
the seconds result from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since
tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth
specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used
tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due primarily to the slowing rotation of the earth
tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide
the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units definition of the second is based on caesium
the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer
due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock
the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai
time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds
these time scales are denoted in the form utc in the utc form where npl here identifies the national physical laboratory uk
the tai form may be denoted tai
the latter is not to be confused with ta which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else
the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other
the international bureau of weights and measures combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible
this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical tai
this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc for each participating institution k
the same circular also gives tables of tai ta for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales
errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t
aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised
in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale
since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time
early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk
it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale called greenwich atomic
the united states naval observatory began the a scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october
the international time bureau began a time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals
the bih scale a and nbs a were defined by an epoch at the beginning of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a in and ta in
the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in
from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions that designated the bipm time scale international atomic time
in the s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks
starting from the julian date corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid
because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion
the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal
the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time geocentric coordinate time and terrestrial time which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system
all three of these time scales were defined to read jd exactly at that instant
tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai s
the continued existence of tai was questioned in a letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc
contrary to tai utc is a discontinuous time scale
it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds
between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time by a constant offset
from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut
afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut
this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale
the less frequent whole second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally
the fact that it continues to approximate ut means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc
altruism is the principle and practice of concern for the well being and or happiness of other humans or animals above oneself
while objects of altruistic concern vary it is an important moral value in many cultures and religions
it may be considered a synonym of selflessness the opposite of selfishness
the word altruism was popularized by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as for an antonym of egoism
he derived it from the italian which in turn was derived from latin meaning other people or somebody else
altruism as observed in populations of organisms is when an individual performs an action at a cost to itself that benefits directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action
altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good
the latter are predicated upon social relationships whilst altruism does not consider relationships
whether true altruism is possible in human psychology is a subject of debate
the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification
the validity of this argument depends on whether such qualify as benefits
the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others
used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first
effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
the concept of altruism has a history in philosophical and ethical thought
the term was coined in the th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists evolutionary biologists and ethologists
whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism
in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them above oneself
marcel mausss essay the gift contains a passage called note on alms
this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms from the notion of sacrifice
in it he writes in the science of ethology and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor
in evolutionary psychology this term may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism
theories of apparently altruistic behavior were by the need to produce ideas compatible with evolutionary origins
two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioral strategies
such explanations do not imply that humans consciously calculate how to increase their inclusive fitness when doing altruistic acts
instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote certain altruistic behaviors
the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups
research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than competitors and to members in groups than to members of out groups
the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r
prices development of the price equation a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution
an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides
these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body
selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success
such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics for example by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his book and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left
jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs dor hospital network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging
in their research they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex
however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region
these structures social attachment and bonding in other species
the experiment suggested that altruism is not a higher moral faculty overpowering innate selfish desires but a fundamental ingrained and enjoyable trait in the brain
one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex basal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in people with empathy
the same study identified giving to charity and of social bonding
bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist in an fmri scanner test conducted with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions as jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists
one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in charity such as a persons environment and values
a recent meta analysis of fmri studies conducted by shawn rhoads jo cutler and abigail marsh analyzed the results of prior studies of generosity in which participants could freely choose to give or not give resources to someone else
the results of this study confirmed that altruism is supported by distinct mechanisms from giving motivated by reciprocity or by fairness
this study also confirmed that the right ventral striatum is recruited during altruistic giving as well as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula which are regions previously implicated in empathy
abigail marsh has conducted studies of real world altruists that have also identified an important role for the amygdala in human altruism
in real world altruists such as people who have donated kidneys to strangers the amygdala is larger than in typical adults
altruists amygdalas are also more responsive than those of typical adults to the sight of others distress which is thought to reflect an empathic response to distress
this structure may also be involved in altruistic choices due to its role in encoding the value of outcomes for others
this is consistent with the findings of research in non human animals which has identified neurons within the amygdala that specifically encode the value of others outcomes activity in which appears to drive altruistic choices in monkeys
the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state to increase anothers welfare
psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase ones welfare
in keeping with this research in real world altruists including altruistic kidney donors bone marrow donors humanitarian aid workers and heroic rescuers findings that these altruists are primarily distinguished from other adults by unselfish traits and decision making patterns
this suggests that human altruism reflects genuinely high valuation of others outcomes
there has been some debate on whether humans are capable of psychological altruism
some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors
however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is difficult to prove
the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when the benefits outweigh the costs to the self
daniel batson a psychologist examined this question and argued against the social exchange theory
he identified four significant motives to ultimately benefit the self to ultimately benefit the other person to benefit a group or to uphold a moral principle
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless
the empathy altruism hypothesis states that psychological altruism exists and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone suffering
feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with personal distress which compels people to reduce their unpleasant emotions and increase their positive ones by helping someone in need
empathy is thus not selfless since altruism works either as a way to avoid those negative unpleasant feelings and have positive pleasant feelings when triggered by others need for help or as a way to gain social reward or avoid social punishment by helping
people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid allowing it unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering
helping behavior is seen in humans from about two years old when a toddler can understand subtle emotional cues
in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service
people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress
the number of bystanders witnessing pain or suffering affects the likelihood of helping
more significant numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility
however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders
many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well being
in a study of older adults those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live and less depression anxiety and somatization
volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages
one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over years and found that of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one
a study on adults aged and older found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a lower likelihood of dying
after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a reduction in mortality
merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being
a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness
happier people are kinder and more grateful kinder people are happier and more grateful and more grateful people are happier and kinder the study suggests
while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder
the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional
studies found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states
feeling over taxed by the needs of others has negative effects on health and happiness
for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one
both genetics and environment have been implicated in influencing pro social or altruistic behavior
candidate genes include oxtr cd comt drd drd igf avpra and gabrb
it is theorized that some of these genes influence altruistic behavior by modulating levels of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine
sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society
the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a commonly researched topic within the field
the american sociology association acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable
this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid popular and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies
how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society
the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study for example one study links the occurrence of moral outrage to altruistic compensation of victims
studies show that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate the generosity they observe in others
most if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value
buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc
place particular emphasis on altruistic morality
altruism figures prominently in buddhism
love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering
many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion
these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being
the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes the practitioners own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes
in buddhism a persons actions cause karma which consists of consequences proportional to the moral implications of their actions
deeds considered to be bad are punished while those considered to be good are rewarded
the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings
jainism preaches to live and let live not harming sentient beings ie uncompromising reverence for all life
it also considers all living things to be equal
the first rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things
the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul
jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become
because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in ones actions
jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small
this policy extends even to microscopic organisms
jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders
thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others
considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship he quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves
aquinas concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part
however he thought we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being
in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism
the aim and focus of christian life is a life that glorifies god with obeying christs command to treat others equally caring for them and understanding eternity in heaven is what jesus resurrection at calvary was all about
many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god
states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god
thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love
an altruistic action is not always a loving action
oord defines altruism as acting for the others good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall well being
german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak
one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence
another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love
nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business
at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc
directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse
in the arabic language means preferring others to oneself
on the topic of donating blood to non muslims the shia religious professor fadhil al milani has provided theological evidence that makes it positively justifiable
in fact he considers it a form of religious sacrifice and ithar
for sufis iythar means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by god on the human body considered to be property of god alone
the importance of iythar lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing as abiding by the highest degree of nobility
this is similar to the notion of chivalry
a constant concern for god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world
judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation
rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity
love is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism
this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god
kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence
rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this force of giving
modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework
ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another
ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity
altruism is essential to the sikh religion
the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed anyone can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony and truthfulness
or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism
the fifth guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth
the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity
in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy
he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield
some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy
sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield
what were you doing and why asked the guru
i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya
the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds
you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru
under the tutelage of the guru bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service
in hinduism selflessness love kindness and forgiveness are considered as the highest acts of humanity or
giving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or and will led them to heaven or in afterlife
altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs
mass donation of clothes to poor people or blood donation camp or mass food donation for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies
the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga nishkam karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism
altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and are central to hindu morality
there is a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically
proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically
the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest
both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants
a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible
rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones self interest
effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values
it is the broad evidence based and cause neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity
effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence based practices
while a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or otherwise have the biggest benefit
people associated with the movement include philosopher peter singer facebook co founder dustin moskovitz cari tuna oxford based researchers william macaskill and toby ord and professional poker player liv boeree
pathological altruism is altruism taken to an unhealthy extreme such that it either harms the altruistic person or the persons well intentioned actions cause more harm than good
the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism
examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid
extreme altruism also known as costly altruism extraordinary altruism or heroic behaviours refers to selfless acts directed to a stranger which significantly exceed the normal altruistic behaviours often involving risks or great cost to the altruists themselves
since acts of extreme altruism are often directed towards strangers many commonly accepted models of simple altruism appear inadequate in explaining this phenomenon
one of the initial concepts was introduced by wilson in which he referred to as hard core altruism
this form is characterised by impulsive actions directed towards others typically a stranger and lacking incentives for reward
since then several papers have mentioned the possibility of such altruism
the current slow progress in the field is due to general ethical guidelines that restrict exposing research participants to costly or risky decisions
consequently much research has based their studies on living organ donations and the actions of carnegie hero medal recipients actions which involve high risk high cost and are of infrequent occurrences
a typical example of extreme altruism would be non directed kidney donation a living person donating one of their kidneys to a stranger without any benefits or knowing the recipient
however current research can only be carried out on a small population that meets the requirements of extreme altruism
most of the time the research is also via the form of self report which could lead to self report biases
due to the limitations the current gap between high stakes and normal altruism remains unknown
in schwartz hypothesised that extreme altruism is positively related to a persons moral norms and is not influenced by the cost associated with the action
this hypothesis was supported in the same study examining bone marrow donors
schwartz discovered that individuals with strong personal norms and those who attribute more responsibility to themselves are more inclined to participate in bone marrow donation
similar findings were observed in a study by piliavin and libby focusing on blood donors
these studies suggest that personal norms lead to the activation of moral norms leading individuals to feel compelled to help others
abigail marsh has described psychopaths as the opposite group of people to extreme altruists and has conducted a few research comparing these two groups of individuals
utilising techniques such as brain imaging and behavioural experiments marshs team observed that kidney donors tend to have larger amygdala sizes and exhibit better abilities in recognizing fearful expressions compared to psychopathic individuals
furthermore an improved ability to recognize fear has been associated with an increase in prosocial behaviours including greater charity contribution
rand and epstein explored the behaviours of carnegie hero medal recipients demonstrating how extreme altruistic behaviours often stem from system i of the dual process theory which leads to rapid and intuitive behaviours
additionally a separate by carlson et al
indicated that such prosocial behaviours are prevalent in emergencies where immediate actions are required
this discovery has led to ethical debates particularly in the context of living organ donation where laws regarding this issue differ by country
as observed in extreme altruists these decisions are made intuitively which may reflect insufficient consideration
critics are concerned about whether this rapid decision encompasses a thorough cost benefit analysis and question the appropriateness of exposing donors to such risk
one finding suggests how extreme altruists exhibit lower levels of social discounting as compared to others
with that meaning extreme altruists place a higher value on the welfare of strangers than a typical person does
analysis of carnegie hero award recipients and another study on rescuing acts reveal that a significant proportion of rescuers come from lower socio economic backgrounds
johnson attributes the distribution to the high risk occupations that are more prevalent between lower socioeconomic groups
another hypothesis proposed by lyons is that individuals from these groups may perceive they have less to lose when engaging in high risk extreme altruistic behaviours
evolutionary theories such as the kin selection reciprocity vested interest and punishment either contradict or do not fully explain the concept of extreme altruism
as a result considerable research has attempted for a separate explanation for this behaviour
research suggests that males are more likely to engage in heroic and risk taking behaviours due to a preference among females for such traits
these extreme altruistic behaviours could serve to act as an unconscious signal to showcase superior power and ability compared to ordinary individuals
when an extreme altruist survives a high risk situation they send an honest signal of quality
three qualities hypothesized to be exhibited by extreme altruists which could be interpreted as signals are traits that are difficult to fake a willingness to help and generous behaviours
the empathy altruism hypothesis appears to align with the concept of extreme altruism without contradiction
the hypothesis was supported with further brain scanning research which indicates how this group of people demonstrate a higher level of empathy concern
the level of empathy concern then triggers activation in specific brain regions urging the individual to engage in heroic behaviours
while most altruistic behaviours offer some form of benefit extreme altruism may sometimes result from a mistake where the victim does not reciprocate
considering the impulsive characteristic of extreme altruists some researchers suggest that these individuals have made a wrong judgement during the cost benefit analysis
furthermore extreme altruism might be a rare variation of altruism where they lie towards to ends of a normal distribution
in the us the annual prevalence rate per capita is less than this shows the rarity of such behaviours
digital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of reciprocity and in the belief that in the end everyone benefits from sharing information via the internet
there are three types of digital altruism everyday digital altruism involving expedience ease moral engagement and conformity creative digital altruism involving creativity heightened moral engagement and cooperation and co creative digital altruism involving creativity moral engagement and meta cooperative efforts
alice oconnor better known by her pen name ayn rand was a russian born american author and philosopher
she is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named objectivism
born and educated in russia she moved to the united states in
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two broadway plays rand achieved fame with her novel the fountainhead
in she published her best selling work the novel atlas shrugged
afterward until her death in she turned to non fiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays
rand advocated reason and rejected faith and religion
she supported rational and ethical egoism as opposed to altruism
in politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and supported laissez faire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights including private property rights
although she opposed libertarianism which she viewed as anarchism rand is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the united states
in art she promoted romantic realism
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her with a few exceptions
rands books have sold over million copies
her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics with reviews becoming more negative for her later work
although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected rands philosophy arguing that she has a polemical approach and that her work lacks methodological rigor
her writings have politically influenced some right libertarians and conservatives
the objectivist movement circulates her ideas both to the public and in academic settings
rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february into a jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg in what was then the russian empire
she was the eldest of three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum a pharmacist and anna borisovna
she was when the october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted her familys lives
her fathers pharmacy was nationalized and the family fled to yevpatoria in crimea which was initially under the control of the white army during the russian civil war
after graduating high school there in june she returned with her family to petrograd where they faced desperate conditions occasionally nearly starving
when russian universities were opened to women after the revolution rand was among the first to enroll at petrograd state university
at she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history
she was one of many bourgeois students purged from the university shortly before graduating
after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many purged students including rand were reinstated
she graduated from the renamed leningrad state university in october
she then studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad
for an assignment rand wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri it became her first published work
she decided her professional surname for writing would be rand and she adopted the first name ayn
in late rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in chicago
she arrived in new york city on february
intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with her relatives learning english before moving to hollywood california
in hollywood a chance meeting with director cecil b
demille led to work as an extra in his film the king of kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter
while working on the king of kings she met the aspiring actor frank oconnor they married on april
she became a permanent american resident in july and an american citizen on march
she tried to bring her parents and sisters to the united states but they could not obtain permission to emigrate
rands first literary success was the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in although it was never produced
her courtroom drama night of january th first staged in hollywood in reopened successfully on broadway in
each night a jury was selected from members of the audience based on its vote one of two different endings would be performed
rand and oconnor moved to new york city in december so she could handle revisions for the broadway production
her first novel the semi autobiographical we the living was published in
set in soviet russia it focuses on the struggle between the individual and the state
initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell
she adapted the story as a stage play but the broadway production closed in less than a week
after the success of her later novels rand released a revised version in that has sold over three million copies
rand started her next major novel the fountainhead in december but took a break from it in to write her novella anthem
the novella presents a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we
protagonists equality and liberty eventually escape the collectivistic society and rediscover the word i
it was published in england in but rand could not find an american publisher at that time
as with we the living rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in and this sold over million copies
during the s rand became politically active
she and her husband were full time volunteers for republican wendell willkies presidential campaign
this work put her in contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism
she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt who introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises
despite philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men and they expressed admiration for her
mises once called her the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman
rand became friends with libertarian writer isabel paterson
rand questioned her about american history and politics during their many meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only non fiction book the god of the machine
rands first major success as a writer came in with the fountainhead a novel about an uncompromising architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as second handers who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves
twelve publishers rejected it before bobbs merrill company accepted it at the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it
while completing the novel rand was prescribed benzedrine an amphetamine to fight fatigue
the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest
her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to mood swings and outbursts described by some of her later associates
the success of the fountainhead brought rand fame and financial security
in she sold the film rights to warner bros
and returned to hollywood to write the screenplay
producer hal b
wallis then hired her as a screenwriter and script doctor for screenplays including love letters and you came along
rand became involved with the anti communist motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals and american writers association
in during the second red scare she testified as a friendly witness before the united states house un american activities committee that the film song of russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as much better and happier than it was
she also wanted to criticize the lauded film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so
when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations effectiveness rand described the process as futile
after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in
although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing the acting and other elements
following the publication of the fountainhead rand received many letters from readers some of whom the book had influenced profoundly
in rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers who met at rands apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy
the group included future chair of the federal reserve alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal and his wife barbara and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff
later rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged
in her close relationship with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair
this change occurred with the knowledge of both their spouses although historian jennifer burns concludes that her husband frank oconnor was likely the hardest hit emotionally by the affair
published in atlas shrugged is considered rands magnum opus
she described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest
it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement
the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy
the novels hero and leader of the strike john galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements
the novel contains an exposition of objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by galt
despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed rand
atlas shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher
in nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute to promote rands philosophy through public lectures
he and rand co founded the objectivist newsletter in to circulate articles about her ideas she later republished some of these articles in book form
rand was unimpressed by many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her
critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later said the nbi culture was one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand
some described the nbi or the objectivist movement as a cult or religion
rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair
some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers
some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new york
throughout the s and s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through nonfiction and speeches including annual lectures at the ford hall forum
in answers to audience questions she took controversial stances on political and social issues
these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft supporting israel in the yom kippur war of against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages claiming european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting despite advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it
she endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in
in nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married
nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand
as her relationship with nathaniel branden deteriorated rand had her husband be present for difficult conversations between her and branden
in rand learned about brandens relationship with scott
though her romantic involvement with nathaniel branden was already over rand ended her relationship with both brandens and the nbi closed
she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and irrational behavior in his private life
in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company
rand had surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking
in she retired from her newsletter and despite her lifelong objections to any government run program was enrolled in and subsequently claimed social security and medicare government assistance with the aid of a social worker
her activities in the objectivist movement declined especially after her husband died on november
one of her final projects was a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged
on march rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city
her funeral included a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign
in her will rand named peikoff as her heir
rand described her approach to literature as romantic realism
she wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was
this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters
her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive
her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals
rand often describes them as unattractive and some have names that suggest negative traits such as wesley mouch in atlas shrugged
rand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer anne heller described as tight elaborate fast paced plotting
romantic triangles are a common plot element in rands fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two men
in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her favorites
she considered them to be among the top rank of romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots
hugo was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting
in the introduction she wrote for an english language edition of his novel ninety three rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature
although rand disliked most russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and other nineteenth century russian writing most notably the novel what is to be done by nikolay chernyshevsky
scholars of russian literature see in chernyshevskys character rakhmetov an ascetic revolutionist the template for rands literary heroes and heroines
rands experience of the russian revolution and early communist russia influenced the portrayal of her villains
beyond we the living which is set in russia this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of ellsworth toohey in the fountainhead and in the destruction of the economy in atlas shrugged
rands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios
they often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close up details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective
the first reviews rand received were for night of january th
reviews of the broadway production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer
although rand believed that we the living was not widely reviewed over publications published approximately different reviews
overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work
anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues
rands first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed
lorine pruettes positive review in the new york times which called the author a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly was one that rand greatly appreciated
there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications
some negative reviews said the novel was too long others called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian
atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative
atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity
whittaker chambers wrote what was later called the novels most notorious review for the conservative magazine national review
he accused rand of supporting a godless system claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard
commanding to a gas chamber go
rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels
the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged
philosopher sidney hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality
these reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics
her subsequent books got progressively less review attention
academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was limited
mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the s
since her death scholars of english and american literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the s
several academic book series about important authors cover rand and her works as do popular study guides like cliffsnotes and sparknotes
in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation
in lisa duggan described rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers despite being easy to criticize for her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots her rigid moralizing her middle to lowbrow aesthetic preferences
and philosophical strivings
rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute
she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics aesthetics and political philosophy
in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion
rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism
in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value judgments
according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness
as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature
in works such as the romantic manifesto and she described romanticism the approach that most accurately reflects the existence of human free will
in epistemology rand considered all knowledge to be based on forming higher levels of understanding from sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic
she described reason as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses
rand rejected all claims of non perceptual knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing
in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy
she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy
commentators including hazel barnes nathaniel branden and albert ellis have criticized rands focus on the importance of reason
barnes and ellis said rand was too dismissive of emotion and failed to recognize its importance in human life
branden said rands emphasis on reason led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be
in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism as the guiding moral principle
she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself
rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title
in it she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man which requires the use of a rational mind
she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites
rands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy
several authors including robert nozick and william f
oneill in two of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the is ought problem
critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage
critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism
rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights
she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights
rand opposed collectivism and statism which she considered to include many specific forms of government such as communism fascism socialism theocracy and the welfare state
her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights
although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian rand preferred the term radical for capitalism
she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics
rand rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice and denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism
several critics including nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails
others like libertarian philosopher michael huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions
some critics like roy childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government
except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her
acknowledging aristotle as her greatest influence rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three as aristotle aquinas and ayn rand
in a interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me
in an article for the claremont review of books political scientist charles murray criticized rands claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle
he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche
rand took early inspiration from nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in rands private journals
in she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer william edward hickman
there are other indications of nietzsches influence in passages from the first edition of we the living and in her overall writing style
by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsches ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed
rands views also may have been influenced by the promotion of egoism among the russian nihilists including chernyshevsky and dmitry pisarev although there is no direct evidence that she read them
rand considered immanuel kant her philosophical opposite and the most evil man in mankinds history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self interest
philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences
she was also critical of plato and viewed his differences with aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy
rands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic
she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse
she was dismissive of critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in depth analysis
academic philosophers in turn viewed her negatively and dismissed her as an unimportant figure who should not be considered a philosopher or given any serious response
during rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars
in john hospers discussed rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook an introduction to philosophical analysis
that same year hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics
when the first full length academic book about rands philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously
a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in the personalist
one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who criticized her meta ethical arguments
in the same journal other philosophers argued that nozick misstated rands case
in an article responding to nozick douglas den uyl and douglas b
rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional
after her death interest in rands ideas increased gradually
the philosophic thought of ayn rand a collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen was the first academic book about rands ideas published after her death
in one essay political writer jack wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought
in the ayn rand society was founded as an affiliate of the american philosophical association
in a entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers jenny a
heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand
she said that rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy
yet throughout literary academia ayn rand is considered a philosopher
writing in the edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts
he said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of aristotles ethics and her political theory is of little interest because it is marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism
the journal of ayn rand studies a multidisciplinary peer reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas was established in
in historian jennifer burns identified an explosion of scholarship about rand since although as of that year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area
from to over colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of bbt that required teaching rands ideas or works in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about rand
in a essay for the cato institute huemer argued very few people find rands ideas convincing especially her ethics
he attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist
in the pennsylvania state university press agreed to take over publication of the journal of ayn rand studies and the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the societys proceedings
the fall update to the entry about rand in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously
that same year political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as the traditional academic view of rand
in a article for aeon philosopher skye c
cleary wrote philosophers love to hate ayn rand
its trendy to scoff at any mention of her
however cleary said that because many people take rands ideas seriously philosophers need to treat the ayn rand phenomenon seriously and provide refutations rather than ignoring her
in media critic eric burns said rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher
that same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more were engaging with her work in recent years
with over million copies sold rands books continue to be read widely
a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club in asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives
rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible
although rands influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work
rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like ira levin kay nolte smith and l
neil smith she has influenced later writers like erika holzer terry goodkind and comic book artist steve ditko
rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work
businessmen such as john allison of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands ideas
television shows movies songs and video games have referred to rand and her works
throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines as well as book length critiques by authors such as the psychologist albert ellis and trinity foundation president john w
rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by american authors including kay nolte smith mary gaitskill matt ruff and tobias wolff
nick gillespie former editor in chief of reason remarked rands is a tortured immortality one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist
jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture
two movies have been made about rands life
a documentary film was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature
the passion of ayn rand a television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards
rands image also appears on a us postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano
rands works most commonly anthem or the fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading
since the ayn rand institute has provided free copies of rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum
the institute had distributed million copies in the us and canada by the end of
in rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom
although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had a continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism
rand is often considered one of the three most important women in the early development of modern american libertarianism
david nolan one founder of the libertarian party said that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist
in his history of that movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large
political scientist andrew koppelman called her the most widely read libertarian
historian jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right
the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives despite rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being pro choice and an atheist
she faced intense opposition from william f
buckley jr and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas
nevertheless a article in the new york times called her the reagan administrations novelist laureate
republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels
she has influenced some conservative politicians outside the us such as sajid javid in the united kingdom siv jensen in norway and ayelet shaked in israel
the financial crisis of renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis
opinion articles compared real world events with the novels plot
signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests
there was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left
critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan
in adam weiner said that through greenspan rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy
lisa duggan said that rands novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas
in cass sunstein said rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of rands fiction
after the closure of the nathaniel branden institute the objectivist movement continued in other forms
in the s peikoff began delivering courses on objectivism
in peter schwartz started a newsletter called the intellectual activist which rand endorsed
she also endorsed the objectivist forum a bimonthly magazine founded by objectivist philosopher harry binswanger which ran from to
in peikoff worked with businessman ed snider to establish the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works
in after an ideological disagreement with peikoff david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society
in historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia

it is bordered to the northeast by tunisia to the east by libya to the southeast by niger to the southwest by mali mauritania and western sahara to the west by morocco and to the north by the mediterranean sea
algeria has a semi arid climate with the sahara desert dominating most of the territory except for its fertile and mountainous north where most of the population is concentrated
spanning it is the worlds tenth largest nation by area and the largest nation in africa
with a population of million algeria is the tenth most populous country in africa and the nd most populous country in the world
the capital and largest city is algiers located in the far north on the mediterranean coast
inhabited since prehistory algeria has been at the crossroads of numerous cultures and civilizations including the phoenicians romans vandals byzantine greeks and turks
its modern identity is rooted in centuries of arab muslim migration waves since the seventh century and the subsequent arabization of the berber population
following a succession of islamic arab and berber dynasties between the eighth and th centuries the regency of algiers was established in as a largely independent tributary state of the ottoman empire ruling over much of the countrys present day northern territory
after nearly three centuries as a major power in the mediterranean the country was invaded by france in and formally annexed in though it was not fully conquered and pacified until
french rule brought mass european settlement that displaced the local population which was reduced by up to one third due to warfare disease and starvation
the stif and guelma massacre in catalysed local resistance that culminated in the outbreak of the algerian war in
algeria gained its independence on july and declared the peoples democratic republic on september of that year
the country descended into a bloody civil war from to
algerias official languages are arabic and tamazight french is used in media education and certain administrative matters
the vast majority of the population speak the algerian dialect of arabic
most algerians are arabs with berbers forming a sizeable minority
sunni islam is the official religion and practised by percent of the population
algeria is a semi presidential republic composed of provinces and communes
it is a regional power in north africa and a middle power in global affairs
the country has the second highest human development index in continental africa and one of the largest economies in africa due mostly to its large petroleum and natural gas reserves which are the sixteenth and ninth largest in the world respectively
sonatrach the national oil company is the largest company in africa and a major supplier of natural gas to europe
the algerian military is one of the largest in africa with the highest defence budget on the continent and among the highest in the world
algeria is a member of the african union the arab league the oic opec the united nations and the arab maghreb union of which it is a founding member
other forms of the name are
it is officially the peoples democratic republic of algeria
algerias name derives from the city of algiers which in turn derives from the arabic referring to four small islands off its coast a truncated form of the older
the name was given by buluggin ibn ziri after he established the city on the ruins of the phoenician city of icosium in
it was employed by medieval geographers such as muhammad al idrisi and yaqut al hamawi
algeria took its name from the regency of algeria or regency of algiers when ottoman rule was established in the central maghreb in early th century
this period saw the installation of a political and administrative organization which participated in the establishment of the algerian and the definition of its borders with its neighboring entities on the east and west
the ottoman turks who settled in algeria referred both to themselves and the peoples as algerians
acting as a central military and political authority in the regency the ottoman turks shaped the modern political identity of algeria as a state possessing all the attributes of sovereign independence despite still being nominally subject to the ottoman sultan
algerian nationalist historian and statesman ahmed tewfik el madani regarded the regency as the first algerian state and the algerian ottoman republic
around million year old stone artifacts from ain hanech were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa
stone artifacts and cut marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be million years old and even older stone artifacts to be as old as million years
hence the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought
the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multiple origin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa
neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles similar to those in the levant
algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques
tools of this era starting about bc are called aterian
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian
this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between and bc
neolithic civilization developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as bc or as late as between and bc
this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period
the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa
from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius and rusicade
these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages
as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically
berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states
trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others
by the early th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army
in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from to bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war
they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa
the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars
in bc the city of carthage was destroyed
as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew
by the nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged
two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage
west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean
the high point of berber civilisation unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the nd century bc
after masinissas death in bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times
masinissas line survived until ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region
algeria is home to the second largest number of roman sites and remains after italy
rome after getting rid of its powerful rival carthage in the year bc decided a century later to include numidia to become the new master of north africa
they built more than cities
like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products
saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius located in the roman province of africa
the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in and by controlled coastal numidia
they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes
in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival
furthermore during the rule of the romans byzantines vandals carthaginians and ottomans the berber people were the only or one of the few in north africa who remained independent
the berber people were so resistant that even during the muslim conquest of north africa they still had control and possession over their mountains
the collapse of the western roman empire led to the establishment of a native kingdom based in altava known as the mauro roman kingdom
it was succeeded by another kingdom based in altava the kingdom of altava
during the reign of kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern day fez in the west to the western aurs and later kairaouan and the interior of ifriqiya in the east
after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early th century
large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam
christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the th century and muslims only became a vast majority some time in the th
after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the zayyanids
the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the th century and the th
the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the th century
during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mumin and yghmrasen
it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb
these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo
the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded
to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them
the resultant war is recounted in the epic tghribt
in al tghrbt the amazigh zirid hero khlf al znat asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero bu zayd al hilal and many other arab knights in a string of victories
the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture
the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it
the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen
caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era
the berber people historically consisted of several tribes
the two main branches were the botr and barns tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes
each region of the maghreb contained several tribes
all these tribes made independent territorial decisions
several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands
ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid ifranid maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties
both of the hammadid and zirid empires as well as the fatimids established their rule in all of the maghreb countries
the zirids ruled land in what is now algeria tunisia morocco libya spain malta and italy
the hammadids captured and held important regions such as ouargla constantine sfax susa algiers tripoli and fez establishing their rule in every country in the maghreb region
the fatimids which was created and established by the kutama berbers conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east
following the berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the maghreb
in algeria the rustamid kingdom was established
the rustamid realm stretched from tafilalt in morocco to the nafusa mountains in libya including south central and western tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day maghreb countries in the south the rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of mali and included territory in mauritania
once extending their control over all of the maghreb part of spain and briefly over sicily originating from modern algeria the zirids only controlled modern ifriqiya by the th century
the zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of the fatimid caliphs of cairo
el muizz the zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence
the zirids also fought against other zenata kingdoms for example the maghrawa a berber dynasty originating from algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the maghreb ruling over much of morocco and western algeria including fez sijilmasa aghmat oujda most of the sous and draa and reaching as far as msila and the zab in algeria
as the fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion they found another means of revenge
between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin nomad tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulency
the banu hilal and the banu sulaym for example who regularly disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot their farms
the then fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he could not control and broke a deal with the chiefs of these bedouin tribes
the fatimids even gave them money to leave
whole tribes set off with women children elders animals and camping equipment
some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region arriving
the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the battlefield
the arabs usually did not take control over the cities instead looting them and destroying them
the invasion kept going and in the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they encircled the qalaa of banu hammad as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago
from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains
some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the almohads in the second half of the th century
the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant
ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert
the almohads originating from modern day morocco although founded by a man originating from modern day algeria known as abd al mumin would soon take control over the maghreb
during the time of the almohad dynasty abd al mumins tribe the kouma were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire
defeating the weakening almoravid empire and taking control over morocco in they pushed into algeria in taking control over tlemcen oran and algiers wrestling control from the hilian arabs and by the same year they defeated hammadids who controlled eastern algeria
following their decisive defeat in the battle of las navas de tolosa in the almohads began collapsing and in the governor of modern day western algeria yaghmurasen ibn zyan declared his independence and established the kingdom of tlemcen and the zayyanid dynasty
warring with the almohad forces attempting to restore control over algeria for years they defeated the almohads in after killing their caliph in a successful ambush near oujda
the zayyanids retained their control over algeria for centuries
much of the eastern territories of algeria were under the authority of the hafsid dynasty although the emirate of bejaia encompassing the algerian territories of the hafsids would occasionally be independent from central tunisian control
at their peak the zayyanid kingdom included all of morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as tunis which they captured during the reign of abu tashfin
after several conflicts with local barbary pirates sponsored by the zayyanid sultans spain decided to invade algeria and defeat the native kingdom of tlemcen
in they invaded and captured mers el kbir and in after a bloody siege they conquered oran
following their decisive victories over the algerians in the western coastal areas of algeria the spanish decided to get bolder and invaded more algerian cities
in they led a series of sieges and attacks taking over bejaia in a large siege and leading a semi successful siege against algiers
they also besieged tlemcen
in they took control over cherchell and jijel and attacked mostaganem where although they were not able to conquer the city they were able to force a tribute on them
in the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers
they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim al tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions
their state is known as the regency of algiers
when aruj was killed in during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers
the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some janissaries
with the aid of this force and native algerians hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran
the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan who assumed the position in
he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins as his mother was an algerian mooresse
until beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits
subsequently with the institution of a regular administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms
the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha
discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha
as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in
plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa
algiers lost between and inhabitants to the plague in and had high fatalities in and
the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea
the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves
they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives
according to robert davis from the th to th century pirates captured million to million europeans as slaves
they often made raids on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire
in for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population
in the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo
barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands
the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera
the introduction of broad sail ships from the beginning of the th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic
in july two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves
two weeks earlier another pirate ship from sal in morocco had also raided in iceland
some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria
in pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands
in the janissaries stationed in algiers also known commonly as the odjak of algiers and the reis or the company of corsair captains rebelled they removed the ottoman viceroy from power and placed one of its own in power
the new leader received the title of agha then dey in and the right to select passed to the divan a council of some sixty military senior officers
thus algiers became a sovereign military republic
it was at first dominated by the odjak but by the th century it had become the deys instrument
although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire in reality they acted independently from the rest of the empire and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis
the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat
the dey was elected for a life term but in the years that the system was in place fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated
despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly
although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest
autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylia although in the regency was able to take control over the kingdom of kuku in western kabylia
many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys
barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish empire launched an invasion in then the spanish navy bombarded algiers in and
for the attack in the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta
over cannonballs were fired but all these military campaigns were doomed and spain had to ask for peace in and paid million pesos to the dey
in algiers took back oran and mers el kbir the two last spanish strongholds in algeria
in the same year they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda which they then abandoned in
in the th century algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels
attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars which ended the attacks on us ships in
a year later a combined anglo dutch fleet under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen
these efforts proved successful although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in
under the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in
according to several historians the methods used by the french to establish control over algeria reached genocidal proportions
historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by the french conquest was complete
the war had killed approximately indigenous algerians since
french losses from to were dead in the hospital and only killed in action
in the algerian population stood at about million
french policy was predicated on civilising the country
the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest
the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed
a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from to
on september napoleon iii declared our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million arabs whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination
during this time only kabylia resisted the kabylians were not colonized until after the mokrani revolt in
alexis de tocqueville wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform algeria from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime wherein he advocated for a mixed system of total domination and total colonization whereby french military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within french occupied cities
from until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and dpartement of the nation
one of frances longest held overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied noirs
between and french people emigrated to algeria
these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land
many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities
during the late th and early th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population
the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after
the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonized countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human capital intensive agriculture
during the second world war algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch which saw the first large scale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign

tensions between the two population groups came to a head in when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of november
historians have estimated that between and harkis and their dependents were killed by the national liberation front or by lynch mobs in algeria
the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals
in addition the french destroyed over villages and relocated over million algerians to concentration camps
the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries
historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence
horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around
the war uprooted more than million algerians
the war against french rule concluded in when algeria gained complete independence following the march evian agreements and the july self determination referendum
the number of european pied noirs who fled algeria totaled more than between and
the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians
algerias first president was the front de libration nationale leader ahmed ben bella
moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in
ben bella was overthrown in by houari boumdine his former ally and defence minister
under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumdienne continued this trend
however he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role

according to barbara branden who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written there were sections written describing danneskjlds adventures at sea cut from the final published text
in a comment at a lecture rand said that danneskjlds name was a tribute to victor hugos novel hans of iceland wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskjld
in the published book danneskjld is always seen through the eyes of others except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter

the following secondary characters also appear in the novel
anthropology is the scientific study of humanity concerned with human behavior human biology cultures societies and linguistics in both the present and past including archaic humans
social anthropology studies patterns of behavior while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values
the term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today
linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life
biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans
archaeology often termed as anthropology of the past studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence
it is considered a branch of anthropology in north america and asia while in europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history and palaeontology
the abstract noun is first attested in reference to history
its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann
their neo latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words nthrpos and lgos
its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle
it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early th century
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by tienne serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de brau
various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed
the socit ethnologique de paris the first to use the term ethnology was formed in and focused on methodically studying human races
after the death of its founder william frdric edwards in it gradually declined in activity until it eventually dissolved in
meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in a break away group of the aborigines protection society
these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists
they maintained international connections
anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier th century
theorists in diverse fields such as anatomy linguistics and ethnology started making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters and were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then
for them the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect
darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late s
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences
paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the socit de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the socit danthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in
when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism
his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature
broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech
he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech
he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called brocas area after him
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvlker
the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples
the last two volumes were published posthumously
waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man
following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him
he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation
the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison
it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men
waitz was influential among british ethnologists
in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology
it was the nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence
representatives from the french socit were present though not broca
in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard
among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist
previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist
similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the italian society of anthropology and ethnology and many others subsequently
the majority of these were evolutionists
one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists
not religious himself he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation
during the last three decades of the th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association
the major theorists belonged to these organizations
they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning
by educational institutions in countries had some curriculum in anthropology
none of the faculty members were under a department named anthropology
anthropology as a specialized field of academic study developed much through the end of the th century
then it rapidly expanded beginning in the early th century to the point where many of the worlds higher educational institutions typically included anthropology departments
thousands of anthropology departments have come into existence and anthropology has also diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more
practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene
the organization has also reached a global level
for example the world council of anthropological associations a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations
since the work of franz boas and bronisaw malinowski in the late th and early th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance they place on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research
cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques
this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against th century racial ideology through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism
ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork
in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate
in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology archaeological anthropology and linguistic anthropology
these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques
european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology
it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc
early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by al biruni of the islamic golden age
as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies
according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies
during the s and s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline
during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology
in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist
due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups
cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history
in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations
there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree
inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values
accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison
this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research ie an ethnographic monograph
as a methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within a community or other research site
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology
ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures
the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic point of view
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal
sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language
comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized west
the standard cross cultural sample includes such cultures
biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions
it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation
archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains
artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies
archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways
linguistic anthropology seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis
ethnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction
it often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions
ethnography views first hand experience and social context as important
tim ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience applicable in general and novel settings while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity
he argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most non western contexts
to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities
boas primitive art claude lvi strauss the way of the masks or geertzs art as cultural system are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics
media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media
other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early s
ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire
ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields such as teaching politics cultural anthropology etc
while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the th and th centuries it was formally termed ethnomusicology by dutch scholar jaap kunst
later the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology
visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid s new media
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media
visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphs paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology
economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical
its origins as a sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronisaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange as an alternative to market exchange
economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange
the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast
economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective
political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture
three main areas of interest rapidly developed
the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes
sahlins work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam
the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system
more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial capitalism around the world
applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems
it is a complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy
applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community
it is closely related to development anthropology
anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves
over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship
broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent and also relatives by marriage
within kinship you have two different families
people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with
this is called consanguinity or blood ties
people can also have a chosen family in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family
in some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families
feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge
anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of europe america and elsewhere
from the perspective of the western world historically such peripheral perspectives have been ignored observed only from an outsider perspective and regarded as less valid or less important than knowledge from the western world
exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology
feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the patriarchal origins of anthropology and note that from to doctorates in anthropology went to males more than more than were under and only to anyone over years old thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first wave feminists until later in life
this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory history linguistics archaeology and anthropology
feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies
gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexism
according to st
clair drake vera mae green was until ell into the s the only african american female anthropologist who was also a caribbeanist
she studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied
however zora neale hurston although often primarily considered to be a literary author was trained in anthropology by franz boas and published tell my horse about her anthropological observations of voodoo in the caribbean
feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies
medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation
it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology
currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole
it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness
on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization
nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development for any given group of people
psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health
it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms
cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them
transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture
as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness and transpersonal experience
however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies
political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena
the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels
firstly anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere
secondly anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions
an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today
geertzs comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example
legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering
earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation
more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings
public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub focus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in
the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science
donna haraways cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings
digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect
it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture
the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases
these include techno anthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology
ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments
the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment
the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environments change across space and time
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology
many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land
often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly or indirectly
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park
social sciences like anthropology can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment
professor kay milton director of the anthropology research network in the school of history and anthropology describes anthropology as distinctive with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non industrial indigenous and traditional societies
anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition
milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory and finally an increased attention to globalization
environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization
anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline
knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems anthropology is now a study of human ecology
human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed
other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral universal etc
in exploring environmentalism the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected particularly from the harmful effects of human activities
environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways
anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by dependent and independent variables primitive ecological wisdom diverse environments resource management diverse cultural traditions and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture
ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names
the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures
modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it
urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism
ulf hannerz quotes a s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition
various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes
there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities
these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other
by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities
by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city
anthrozoology is the study of interaction between living things
it is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy
biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture
physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences
after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primates
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present
it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present
forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition
a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable
the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law
paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology
it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints
genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field
markers on specimens such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations
contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges
the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association which was founded in
its members are anthropologists from around the globe
in a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe
the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology
hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well
as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics
anthropologists like other researchers have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism
as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology
this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms
there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism sexism mutilation and torture
topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation to colonialism have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields
anthropologists involvement with the us government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline
franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expos and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists
but by the s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers
many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence
at the same time david h
prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies
attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up little
many anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement
numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous
the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments
no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given
the current principles of professional responsibility does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions
anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan
the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq
in the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions
after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology
there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work
one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical
the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia
in the s and s calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard
these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals
they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork
on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology
further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past
anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences
by making comparisons across cultural traditions and cultural regions anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science
because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time and space
for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late s
now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors home
it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west
in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain and developing with the center founded by marc aug
since the s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale
there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists
in the th century johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum as a fertilizer
in john bennet lawes and joseph henry gilbert began a set of long term field experiments at rothamsted research in england some of which are still running as of
in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of which used the term agricultural science
the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer
the smith hughes act of shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built
for the next years after federal expenditures on agricultural research in the united states outpaced private expenditures
agriculture agricultural science and agronomy are closely related
however they cover different concepts alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practised in china india the muslim world and europe
in its western form alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in greco roman egypt during the first few centuries ad
alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials
common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals into noble metals the creation of an elixir of immortality and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease
the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus
the concept of creating the philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects
islamic and european alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques theories and terms some of which are still in use today
they did not abandon the ancient greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements and they tended to guard their work in secrecy often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism
in europe the th century translations of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of latin alchemy
this late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science
modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as eric j
holmyard and marie louise von franz that they should be understood as complementary
the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred
the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists
the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts
the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as
this name was itself adopted from the arabic word
the arabic in turn was a borrowing of the late greek term khmea also spelled khumeia and khma with al being the arabic definite article the
together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form
several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term
the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis who derived it from the name of a book the khemeu
hermann diels argued in that it rather derived from used to describe metallic objects formed by casting
others trace its roots to the egyptian name meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand
according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word actually means the egyptian borrowing from the coptic word for egypt
this coptic word derives from demotic itself from ancient egyptian
the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black
alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents
these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships
one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths
in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions
it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other
the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods
following the work of andr jean festugire modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art greek philosophy and different religious traditions
tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus
the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author can help in situating the other authors
zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewess pseudo democritus and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors
the most complete of their works the four books of pseudo democritus were probably written in the first century ad
recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices
it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way
zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence
zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices
since zosimos also called the demons the guardians of places and those who offered them sacrifices priests it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests
while critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the traditions recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples
mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion
alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation
these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others
the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus
his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes
hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemys principal symbols
according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge
the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners
these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era
technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to bc
many writings were lost when the roman emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria
few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x
dating from ad they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver
these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements
between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art
philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character
an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire
according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed
the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are
true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word
the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form
later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth
st augustine later affirmed this in the th and th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry
examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period
most of the greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes
others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text
after ad greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors
by the middle of the th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the th and th centuries
greek alchemy was preserved in medieval byzantine manuscripts after the fall of egypt and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of greek alchemy in the byzantine period
the nd millennium bc text vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold
a considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third century ad text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains such as saltpetre nitre perfume making granulated sugar
buddhist texts from the nd to th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold
according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim
the th century persian chemist and physician ab rayhn brn who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body and immortality while still embodied
sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess dev
some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath
other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyakrakam of ugrditya written in south india in the early th century
two famous early indian alchemical authors were ngrjuna siddha and nityantha siddha
ngrjuna siddha was a buddhist monk
his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine
nityantha siddha wrote rasaratnkara also a highly influential work
in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and ngrjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold
scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white
a modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white
the contents of sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g
jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature
the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating
chapter of himl various works on rasastra and ratnastra gives brief details of a further treatises
in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles
a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature
the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy
after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world
much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations
the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al kmiy
the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy
platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late th and early th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship
in the late ninth and early tenth centuries the arabic works attributed to jbir ibn hayyn introduced a new approach to alchemy
paul kraus who wrote the standard reference work on jabir put it as follows islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism
the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir
jabirs ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life
he analysed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness
according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior
for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist
thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result
by this reasoning the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy
jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the elements physical properties
the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir
his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties
shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity
the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir
from the th to th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus ab al rayhn al brn avicenna and ibn khaldun
in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals
from the th century onwards many materials and practices originally belonging to indian alchemy were assimilated in the persian texts written by muslim scholars
researchers have found evidence that chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with arab alchemists during the medieval period
discovered in bc china the magic square of three was propagated to followers of ab ms jbir ibn ayyn at some point over the proceeding several hundred years
other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements
the silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods ideas ingredients religion and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined
whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine
the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists
in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears
as early as ad ge hong documented the use of metals minerals and elixirs in early chinese medicine
hong identified three ancient chinese documents titled scripture of great clarity scripture of the nine elixirs and scripture of the golden liquor as texts containing fundamental alchemical information
he also described alchemy along with meditation as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend
in his work inner chapters of the book of the master who embraces spontaneous nature hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide
in the centuries following ge hongs death the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among chinese daoists was reduced
in ad tao hongjing refuted hongs statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as shangqing meditation
while hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection he ultimately found the scripture of the nine elixirs to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling aiming to implement more accessible practising techniques
in the early s neidan was adopted by daoists as a new form of alchemy
neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practising alchemy with compounds found in the body rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early dao alchemy
for example saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and did not require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce
the inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region
although those who practised neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation
eternal life remained a consideration for neidan alchemists as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfilment
black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists
it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life
described in th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the th century it was used in cannons by
from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in and in europe by the th century
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion
in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide
thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favour of external sources chinese alchemy was introduced to the west by obed simon johnson
the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to february with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the from an arabic work attributed to khalid ibn yazid
although european craftsmen and technicians pre existed robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing
the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath
translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and muhammad ibn zakariya al razi
these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent
alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples
meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought
the th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context
in the early th century peter abelard followed anselms work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west
in the early th century robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations
grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking
through much of the th and th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made
the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists
in the th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms
albertus magnus a dominican friar is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes trismegistus pseudo democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time
albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals
from the time shortly after his death through to the th century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist
likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas
roger bacon a franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time
while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology
bacons writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life
his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy
like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres
he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time
the practical confirmed the theoretical and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine
in later european legend he became an archmage
in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions
soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber appeared
his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods
it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described
by the end of the th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief
adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body
they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated
finally the alchemists practised their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated
their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam
by purifying the two parts of mans soul man could be reunited with god
in the th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars
alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves
dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars
pope john xxiis edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists
roman catholic inquisitor general nicholas eymerichs directorium inquisitorum written in associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals which eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture
this did not however lead to any change in the inquisitions monitoring or prosecution of alchemists
in henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals
these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone
the th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova
nicolas flamel is a well known alchemist to the point where he had many pseudepigraphic imitators
although the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in
a common idea in european alchemy in the medieval era was a metaphysical homeric chain of wise men that link heaven and earth that included ancient pagan philosophers and other important historical figures
during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy
the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed
in the late th century marsilio ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin
these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent
renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel
esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala
a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists
in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy
he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy
paracelsus cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia
paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver
for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines
his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm
he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them
iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus
john dee followed agrippas occult tradition
although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work
his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below
during the th century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole
proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels
entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe
alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones
rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley
king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick lneburg henry v duke of brunswick lneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists
johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus
although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance
betrger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage
legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists
false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud
the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day
there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic
for example tycho brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute
michael sendivogius a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around
sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in applied this in a submarine
isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics
other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont
their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science
the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the th century
as late as james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold
early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof
robert boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations
he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data
boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the th and th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of lavoisier and john dalton
beginning around a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry
by the s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud
in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the th century scientific enlightenment attempted to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy
this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the th th and st centuries
during the occult revival of the early th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science
the esoteric or occultist school that arose during the th century held the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense less than as a practical tradition or protoscience
this interpretation claimed that the obscure language of the alchemical texts which th century practitioners were not always able to decipher were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes
two seminal figures during this period were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy
both rebuffed the growing successes of chemistry developing a completely esoteric view of alchemy
atwood wrote no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy
atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner
hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state
in baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion
in louis cattiaux published the message retrouv a work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy
in his lineage many researchers including emmanuel and charles dhooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium
several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy
michael maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers stone mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia
zosimos sister theosebia and isis the prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts
the first alchemist whose name we know was mary the jewess
early sources claim that mary devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry
her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes
the laboratory water bath known eponymously as the bain marie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her
essentially a double boiler it was used in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating
the tribikos and the kerotakis are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her
although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the early fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis
after the greco roman period womens names appear less frequently in alchemical literature
towards the end of the middle ages and beginning of the renaissance due to the emergence of print women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries
caterina sforza the countess of forl and lady of imola is one of the few confirmed female alchemists after mary the jewess
as she owned an apothecary she would practice science and conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories
being knowledgeable in alchemy and pharmacology she recorded all of her alchemical ventures in a manuscript named
the manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes covering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine
one of these recipes was for the water of talc
talc which makes up talcum powder is a mineral which when combined with water and distilled was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits
these supposed benefits included turning silver to gold and rejuvenation
when combined with white wine its powder form could be ingested to counteract poison
furthermore if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine it was said to be a source of protection from any poison sickness or plague
other recipes were for making hair dyes lotions lip colours
there was also information on how to treat a variety of ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer
in addition there were instructions on producing the quintessence an elixir which was believed to be able to heal all sicknesses defend against diseases and perpetuate youthfulness
she also wrote about creating the illustrious philosophers stone
some women known for their interest in alchemy were catherine de medici the queen of france and marie de medici the following queen of france who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory
also isabella deste the marchioness of mantua made perfumes herself to serve as gifts
due to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works however it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women
this contributed to a broader pattern in which male authors credited prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience
for example in the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to elisabetta gonzaga the duchess of urbino
in the same book isabella daragona the daughter of alfonso ii of naples is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury
ippolita maria sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones
as the sixteenth century went on scientific culture flourished and people began collecting secrets
during this period secrets referred to experiments and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome
in this period the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was
this book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold medicine and cosmetics
however it is rumoured that a man girolamo ruscelli was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers
in the nineteenth century mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery marked the return of women during the occult revival
the history of alchemy has become a recognized subject of academic study
as the language of the alchemists is analysed historians are becoming more aware of the connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements
institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism the european society for the study of western esotericism and the university of amsterdams sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents
a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam
journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society
western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born
concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology
as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity
similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature
the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone
the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colours
due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the th century diffusion of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy in the th and th centuries was influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations
those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m
principe and william r
newman have interpreted the decknamen of alchemy as physical substances
these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts
at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as florin george clian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts
new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements
groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism
since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought
in the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and neo hermetic practitioners alchemy is primarily spiritual
in this interpretation transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection
according to this view early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul
this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation
in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas hid a spiritual philosophy
in the neo hermeticist interpretation both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible
applied to the alchemist the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal
in texts that are believed to have been written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning
alchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung
jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text translated by his friend richard wilhelm he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in his patients dreams visions or fantasies
he observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation a process that jung called individuation
specifically he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this process of individuation
together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting old alchemical texts compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross references and pored over them
the volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage
his writings are influential in general psychology but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces that comprise all psychic life
both von franz and jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture
among the volumes jung wrote on alchemy his magnum opus is volume of his collected works mysterium coniunctionis
alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment
literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j
rowling and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist
here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus
in the th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late sir terry pratchett
another literary work taking inspiration from the alchemical tradition is the novel the alchemist by brazilian writer paulo coelho
visual artists have had a similar relationship with alchemy
while some used it as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers
in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games
one goal of alchemy the transmutation of base substances into gold is now known to be impossible by means of traditional chemistry but possible by other physical means
although not financially worthwhile gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as
an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth
they observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies in either observational or theoretical astronomy
examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies
a related but distinct subject is physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole
astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical
observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data
in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed
because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die
they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work
further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology
historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws
today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable
professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities
they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory
the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately members
this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy
the international astronomical union comprises almost members from countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond
contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge coupled device camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time
before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation
modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year
analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time
astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes
most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field
those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school
taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable
in college university most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics
while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs
most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties
the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from different nations
like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research
however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research
ascii an acronym for american standard code for information interchange is a character encoding standard for electronic communication
ascii codes represent text in computers telecommunications equipment and other devices
because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented ascii has just code points of which only are which severely limited its scope
modern computer systems have evolved to use unicode which has millions of code points but the first of these are the same as the ascii set
the internet assigned numbers authority prefers the name us ascii for this character encoding
ascii is one of the ieee milestones
ascii was developed in part from telegraph code
its first commercial use was in the teletype model and the teletype model as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services
work on the ascii standard began in may with the first meeting of the american standards associations x subcommittee
the first edition of the standard was published in underwent a major revision during and experienced its most recent update during
compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters
the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in
that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in
originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart in this article
ninety five of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z and punctuation symbols
in addition the original ascii specification included non printing control codes which originated with s most of these are now obsolete although a few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes
for example lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary hexadecimal decimal
despite being an american standard ascii does not have a code point for the cent
it also does not support english terms with diacritical marks such as rsum and jalapeo or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as beyonc
the american standard code for information interchange was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association called the x committee by its x subcommittee and later by that subcommittees x working group
the asa later became the united states of america standards institute and ultimately became the american national standards institute
with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code
there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet
the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks and and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard
the x task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meeting
locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers
the x committee made other changes including other new characters renaming some control characters and moving or removing others
ascii was subsequently updated as usas x then usas x ansi x and finally ansi x
in the x standard the x committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted and recorded on perforated tape
they proposed a track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats
the x subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems
like other character encodings ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols
this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language
before ascii was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols
to include all these and control characters compatible with the comit consultatif international tlphonique et tlgraphique international telegraph alphabet no
standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii
ita was in turn based on baudot code the bit telegraph code mile baudot invented in and patented in
the committee debated the possibility of a shift function which would allow more than codes to be represented by a six bit code
in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes
it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable
the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a seven bit code
the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal
however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice
the committee voted to use a seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission
since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired
eight bit machines that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to
the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification
the first two so called ascii sticks were reserved for control characters
the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits
the committee decided it was important to support uppercase character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code
lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase
to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard
the digits are prefixed with but the remaining bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward
many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters
mechanical typewriters followed the de facto standard set by the remington no
the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of codice were codice early typewriters omitted and using o and l instead but codice and codice pairs became standard once and became common
thus in ascii codice were placed in the second stick positions corresponding to the digits in the adjacent stick
the parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character
this was accommodated by removing codice from and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with and
this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboards notably the teletype model which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii differently from traditional mechanical typewriters
electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the ibm pc especially model m and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did
the codice pair also dates to the no
and the codice pairs were used on some keyboards or codice so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting
however ascii split the codice pair and rearranged mathematical symbols to codice
some then common typewriter characters were not included notably codice while codice were included as diacritics for international use and codice for mathematical use together with the simple line characters codice
the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position hex right before the letter a
the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message end of address end of message end of transmission who are you are you a reserved device control synchronous idle and acknowledge
these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns
ascii code order is also called asciibetical order
collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order
the main deviations in ascii order are an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values
ascii reserves the first code points and the last one for control characters
these are codes intended to control peripheral devices or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape
despite their name these code points do not represent printable characters
for debugging purposes placeholder symbols are assigned to them
for example character xa represents the line feed function and character represents backspace
refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters
except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document
other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting
the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character
the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example the standard is unclear about the meaning of delete
probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option
paper tape was a very popular medium for long term program storage until the s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape
in particular the teletype model machine assignments for codes and became de facto standards
the model was also notable for taking the description of control g literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character
because the keytop for the o key also showed a left arrow symbol a noncompliant use of code interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected
when a teletype asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control s it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control q caused the tape reader to resume
this so called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique
on some systems control s retains its meaning but control q is replaced by a second control s to resume output
the asr also could be configured to employ control r and control t to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively
the teletype could not move its typehead backwards so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a bs
instead there was a key marked that sent code
the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually input paper tape the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored
teletypes were commonly used with the less expensive computers from digital equipment corporation these systems had to use what keys were available and thus the del character was assigned to erase the previous character
because of this dec video terminals sent the del character for the key marked backspace while the separate key marked delete sent an escape sequence many other competing terminals sent a bs character for the backspace key
the early unix tty drivers unlike some modern implementations allowed only one character to be set to erase the previous character in canonical input processing this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using
the assumption that no key sent a bs character allowed ctrlh to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs
many more of the control characters have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones
the escape character for example was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning an escape sequence
this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning
over time this interpretation has been co opted and has eventually been changed
in modern usage an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence which can be used to address the cursor scroll a region set query various terminal properties and more
they are usually in the form of a so called ansi escape code from ecma and its successors
some escape sequences do not have introducers like the vt full reset command
in contrast an esc read from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation or special mode as in the teco and vi text editors
in graphical user interface and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit altogether
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems
the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems
teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return and line feed
the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary
the entire carriage had to be pushed to the right in order to position the paper for the next line
dec operating systems used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device would work
by the time so called glass ttys came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it
when gary kildall created cp m he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in decs rt operating system
until the introduction of pc dos in ibm had no influence in this because their s operating systems used ebcdic encoding instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless
ibms pc dos inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp m and windows in turn inherited it from ms dos
requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself
to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed alone as a line terminator
the tty driver would handle the lf to crlf conversion on output so files can be directly printed to terminal and nl is often used to refer to crlf in unix documents
unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics
on the other hand the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos used carriage return alone as a line terminator however since apple later replaced these obsolete operating systems with their unix based macos operating system they now use line feed as well
the radio shack trs also used a lone cr to terminate lines
computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used ebcdic rather than ascii encoding
the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network
telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt
the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode
this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvts cr lf line ending convention
the pdp monitor and its pdp successor tops used control z as an end of file indication for input from a terminal
some operating systems such as cp m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control z to mark the end of the actual text in the file
for these reasons eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three letter acronym for control z instead of substitute
the end of text character also known as control c was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using control z as the control character to end a file is analogous to the letter zs position at the end of the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid
a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx character convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard
the unix terminal driver uses the end of transmission character also known as control d to indicate the end of a data stream
in the c programming language and in unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero
other representations might be used by specialist equipment for example iso graphics or hexadecimal numbers
codes hex to ehex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols
there are printable characters in total
code hex the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard
since the space character is considered an invisible graphic it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section
code fhex corresponds to the non printable delete control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous sections chart
earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret and the left arrow instead of the underscore
ascii was first used commercially during as a seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx network
twx originally used the earlier five bit ita which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system
bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence
his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe
because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii
on march us president lyndon b
johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used
ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december when utf encoding surpassed it utf is backward compatible with ascii
as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets
one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve asciis character map in the bit range
furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii
from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard
other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling eg with code page
almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries
for example canada had its own version that supported french characters
many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters currency symbols etc
see also yuscii
it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use
however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points
iso iec like ascii is a bit character set
it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries
escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway
because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec a german french or swedish etc
programmer using their national variant of iso iec rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as instead of c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use
many programmers kept their computers on ascii so plain text in swedish german etc
contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to
for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get n jag har smrgsar as the answer which should be n jag har smrgsar meaning no ive got sandwiches
in japan and korea still a variation of ascii is used in which the backslash is rendered as or
this means that for example the file path cuserssmith is shown as cuserssmith or cuserssmith
in europe teletext character sets which are variants of ascii are used for broadcast tv subtitles defined by world system teletext and broadcast using the dvb txt standard for embedding teletext into dvb transmissions
in the case that the subtitles were initially authored for teletext and converted the derived subtitle formats are constrained to the same character sets
eventually as and bit computers began to replace and bit computers as the norm it became common to use an bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended bit relatives of ascii
in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first characters
for some countries bit extensions of ascii were developed that included support for characters used in local languages for example iscii for india and viscii for vietnam
kaypro cp m computers used the upper characters for the greek alphabet
even for markets where it was not necessary to add many characters to support additional languages manufacturers of early home computer systems often developed their own bit extensions of ascii to include additional characters such as box drawing characters semigraphics and video game sprites
often these additions also replaced control characters with even more platform specific extensions
in other cases the extra bit was used for some other purpose such as toggling inverse video this approach was used by atascii an extension of ascii developed by atari
most ascii extensions are based on ascii but some extensions are instead based on the earlier ascii
for example petscii which was developed by commodore international for their bit systems is based on ascii
likewise many sharp mz character sets are based on ascii
ibm defined code page for the ibm pc replacing the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapping additional graphic characters to the upper positions
digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set for use in the popular vt terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics
apple defined mac os roman for the macintosh and adobe defined the postscript standard encoding for postscript both sets contained international letters typographic symbols and punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets
the iso iec standard provided a standard that most systems copied
a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing
iso windows and the original bit ascii were the most common character encodings on the world wide web until when utf overtook them
iso iec introduced additional control codes defined in the f hexadecimal range as part of extending the bit ascii encoding to become an bit system
unicode and the iso iec universal character set have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec and ascii rapidly in many environments
while ascii is limited to characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification and encoding
ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first symbols so the bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets
this allows utf to be backward compatible with bit ascii as a utf file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters
even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set will preserve utf data unchanged
animation is a filmmaking technique by which still images are manipulated to create moving images
in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film
animation has been recognized as an artistic medium specifically within the entertainment industry
many animations are computer animations made with computer generated imagery
stop motion animation in particular claymation has continued to exist alongside these other forms
animation is contrasted with live action film although the two do not exist in isolation
many moviemakers have produced films that are a hybrid of the two
as cgi increasingly approximates photographic imagery filmmakers can easily composite d animations into their film rather than using practical effects for showy visual effects
computer animation can be very detailed d animation while d computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster real time renderings
other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three dimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures
a cartoon is an animated film usually a short film featuring an exaggerated visual style
the style takes inspiration from comic strips often featuring anthropomorphic animals superheroes or the adventures of human protagonists
especially with animals that form a natural predator prey relationship the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life
the illusion of animation as in motion pictures in general has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain
the illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other with unnoticeable interruptions is a stroboscopic effect
while animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment
analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phnakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film
television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally
for display on computers technology such as the animated gif and flash animation were developed
in addition to short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects
the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics for instance moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation
the mechanical manipulation of three dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata
electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics
the word animation stems from the latin animtin stem of animti meaning a bestowing of life
the earlier meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium
long before modern animation began audiences around the world were captivated by the magic of moving characters
for centuries master artists and craftsmen have brought puppets automatons shadow puppets and fantastical lanterns to life inspiring the imagination through physically manipulated wonders
in the stroboscopic disc introduced the principle of modern animation which would also be applied in the zoetrope the flip book the praxinoscope and film
when cinematography eventually broke through in the s the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment
it took years before animation found its way to the cinemas
the successful short the haunted hotel by j
stuart blackton popularized stop motion and reportedly inspired mile cohl to create fantasmagorie regarded as the oldest known example of a complete traditional animation on standard cinematographic film
other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed hand drawn animation in films such as little nemo and gertie the dinosaur
during the s the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us
successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century
felix the cat who debuted in became the first fully realized animal character in the history of american animation
in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry
although disney animations actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very small the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the aesthetic norms of animation ever since
the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the s
the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel animated theatrical shorts
several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck fleischer studios paramount cartoon studios out of the inkwell koko the clown bimbo and betty boop popeye and casper the friendly ghost warner bros
cartoon studios looney tunes porky pig daffy duck elmer fudd bugs bunny tweety sylvester the cat wile e
coyote and the road runner mgm cartoon studios tom and jerry and droopy universal cartoon studios woody woodpecker terrytoons th century foxs mighty mouse and united artists pink panther
in italian argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature length film el apstol which became a critical and commercial success
it was followed by cristianis sin dejar rastros in but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government
after working on it for three years lotte reiniger released the german feature length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in the oldest extant animated feature
in walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs still one of the highest grossing traditional animation features
the fleischer studios followed this example in with gullivers travels with some success
partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war disneys next features pinocchio fantasia fleischer studios second animated feature mr bug goes to town and disneys feature films cinderella alice in wonderland and lady and the tramp failed at the box office
for decades afterward disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features
sullivan bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in
although relatively few titles became as successful as disneys features other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques
soviet soyuzmultfilm animation studio founded in produced films per year on average and reached titles in
china czechoslovakia czech republic italy france and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films while japan became a true powerhouse of animation production with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation
animation became very popular on television since the s when television sets started to become common in most developed countries
cartoons were mainly programmed for children on convenient time slots and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday morning cartoons
many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the s the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series
hanna barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones scooby doo and belgian co production the smurfs
the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts
quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late s and in the early s with hit series the first cartoon of the simpsons which later developed into its own show and spongebob squarepants as part of a renaissance of american animation
while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own child oriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation
japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the s and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co productions with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa wickie und die starken mnner maya the bee and the jungle book
computer animation was gradually developed since the s
d wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the s with an early appearance in the sci fi thriller futureworld
the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera
it was produced using the computer animation production system developed by pixar in collaboration with the walt disney company in the late s in a style similar to traditional cel animation
the so called d style more often associated with computer animation became the dominant technique following the success of pixars toy story the first computer animated feature in this style
most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the s as it proved cheaper and more profitable
not only the very popular d animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand crafted appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects
in the animation market was estimated to be worth circa us billion
by the value had increased to an estimated us billion
animated feature length films returned the highest gross margins of all film genres between and
animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early s
the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality
it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment
during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda
many american studios including warner bros
and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values
some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first feature length animation for their war efforts
animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide
some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs cereals
tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in which were very successful for the company
apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media
animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books
while many comic book characters found their way to the screen original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines
somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games have been derived from films and vice versa
some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media
stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media
songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media
while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example
since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products as have many other disney characters
this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickeys name but licensed disney products sell well and the so called disneyana has many avid collectors and even a dedicated disneyana fan club
disneyland opened in and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters
its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts
disneys earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies
as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field
many are part of general or regional film award programs like the chinas golden rooster award for best animation
awards programs dedicated to animation with many categories include asifa hollywoods annie awards the emile awards in europe and the anima mundi awards in brazil
apart from academy awards for best animated short film and best animated feature animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories relatively often for best original song and best original score
beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture in
up and toy story also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten
the creation of non trivial animation works has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects
traits common to both live action and animated feature length films are labor intensity and high production costs
the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live action films
it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators
it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film
thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole
while live action films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards
another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger
animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film
since the early s teams of about to people of whom to are animators typically have created feature length animated films
it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult
this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins
character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles
on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles
unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film
in the early s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late s
traditional animation was the process used for most animated films of the th century
the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper
to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it
the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings
the completed character cels are photographed one by one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film
the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the st century
today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system
various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects
the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm film and newer media with digital video
the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years
some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology
examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio animal farm lucky and zorba and the illusionist
traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king the prince of egypt akira spirited away the triplets of belleville and the secret of kells
full animation is the process of producing high quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation
fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros
animation studio
many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are non disney works the secret of nimh the iron giant and nocturna
fully animated films are often animated on twos sometimes on ones which means that to drawings are required for a single second of film
limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation
limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation
this is a more economic technique
pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboing boing yellow submarine and certain anime produced in japan
its primary use however has been in producing cost effective animated content for media for television and later the internet
rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in where animators trace live action movement frame by frame
the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life and a scanner darkly
some other examples are fire and ice heavy metal and aku no hana
live action animation is a technique combining hand drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots
one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage
walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies in which a live action girl enters an animated world
other examples include allegro non troppo who framed roger rabbit volere volare space jam and osmosis jones
stop motion is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement
there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the materials used to create the animation
computer software is widely available to create this type of animation traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time consuming to produce than current computer animation
computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer
d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact
d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer
d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using d bitmap graphics and d vector graphics
this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping
d animation has many applications including after effects animation analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation
cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated
final line advection animation is a technique used in d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department
speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm
d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator
the d model maker usually starts by creating a d polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate
a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a d object or d environment
sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices
this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement
other techniques can be applied mathematical functions simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations
these techniques fall under the category of d dynamics
apollo is one of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology
apollo has been recognized as a god of archery music and dance truth and prophecy healing and diseases the sun and light poetry and more
one of the most important and complex of the greek gods he is the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt
he is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the kouros
apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu
as the patron deity of delphi apollo is an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle and also the deity of ritual purification
his oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters
he was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil and is referred to as the averter of evil
medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius
apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows
the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis
apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows
as the god of mousike apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry
he is the inventor of string music and the frequent companion of the muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations
the lyre is a common attribute of apollo
protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona
as a apollo is concerned with the health and education of children and he presided over their passage into adulthood
long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age and dedicated to apollo
the god himself is depicted with long uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth
apollo is an important pastoral deity and he was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds
protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary rustic duties
on the other hand apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions is associated with dominion over colonists and was the giver of laws
his oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city
apollo agyieus was the protector of the streets public places and home entrances
in hellenistic times especially during the th century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios the personification of the sun
in latin texts however there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until st century ce
apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the th century ce
apollo doric arcadocypriot aeolic the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear b texts although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo on the kn e tablet though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read hyperion
the etymology of the name is uncertain
the spelling had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier
it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings at the initiation of the young men during the family festival
according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square
apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the
beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun and suggested a pre greek proto form apalyun
several instances of popular etymology are attested by ancient authors
thus the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb to destroy
plato in cratylus connects the name with redemption with purification and with simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with ever shooting
hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds
in the ancient macedonian language means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word and
the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter
the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from the comparison of cypriot with doric
the name of the lydian god qdns kns may reflect an earlier kalyn before palatalization syncope and the pre lydian sound change y d
note the labiovelar in place of the labial p found in pre doric j and hittite apaliunas
a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter
apollos chief epithet was phoebus literally bright
it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light
like other greek deities he had a number of others applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god
however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature
apollos birthplace was mount cynthus on the island of delos
delphi and actium were his primary places of worship
apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire
in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god
he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character
apollo is considered the most hellenic of the olympian gods
the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the th century bce
the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollos twin sister
at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent python
for the greeks apollo was the most greek of all the gods and through the centuries he acquired different functions
in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing
in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil
walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a dorian northwest greek component a cretan minoan component and a syro hittite component
in classical times his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil and he was therefore called apotropaios and alexikakos
apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer
some commonly used examples are paion epikourios oulios and loimios
in later writers the word paion usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing
apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god paean who did not have a cult of his own
paean serves as the healer of the gods in the iliad and seems to have originated in a pre greek religion
it is suggested though unconfirmed that he is connected to the mycenaean figure pa ja wo ne
paean was the personification of holy songs sung by seer doctors which were supposed to cure disease
homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph
such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollos son asclepius the healer
about the th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered
it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music
apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won
in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra
he sends a plague to the achaeans
knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows called a hecatomb
the homeric hymn to apollo depicts apollo as an intruder from the north
the connection with the northern dwelling dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars
the family festival was dedicated to apollo
apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros
however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella stone
stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi
george huxley regarded the identification of apollo with the minoan deity paiawon worshipped in crete to have originated at delphi
in the homeric hymn apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices
apollo delphinios or delphidios was a sea god especially worshipped in crete and in the islands
apollos sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis the minoan mistress of the animals
in her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the master of the animals a bow wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular apollo
a non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship
the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated
omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts
these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites and from there into greece
homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war
he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods
the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa in asia minor but the word is not complete
the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo
a western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus and qdns whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms in surviving lydian texts
however recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qdns with apollo
the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column
however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day indicates a babylonian origin
the vedic rudra has some similar functions to apollo
the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva
rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is a healer physician god
however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult
unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi
in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality
lycia was sacred to the god for this apollo was also called lycian
apollos cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce
apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity
oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites
in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity
in the rd century apollo fell silent
julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed
apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma
his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus was important enough to be consulted by croesus
oracles were also given by sons of apollo
many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies
they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations
some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order
it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures
the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order
the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances
the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection
from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings
the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms
this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics
the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms
the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple
both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome
in the myths apollo is the son of zeus the king of the gods and leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses
apollo often appears in the myths plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles
as zeus favorite son he had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans
a divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god
pregnant with the offsprings of zeus leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to apollo
however all the lands rejected her out of fear
upon reaching delos leto requested the island to shelter her and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island
delos then revealed to leto that apollo was rumoured to be the god who will greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth
for this reason all the lands were fearful and delos feared that apollo would cast her aside once he is born
hearing this leto swore on the river styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island her son would honour delos the most amongst all the other lands
assured by this delos agreed to assist leto
all goddesses except hera also came to aid leto
however hera had tricked eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to stay on olympus due to which leto was unable to give birth
the goddesses then convinced iris to go bring eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber yards long
iris did accordingly and persuaded eileithyia to step onto the island
thus clutching a palm tree leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights with apollo leaping forth from his mothers womb
the goddesses washed the new born covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him
as leto was unable to feed him themis the goddess of divine law fed him nectar and ambrosia
upon tasting the divine food the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of zeus to humankind
he then started to walk which caused the island to be filled with gold
the island delos used to be asteria a goddess who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of zeus and became a free floating island of the same name
when leto got pregnant hera was told that letos son would become more dear to zeus than ares
enraged by this hera watched over the heavens and sent out ares and iris to prevent leto from giving birth on the earth
ares stationed over the mainland and iris over the islands threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping leto
when leto arrived at thebes fetal apollo prophesied from his mothers womb that in the future he would punish a slanderous woman in thebes so he did not want to be born there
leto then went to thessaly and sought the help of the river nymphs who were the daughters of the river peneus
though he was initially fearful and reluctant peneus later decided to let leto give birth in his waters
he did not change his mind even when ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river
but leto herself declined his help and departed as she did not want him to suffer for her sake
after being turned away from various lands apollo spoke again from the womb asking his mother to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there
when leto approached asteria all the other islands fled
but asteria welcomed leto without any fear of hera
walking on the island she sat down against a palm tree and asked apollo to be born
during the childbirth swans circled the island seven times a sign that later on apollo would play the seven stringed lyre
when apollo finally leapt forth from his mothers womb the nymphs of the island sang a hymn to eileithyia that was heard to the heavens
the moment apollo was born the entire island including the trees and the waters became gold
asteria bathed the newborn swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk
the island had become rooted and was later called delos
hera was no longer angry as zeus had managed to calm her down and she held no grudge against asteria since asteria had rejected zeus in the past
pindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls apollo and artemis as twins
here asteria is also stated to be letos sister
wanting to escape zeus advances she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called ortygia until the twins were born
when leto stepped on the rock four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock
when apollo and artemis were born their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by eileithyia and lachesis one of the three moirai
scorning the advances of zeus asteria transformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea
from her an island rose which was called ortygia
when hera discovered that leto was pregnant with zeus child she decreed that leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine
during this time the monster python also started hounding leto with an intent of killing her because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of letos offspring
however on zeus orders boreas carried away leto and entrusted her to poseidon
to protect her poseidon took her to the island ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it
leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called delos
aelian states that it took leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from hyperborea to delos
leto changed herself into a she wolf before giving birth
this is given as the reason why homer describes apollo as the wolf born god
libanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive leto but by the will of zeus delos then became visible and thus received leto and the children
according to strabo the curetes helped leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening hera they concealed letos childbirth
theognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when apollo was born and the earth laughed with joy
while in some accounts apollos birth itself fixed the floating delos to the earth there are accounts of apollo securing delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later
this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god
apollo was born on the seventh day of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition
the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him
the general consensus is that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo
hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated apollo above all the gods
the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games
there a vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo
apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans leaving his shrine in delphi under the care of dionysus
his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death
no prophecies were issued during this time
he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring
the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return
however diodorus silculus states that apollo visited hyperborea every nineteen years
this nineteen year period was called by the greeks as the year of meton the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions
and that visiting hyperborea at that time apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the pleiades
hyperborea was also letos birthplace
it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves
henceforth hyperborea became apollos winter home and wolves became sacred to him
his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus meaning wolf like
but apollo was also the wolf slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators
the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god
shamanistic elements in apollos cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman
shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo who hailed from hyperborea
in myths the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river eridanos which surrounded hyperborea
apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes
he later gave this arrow to abaris
growing up apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia the personification of truth
phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as a birthday gift
as a four year old child apollo built a foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted
since he learnt the art of building when young he came to be known as archegetes and guided men to build new cities
to keep the child amused the delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it and then with their hands tied behind their backs bit an olive branch
it later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same
from his father zeus apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans
in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by the thriae who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills
the god pan was also said to mentored him in the prophetic art
apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with artemis the art of archery
he then taught the humans the art of healing and archery
soon after giving birth to her twins leto fled from delos fearing hera
upon reaching lycia her infants had drained all of their mothers milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger
the exhausted mother then tried drinking from a nearby lake but was stopped by some lycian peasants
when she begged them to let her quench her thirst the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters
angered by this leto turned them into frogs
in a slightly varied version leto took her infants and crossed over to lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there
but the local herdsmen drove her away
after that some wolves found leto and guided her to the river xanthos where leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst
she then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs
python a chthonic serpent dragon was a child of gaia and the guardian of the delphic oracle
in the callimachus hymn to delos fetal apollo foresees the death of python at his hands
in the homeric hymn to apollo python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant typhon whom hera had created to overthrow zeus
she was described as a terrifying monster and a bloody plague
apollo in his pursuit to establish his worship came across python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow
he let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of delphi
other authors have apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows or a thousand arrows
according to euripides leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of parnassus shortly after giving birth to them
upon seeing the monster there apollo still a child being carried in his mothers arms leapt forth and killed python
some authors also mention that python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards leto
in another account python chased pregnant leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of letos child
however he had to stop the chase when leto came under the protection of poseidon
after his birth four days old apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother
the god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple
this legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry hi paian
according to athenaeus pyhton attacked leto and her twins during their visit to delphi
taking artemis into her arms leto climbed upon a rock and cried at apollo to shoot the monster
the cry let out by her later got slightly altered as an exclamation to avert evils
callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the delphians who let out the cry to encourage apollo when the young god battled with python
strabo has recorded a slightly different version where python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name drakon
when apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves the residents of parnassus complained to the god about python
in response to their pleas apollo killed the man with his arrows
during the fight the parnassians shouted hi paian to encourage the god
continuing from his victory over python the homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans
as apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him he spotted a ship full of cretan merchants or pirates
he took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship
whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission
apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to delphi
upon reaching the land he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests
he instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts
alcaeus narrates the following account zeus who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed apollo to visit delphi to establish his laws among the people
but apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of hyperborea
the delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them
the god returned only after a year and then carried out zeus orders
in other variations the shrine at delphi was simply handed over to apollo by his grandmother phoebe as a gift or themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi
however in many other accounts apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at delphi
gaea came in conflict with apollo for killing python and claiming the delphic oracle for himself
according to pindar she sought to banish apollo to tartarus as a punishment
according to euripides soon after apollo took the ownership of the oracle gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans
as a result people stopped visiting delphi to obtain prophecies
troubled by this apollo went to olympus and supplicated to zeus
zeus admiring the ambitions of his young son granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions
this sealed the role of apollo as the oracular deity of delphi
since apollo had committed a blood crime he also had to be purified
pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification
in one of them both apollo and artemis fled to sicyon and were purified there
in the other tradition that had been prevalent among the cretans apollo alone travelled to crete and was purified by carmanor
in another account the argive king crotopus was the one who performed the purification rites on apollo alone
according the aristonous and aelian apollo was purified by the will of zeus in the vale of tempe
aristonous has continued the tale saying that apollo was escorted back to delphi by athena
as a token of gratitude he later built a temple for athena at delphi which served as a threshold for his own temple
upon reaching delphi apollo convinced gaea and themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him
to celebrate this event other immortals also graced apollo with gifts poseidon gave him the land of delphi the delphian nymphs gifted him the corycian cave and artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land
some others have also said that apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king admetus as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed
it was when he was serving as a cowherd under admetus that the theft of the cattle by hermes happened
the servitude was said to have lasted for either one year or one great year or nine years
plutarch however has mentioned a variation where apollo was neither purified in tempe nor banished to earth as a servant for nine years but was driven out to another world for nine great years
the god who returned was cleansed and purified thus becoming a true phoebus that is to say clear and bright
he then took over the delphic oracle which had been under the care of themis in his absence
henceforth apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder made men aware of their guilt and purified them
the pythian games were also established by apollo either as funeral games to honor python or to celebrate his own victory
the pythia was apollos high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies
tityus was another giant who tried to rape leto either on his own accord when she was on her way to delphi or at the order of hera
leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant
apollo still a young boy shot him with his arrows
in some accounts artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows
for this act he was banished to tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver or his heart
another account recorded by strabo says that tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom apollo killed at the request of the residents
admetus was the king of pherae who was known for his hospitality
when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python he served as a herdsman under admetus who was then young and unmarried
apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with admetus during his stay
after completing his years of servitude apollo went back to olympus as a god
because admetus had treated apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return
apollos mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins
apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis the daughter of king pelias by taming a lion and a boar to draw admetus chariot
he was present during their wedding to give his blessings
when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister
when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time
according to another version or perhaps some years later when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus
apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this but his mother leto intervened and reminding zeus of their old love pleaded with him not to kill their son
zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus
the love between apollo and admetus was a favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius
the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in letos womb
niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion
she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children seven male and seven female while leto had only two
she further mocked apollos effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance
leto insulted by this told her children to punish niobe
accordingly apollo killed niobes sons and artemis her daughters
according to some versions of the myth among the niobids chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto
amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge
a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept
her tears formed the river achelous
zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them
when chloris married and had children apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids
hence nestor was able to live for generations
once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance with zeus words
apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris
apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida while poseidon built the walls of troy
other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall
in ovids account apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre
in pindars odes the gods took a mortal named aeacus as their assistant
when the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus
apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacuss descendants the aeacidae
however the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves
angered by the unpaid labour and the insults apollo infected the city with a pestilence and poseidon sent the sea monster cetus
to deliver the city from it laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione
during his stay in troy apollo had a lover named ourea who was a nymph and daughter of poseidon
together they had a son named ileus whom apollo loved dearly
apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans
during the war the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis the daughter of apollos priest chryses and refused to return her
angered by this apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment
he demanded that they return the girl and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad
receiving the aegis from zeus apollo entered the battlefield as per his fathers command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry
he pushed the greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers
he is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the trojan army when they were falling apart
when zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war apollo was provoked by poseidon to a duel
however apollo declined to fight him saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals
when the greek hero diomedes injured the trojan hero aeneas aphrodite tried to rescue him but diomedes injured her as well
apollo then enveloped aeneas in a cloud to protect him
he repelled the attacks diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god
aeneas was then taken to pergamos a sacred spot in troy where he was healed
after the death of sarpedon a son of zeus apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his fathers wish and cleaned it
he then gave it to sleep and death
apollo had also once convinced athena to stop the war for that day so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while
the trojan hero hector was favored by apollo
when he got severely injured apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms
during a duel with achilles when hector was about to lose apollo hid hector in a cloud of mist to save him
when the greek warrior patroclus tried to get into the fort of troy he was stopped by apollo
encouraging hector to attack patroclus apollo stripped the armour of the greek warrior and broke his weapons
patroclus was eventually killed by hector
at last after hectors fated death apollo protected his corpse from achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse shielding it from the rays of the sun
apollo held a grudge against achilles throughout the war because achilles had murdered his son tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son troilus in his own temple
not only did apollo save hector from achilles he also tricked achilles by disguising himself as a trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates
he foiled achilles attempt to mutilate hectors dead body
finally apollo caused achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by paris into achilles heel
in some versions apollo himself killed achilles by taking the disguise of paris
apollo helped many trojan warriors including agenor polydamas glaucus in the battlefield
though he greatly favored the trojans apollo was bound to follow the orders of zeus and served his father loyally during the war
apollo kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young especially boys
he oversees their education and their passage into adulthood
education is said to have originated from apollo and the muses
many myths have him train his children
it was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to apollo after reaching adulthood
chiron the abandoned centaur was fostered by apollo who instructed him in medicine prophecy archery and more
chiron would later become a great teacher himself
asclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father
however he was later entrusted to chiron for further education
anius apollos son by rhoeo was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth
apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts
anius later became the priest of apollo and the king of delos
iamus was the son of apollo and evadne
when evadne went into labour apollo sent the moirai to assist his lover
after the child was born apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey
when iamus reached the age of education apollo took him to olympia and taught him many arts including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds
idmon was educated by apollo to be a seer
even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the argonauts he embraced his destiny and died a brave death
to commemorate his sons bravery apollo commanded boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero and to honor him
apollo adopted carnus the abandoned son of zeus and europa
he reared the child with the help of his mother leto and educated him to be a seer
when his son melaneus reached the age of marriage apollo asked the princess stratonice to be his sons bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed
apollo saved a shepherd boy from death in a large deep cave by means of vultures
to thank him the shepherd built apollo a temple under the name vulturius
immediately after his birth apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music
as the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians
the invention of string music is attributed to him
plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of apollo and the muses
according to socrates ancient greeks believed that apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans
for this reason he was called homopolon before the homo was replaced by a
apollos harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like dionysus he is also called the liberator
the swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of apollo
they are apollos sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to hyperborea
aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to apollo the swans would join the chant in unison
among the pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of apollo their principal deity
their belief was that music purifies the soul just as medicine purifies the body
they also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres
apollo appears as the companion of the muses and as musagetes he leads them in dance
they spend their time on parnassus which is one of their sacred places
apollo is also the lover of the muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like orpheus and linus
apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre
in his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods like the marriage of eros and psyche peleus and thetis
he is a frequent guest of the bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs
apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others
he was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris
the invention of the lyre is attributed either to hermes or to apollo himself
distinctions have been made that hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre apollo invented was a regular lyre
myths tell that the infant hermes stole a number of apollos cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks
in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides
he used one of the cows intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre
upon discovering the theft apollo confronted hermes and asked him to return his cattle
when hermes acted innocent apollo took the matter to zeus
zeus having seen the events sided with apollo and ordered hermes to return the cattle
hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented
apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre
hence apollo then became the master of the lyre
according to other versions apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to marsyas
hermes lyre therefore would be a reinvention
once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest
the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire
pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present
then apollo struck the strings of his lyre
it was so beautiful that tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement
only midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award
apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey
marsyas was a satyr who was punished by apollo for his hubris
he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy
athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished
when marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy
this led marsyas to think that he was better than apollo and he challenged the god to a musical contest
the contest was judged by the muses or the nymphs of nysa
athena was also present to witness the contest
marsyas taunted apollo for wearing his hair long for having a fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts
he also further said the muses and athena sniggered at this comment
the contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser
according to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the nysiads
but in the next round apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance
marsyas argued against this saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating
but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all
the nymphs decided that apollos argument was just
apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience
marsyas could not do this
apollo was declared the winner and angered with marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr
according to another account marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat
out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack
another variation is that apollo played his instrument upside down
marsyas could not do this with his instrument
so the muses who were the judges declared apollo the winner
apollo hung marsyas from a tree to flay him
apollo flayed the limbs of marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god
he then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed marsyas flayed skin to a nearby pine tree as a lesson to the others

then apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands

during his absence delphi was under the care of dionysus and no prophecies were given during winters
periphas was an attican king and a priest of apollo
he was noble just and rich
he did all his duties justly
because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as zeus
at one point they worshipped periphas in place of zeus and set up shrines and temples for him
this annoyed zeus who decided to annihilate the entire family of periphas
but because he was a just king and a good devotee apollo intervened and requested his father to spare periphas
zeus considered apollos words and agreed to let him live
but he metamorphosed periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds
when periphas wife requested zeus to let her stay with her husband zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish
molpadia and parthenos were the sisters of rhoeo a former lover of apollo
one day they were put in charge of watching their fathers ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty
while they were asleep the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept
when the sisters woke up and saw what had happened they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their fathers wrath
apollo who was passing by caught them and carried them to two different cities in chersonesus molpadia to castabus and parthenos to bubastus
he turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors
molpadias name was changed to hemithea upon her deification
prometheus was the titan who was punished by zeus for stealing fire
he was bound to a rock where each day an eagle was sent to eat prometheus liver which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day
seeing his plight apollo pleaded with zeus to release the kind titan while artemis and leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes
zeus moved by apollos words and the tears of the goddesses finally sent heracles to free prometheus
after heracles was struck with madness and killed his family he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of apollo
apollo through the pythia commanded him to serve king eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him
only then would alcides be absolved of his sin
apollo also renamed him heracles
to complete his third task heracles had to capture the ceryneian hind a hind sacred to artemis and bring back it alive
after chasing the hind for one year the animal eventually got tired and when it tried crossing the river ladon heracles captured it
while he was taking it back he was confronted by apollo and artemis who were angered at heracles for this act
however heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her
after much pleading artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later
after he was freed from his servitude to eurystheus heracles fell in conflict with iphytus a prince of oechalia and murdered him
soon after he contracted a terrible disease
he consulted the oracle of apollo once again in the hope of ridding himself of the disease
the pythia however denied to give any prophesy
in anger heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away intending to start his own oracle
however apollo did not tolerate this and stopped heracles a duel ensued between them
artemis rushed to support apollo while athena supported heracles
soon zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them
he reprimanded heracles for this act of violation and asked apollo to give a solution to heracles
apollo then ordered the hero to serve under omphale queen of lydia for one year in order to purify himself
after their reconciliation apollo and heracles together founded the city of gythion
a long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon
each human being was completely round with four arms and four legs two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears and all else to match
they were powerful and unruly
otis and ephialtes even dared to scale mount olympus
to check their insolence zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them
he cut them all in two and asked apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now
apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it
this is what we call navel today
he smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest
but he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment
leukatas was believed to be a white colored rock jutting out from the island of leukas into the sea
it was present in the sanctuary of apollo leukates
a leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love
once aphrodite fell deeply in love with adonis a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar
heartbroken aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of leukas
when she reached the sanctuary of apollo in argos she confided in him her love and sorrow
apollo then brought her to the rock of leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock
she did so and was freed from her love
when she sought the reason behind this apollo told her that zeus before taking another lover would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for hera
another tale relates that a man named nireus who fell in love with the cult statue of athena came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself
after jumping he fell into the net of a fisherman in which when he was pulled out he found a box filled with gold
he fought with the fisherman and took the gold but apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others
it was an ancestral custom among the leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of apollo for the sake of averting evil
however a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island
this was the same rock from which according to a legend sappho took her suicidal leap
once hera out of spite aroused the titans to war against zeus and take away his throne
accordingly when the titans tried to climb mount olympus zeus with the help of apollo artemis and athena defeated them and cast them into tartarus

he was later resurrected and taken to heaven
the festival hyacinthia was a national celebration of sparta which commemorated the death and rebirth of hyacinthus
another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles
apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth
cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked apollo to let his tears fall forever
apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk
admetus the king of pherae was also apollos lover
during his exile which lasted either for one year or nine years apollo served admetus as a herdsman
the romantic nature of their relationship was first described by callimachus of alexandria who wrote that apollo was fired with love for admetus
plutarch lists admetus as one of apollos lovers and says that apollo served admetus because he doted upon him
latin poet ovid in his said that even though he was a god apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of admetus
tibullus describes apollos love to the king as servitium amoris and asserts that apollo became his servant not by force but by choice
he would also make cheese and serve it to admetus
his domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family
when admetus wanted to marry princess alcestis apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed
this satisfied alcestis father and he let admetus marry his daughter
further apollo saved the king from artemis wrath and also convinced the moirai to postpone admetus death once

additionally apollo fostered and educated chiron the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods including apollos sons
apollo also fostered carnus the son of zeus and europa
love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology
their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination
daphne was a nymph who scorned apollos advances and ran away from him
when apollo chased her in order to persuade her she changed herself into a laurel tree
according to other versions she cried for help during the chase and gaia helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place
according to roman poet ovid the chase was brought about by cupid who hit apollo with a golden arrow of love and daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred
the myth explains the origin of the laurel and the connection of apollo with the laurel and its leaves which his priestess employed at delphi
the leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the pythian games
marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well
zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old
sinope a nymph was approached by the amorous apollo
she made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin

apollo wished to court her
cassandra promised to return his love on one condition he should give her the power to see the future
apollo fulfilled her wish but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after
angered that she broke her promise apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future no one would ever believe her prophecies
the sibyl of cumae like cassandra promised apollo her love if he would give her a boon
the sibyl took a handful of sand and asked apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands
apollo granted her wish but sibyl went back on her word
although sibyl did live an extended life as apollo had promised he did not give her agelessness along with it so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained
hestia the goddess of the hearth rejected both apollos and poseidons marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried
in one version of the prophet tiresiass origins he was originally a woman who promised apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons
apollo gave her her wish but then she went back on her word and refused him
apollo in anger turned her into a man
artemis as the sister of apollo is thea apollousa that is she as a female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as a male divinity
in the pre hellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo
however this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic period
artemis like her brother is armed with a bow and arrows
she is the cause of sudden deaths of women
she also is the protector of the young especially girls
though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang
the laurel was sacred to both
artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians at a place called hypsoi
apollo daphnephoros had a temple in eretria a place where the citizens are to take the oaths
in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon
hecate the goddess of witchcraft and magic is the chthonic counterpart of apollo
they both are cousins since their mothers leto and asteria are sisters
one of apollos epithets hecatos is the masculine form of hecate and both names mean working from afar
while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness
if hecate is the gate keeper apollo agyieus is the door keeper
hecate is the goddess of crossroads and apollo is the god and protector of streets
the oldest evidence found for hecates worship is at apollos temple in miletos
there hecate was taken to be apollos sister counterpart in the absence of artemis
hecates lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements at the same time apollos solar nature
as a deity of knowledge and great power apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena
being zeus favorite children they were given more powers and duties
apollo and athena often took up the role of protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities
athena was the principal goddess of athens apollo was the principal god of sparta
as patrons of arts apollo and athena were companions of the muses the former a much more frequent companion than the latter
apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus
in the trojan war as zeus executive apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does
apollos decisions were usually approved by his sister athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus
in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war
apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover
orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies
apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage
they invade his temple and he drives them away
he says that the matter should be brought before athena
apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollos supplicant
apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo
the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks
as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus
on the occasion of a pestilence in the s bce apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare
during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius
in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome
after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollos temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour
he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill
sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era
the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games
also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos
athenian annual festivals included the boedromia metageitnia pyanepsia and thargelia
spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia
thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria
apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow
other attributes of his included the kithara the plectrum and the sword
another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers
the pythian games were held in apollos honor every four years at delphi
the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games
the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos
animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas ravens hawks crows snakes mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin
homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had a hawk as his messenger
in many myths apollo is transformed into a hawk
in addition claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawk keepers who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god
eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the citys symbol is a man with a hawklike face
claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language
as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce
according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy
however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars
in this interpretation apollos title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves
in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian
however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase
apollo is often associated with the golden mean
this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony
in antiquity apollo was associated with the planet mercury
the ancient greeks believed that mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening because each twilight mercury would appear farther from the sun as it set than it had the night before
the morning planet was called apollo and the one at evening hermes mercury before they realised they were the same thereupon the name mercury hermes was kept and apollo was dropped
apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance
the earliest greek word for a statue is delight and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision
maurice bowra notices that the greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined
the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity
the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment
the statues of apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength
in the balance and relation of their limbs such figures express their whole character mental and physical and reveal their central being the radiant reality of youth in its heyday
numerous free standing statues of male youths from archaic greece exist and were once thought to be representations of apollo though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals
in v
leonardos proposed the term kouros to refer to those from keratea this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in to cover all statues of this format
the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos
such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone
significantly more rare are the life sized bronze statues
one of the few originals which survived into the present day so rare that its discovery in was described as a miracle by ernst homann wedeking is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo
it was found in piraeus a port city close to athens and is believed to have come from north eastern peloponnesus
it is the only surviving large scale peloponnesian statue
the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara a sophisticated seven stringed variant of the lyre in his left arm
while none of the greek originals have survived several roman copies from approximately the late st or early nd century exist of which an example is the apollo barberini
apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a cithara or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree
the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century
the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce
the life size so called adonis found in on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars
in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a gods divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire
another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse
the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great
some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed
apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music dance and poetry
apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture
percy bysshe shelley composed a hymn of apollo and the gods instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinskys apollon musagte
in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love
apollo has been portrayed in modern literature such as when charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture

the austroasiatic languages are a large language family spoken throughout mainland southeast asia south asia and east asia
these languages are natively spoken by the majority of the population in vietnam and cambodia and by minority populations scattered throughout parts of thailand laos india myanmar malaysia bangladesh nepal and southern china
approximately million people speak an austroasiatic language of which more than two thirds are vietnamese speakers
of the austroasiatic languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have lengthy established presences in the historical record
only two are presently considered to be the national languages of sovereign states vietnamese in vietnam and khmer in cambodia
the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand while the wa language is a recognized national language in the de facto autonomous wa state within myanmar
santali is one of the scheduled languages of india
the remainder of the familys languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status
ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages
these form thirteen established families which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda
however one recent classification posits three groups while another has abandoned mon khmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family
austroasiatic languages appear to be the extant autochthonous languages in mainland southeast asia with the neighboring kra dai hmong mien austronesian and sino tibetan languages having arrived via later migrations
the name austroasiatic was coined by wilhelm schmidt based on the latin word for south and asia
despite the literal meaning of its name only three austroasiatic branches are actually spoken in south asia khasic munda and nicobarese
regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed full syllable
this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety of phonological shapes of the same original proto austroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants among the modern languages
as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely non existent in most branches except munda and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches
the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal voice and breathy voice or between modal voice and creaky voice
languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even four way voicing contrast
however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis
vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure
much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry l
shortos mon khmer comparative dictionary
little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented
with their demotion from a primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic
paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for
is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in
linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh and nepal
however no evidence for this classification has ever been published
each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade
by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated
in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional mon khmer as a valid unit
however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review
in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo
diffloths widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in encyclopdia britannica and except for the breakup of southern mon khmer in ethnologue
peiros is a lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary
this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact
indeed when sidwell replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal structure below
diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published
as a schematic we have or in more detail paul sidwell in a lexicostatistical comparison of languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic
he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence
sidwell blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a khasi palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic
if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward
sidwell blench suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that a vieto katuic connection is worth investigating
in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since proto austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly
subsequently sidwell proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other
a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake like structure with an east west division occurring possibly as early as years before present
however he still considers the subbranching dubious
integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china
sidwell tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up years bp during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by bp austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan
both the reconstructed lexicon of proto austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around bp cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments
at bp this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre neolithic hunter gatherer cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by bp and in southern indochina by bp however sidwell found that iron is not reconstructable in proto austroasiatic since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages
during the iron age about bp relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic katuic pearic and khmer were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch underwent more extensive internal diversification
by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present day locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age
paul sidwell considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around years bp during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of proto austroasiatic itself is older than that date
the lexicon of proto austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum
the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items form part of the later stratum
roger blench suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies can be reconstructed for proto austroasiatic
blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp
eel prawn shrimp crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap
archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina dates back to only about years ago with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to bp sidwell proposes that the locus of proto austroasiatic was in the red river delta area about years before present instead of the middle mekong as he had previously proposed
austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys
khmuic palaungic and khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the red valley valley
based on their current distributions about half of all austroasiatic branches can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals
hence this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino tibetan whose speakers had a distinct non riverine culture
in addition to living an aquatic based lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft
as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as sino tibetan
sidwell gives a more nested classification of austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of austroasiatic languages using a word list
many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages
pakanic and shompen were not included
roger blench also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modern day languages
john peterson suggests that pre munda languages may have once dominated the eastern indo gangetic plain and were then absorbed by indo aryan languages at an early date as indo aryan spread east
peterson notes that eastern indo aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western indo aryan languages do not
other than latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer thai lao and burmese alphabets
vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing
this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the th century
the following are examples of past used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages
austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis which also includes the austronesian languages and in some proposals also the kra dai languages and the hmong mien languages
several lexical resemblances are found between the hmong mien and austroasiatic language families some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt
this could imply a relation or early language contact along the yangtze
according to cai hmong mien people are genetically related to austroasiatic speakers and their languages were heavily influenced by sino tibetan especially tibeto burman languages
it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indo aryan languages including sanskrit and middle indo aryan languages
indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages
additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha and the ngas
mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup ob which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china and haplogroup ob which is common in todays japanese and koreans are the carriers of early rice agriculture from southern china
another study suggests that the haplogroup ob is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and ob the para austroasiatic lineage of the koreans and yayoi people
a full genomic study by lipson et al
identified a characteristic lineage that can be associated with the spread of austroasiatic languages in southeast asia and which can be traced back to remains of neolithic farmers from mn bc in the red river delta in northern vietnam and to closely related ban chiang and vat komnou remains in thailand and cambodia respectively
this austroasiatic lineage can be modeled as a sister group of the austronesian peoples with significant admixture from a deeply diverging eastern eurasian source and which is ancestral to modern austroasiatic speaking groups of southeast asia such as the mlabri and the nicobarese and partially to the austroasiatic munda speaking groups of south asia
significant levels of austroasiatic ancestry were also found in austronesian speaking groups of sumatra java and borneo
austroasiatic speaking groups in southern china predominatly carry the same mainland southeast asian neolithic farmer ancestry but with additional geneflow from northern and southern east asian lineages that can be associated with the spread of tibeto burman and kra dai languages respectively
according to chaubey et al
austro asiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia followed by extensive sex specific admixture with local indian populations
according to riccio et al
the munda peoples are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia
according to zhang et al
austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum circa years ago
arunkumar et al
suggest austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia occurred into northeast india kya and into east india kya
the afroasiatic languages also known as hamito semitic or semito hamitic are a language family of about languages spoken predominantly in west asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahara and sahel
over million people are native speakers of an afroasiatic language constituting the fourth largest language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo
most linguists divide the family into six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian semitic and omotic
the vast majority of afroasiatic languages are considered indigenous to the african continent including all those not belonging to the semitic branch
arabic if counted as a single language is by far the most widely spoken within the family with around million native speakers concentrated primarily in the middle east and north africa
other major afroasiatic languages include the chadic hausa language with over million native speakers the semitic amharic language with million and the cushitic somali language with million
other afroasiatic languages with millions of native speakers include the cushitic sidaama language the semitic tigrinya language and the omotic wolaitta language though most languages within the family are much smaller in size
there are many well attested afroasiatic languages from antiquity that have since died or gone extinct including egyptian and the semitic languages akkadian biblical hebrew phoenician amorite and ugaritic
there is no consensus among historical linguists as to precisely where or when the common ancestor of all afroasiatic languages known as proto afroasiatic was originally spoken
however most agree that the afroasiatic homeland was located somewhere in northeastern africa with specific proposals including the horn of africa egypt the eastern sahara
a significant minority of scholars argues for an origin in the levant
the reconstructed timelines of when proto afroasiatic was spoken vary extensively with dates ranging from bc to bc
even the latest plausible dating makes afroasiatic the oldest language family accepted by contemporary linguists
comparative study of afroasiatic is hindered by the massive disparities in textual attestation between its branches while the semitic and egyptian branches are attested in writing as early as the fourth millennium bc berber cushitic and omotic languages were often not recorded until the th or th centuries
while systematic sound laws have not yet been established to explain the relationships between the various branches of afroasiatic the languages share a number of common features
one of the most important for establishing membership in the branch is a common set of pronouns
other widely shared features include a prefix m which creates nouns from verbs evidence for alternations between the vowel a and a high vowel in the forms of the verb similar methods of marking gender and plurality and some details of phonology such as the presence of pharyngeal fricatives
other features found in multiple branches include a specialized verb conjugation using suffixes a specialized verb conjugation using prefixes verbal prefixes deriving middle causative and passive verb forms and a suffix used to derive adjectives
in current scholarship the most common names for the family are afroasiatic hamito semitic and semito hamitic
other proposed names that have yet to find widespread acceptance include erythraic erythraean lisramic noahitic and lamekhite
friedrich mller introduced the name hamito semitic to describe the family in his
the variant semito hamitic is mostly used in older russian sources
the elements of the name were derived from the names of two sons of noah as attested in the book of genesiss table of nations passage semitic from the first born shem and hamitic from the second born ham
within the table of nations each of noahs sons is presented as the common progenitor of various people groups deemed to be closely related among others shem was the father of the jews assyrians and arameans while ham was the father of the egyptians and cushites
this genealogy does not reflect the actual origins of these peoples languages for example the canaanites are descendants of ham according to the table even though hebrew is now classified as a canaanite language while the elamites are ascribed to shem despite their language being totally unrelated to hebrew
the term semitic for the semitic languages had already been coined in by august ludwig von schlzer following an earlier suggestion by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in
hamitic was first used by ernest renan in to refer to languages that appeared similar to the semitic languages but were not themselves provably a part of the family
the belief in a connection between africans and the biblical ham which had existed at least as far back as isidore of seville in the th century ad led scholars in the early th century to speak vaguely of hamian or hamitish languages
the term hamito semitic has largely fallen out of favor among linguists writing in english but is still frequently used in the scholarship of various other languages such as german
several issues with the label hamito semitic have led many scholars to abandon the term and criticize its continued use
one common objection is that the hamitic component inaccurately suggests that a monophyletic hamitic branch exists alongside semitic
in addition joseph greenberg has argued that hamitic possesses racial connotations and that hamito semitic overstates the centrality of the semitic languages within the family
by contrast victor porkhomovsky suggests that the label is simply an inherited convention and doesnt imply a duality of semitic and hamitic any more than indo european implies a duality of indic and european
because of its use by several important scholars and in the titles of significant works of scholarship the total replacement of hamito semitic is difficult
while greenberg ultimately popularized the name afroasiatic in it appears to have been coined originally by maurice delafosse as french in
the name refers to the fact that it is the only major language family with large populations in both africa and asia
due to concerns that afroasiatic could imply the inclusion of all languages spoken across africa and asia the name afrasian was proposed by igor diakonoff in
at present it predominantly sees use among russian scholars
the names lisramic based on the afroasiastic root lis and the egyptian word rm and erythraean referring to the core area around which the languages are spoken the red sea have also been proposed
scholars generally consider afroasiatic to have between five and eight branches
the five that are universally agreed upon are berber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic
most specialists consider the omotic languages to constitute a sixth branch
due to the presumed distance of relationship between the various branches many scholars prefer to refer to afroasiatic as a linguistic phylum rather than a language family
victoria almansa villatoro and silvia tubov nigrelli write that there are about languages in afroasiatic ethnologue lists languages
many scholars estimate fewer languages exact numbers vary depending on the definitions of language and dialect
the berber languages are spoken today by perhaps million people
they are often considered to constitute a single language with multiple dialects
other scholars however argue that they are a group of around twelve languages about as different from each other as the romance or germanic languages
in the past berber languages were spoken throughout north africa except in egypt since the th century ce however they have been heavily affected by arabic and have been replaced by it in many places
there are two extinct languages potentially related to modern berber
the first is the numidian language represented by over a thousand short inscriptions in the libyco berber alphabet found throughout north africa and dating from the nd century bce onward
the second is the guanche language which was formerly spoken on the canary islands and went extinct in the th century ce
the first longer written examples of modern berber varieties only date from the th or th centuries ce
chadic languages number between and making chadic the largest family in afroasiatic
the chadic languages are typically divided into three major branches east chadic central chadic and west chadic
most chadic languages are located in the chad basin with the exception of hausa
hausa is the largest chadic language by native speakers and is spoken by a large number of people as a lingua franca in northern nigeria
it may have as many as to million first and second language speakers
eight other chadic languages have around speakers other chadic languages often have few speakers and may be endangered of going extinct
only about chadic languages have been fully described by linguists
there are about cushitic languages more if omotic is included spoken around the horn of africa and in sudan and tanzania
the cushitic family is traditionally split into four branches the single language of beja the agaw languages eastern cushitic and southern cushitic
only one cushitic language oromo has more than million speakers other languages with more than a million speakers include somali afar hadiyya and sidaama
many cushitic languages have relatively few speakers
cushitic does not appear to be related to the written ancient languages known from its area meroitic or old nubian
the oldest text in a cushitic language probably dates from around written orthographies were only developed for a select number of cushitic languages in early th century
the egyptian branch consists of a single language ancient egyptian which was historically spoken in the lower nile valley
egyptian is first attested in writing around bce and finally went extinct around ce making it the language with the longest written history in the world
egyptian is usually divided into two major periods earlier egyptian which is further subdivided into old egyptian and middle egyptian and later egyptian which is further subdivided into late egyptian demotic and coptic
coptic is the only stage written alphabetically to show vowels whereas egyptian was previously written in egyptian hieroglyphs which only represent consonants
in the coptic period there is evidence for six major dialects which presumably existed previously but are obscured by pre coptic writing additionally middle egyptian appears to be based on a different dialect than old egyptian which in turn shows dialectal similarities to late egyptian
egyptian was replaced by arabic as the spoken language of egypt but coptic continues to be the liturgical language of the coptic orthodox church
the c
omotic languages are still mostly undescribed by linguists
they are all spoken in southwest ethiopia except for the ganza language spoken in sudan
omotic is typically split into north omotic and south omotic with the latter more influenced by the nilotic languages it is unclear whether the dizoid group of omotic languages belongs to the northern or southern group
the two omotic languages with the most speakers are wolaitta and gamo gofa dawro with about million speakers each
a majority of specialists consider omotic to constitute a sixth branch of afroasiatic
omotic was formerly considered part of the cushitic branch some scholars continue to consider it part of cushitic
other scholars have questioned whether it is afroasiatic at all due its lack of several typical aspects of afroasiatic morphology
there are between and languages in the semitic family
today semitic languages are spoken across north africa west asia and the horn of africa as well as on the island of malta making them the sole afroasiatic branch with members originating outside africa
arabic spoken in both asia and africa is by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language today with around million native speakers while the ethiopian amharic language has around million
most authorities divide semitic into two branches east semitic which includes the extinct akkadian language and west semitic which includes arabic aramaic the canaanite languages as well as the ethiopian semitic languages such as geez and amharic
the classification within west semitic remains contested
the only group with an african origin is ethiopian semitic
the oldest written attestations of semitic languages come from mesopotamia northern syria and egypt and date as early as c
there is no agreement on the relationships between and subgrouping of the different afroasiatic branches
whereas marcel cohen claimed he saw no evidence for internal subgroupings numerous other scholars have made proposals with carsten peust counting as of
common trends in proposals as of include using common or lacking grammatical features to argue that omotic was the first language to branch off often followed by chadic
in contrast to scholars who argue for an early split of chadic from afroasiatic scholars of the russian school tend to argue that chadic and egyptian are closely related and scholars who rely on percentage of shared lexicon often group chadic with berber
three scholars who agree on an early split between omotic and the other subbranches but little else are harold fleming christopher ehret and lionel bender
in contrast scholars relying on shared lexicon often produce a cushitic omotic group
additionally the minority of scholars who favor an asian origin of afroasiatic tend to place semitic as the first branch to split off
disagreement on which features are innovative and which are inherited from proto afroasiatic produces radically different trees as can be seen by comparing the trees produced by ehret and igor diakonoff
responding to the above tom gldemann criticizes attempts at finding subgroupings based on common or lacking morphology by arguing that the presence or absence of morphological features is not a useful way of discerning subgroupings in afroasiatic because it can not be excluded that families currently lacking certain features did not have them in the past this also means that the presence of morphological features cannot be taken as defining a subgroup
peust notes that other factors that can obscure genetic relationships between languages include the poor state of present documentation and understanding of particular language families
gene gragg likewise argues that more needs to be known about omotic still and that afroasiatic linguists have still not found convincing isoglosses on which to base genetic distinctions
one way of avoiding the problem of determining which features are original and which are inherited is to use a computational methodology such as lexicostatistics with one of the earliest attempts being fleming
this is also the method used by alexander militarev and sergei starostin to create a family tree
fleming was a more recent attempt by fleming with a different result from militarev and starostin
hezekiah bacovcin and david wilson argue that this methodology is invalid for discerning linguistic sub relationship
they note the methods inability to detect various strong commonalities even between well studied branches of aa
a relationship between hebrew arabic and aramaic and the berber languages was perceived as early as the th century ce by the hebrew grammarian and physician judah ibn quraysh who is regarded as a forerunner of afroasiatic studies
the french orientalist guillaume postel had also pointed out similarities between hebrew arabic and aramaic in and hiob ludolf noted similarities also to geez and amharic in
this family was formally described and named semitic by august ludwig von schlzer in
in theodor benfey first described the relationship between semitic and the egyptian language and connected both to the berber and the cushitic languages
in the same year tn newman suggested a relationship between semitic and the hausa language an idea that was taken up by early scholars of afroasiatic
in ernst renan named these languages related to semitic but not semitic hamitic in carl lottner proposed that they belonged to a single language family and in friedrich mller first described them as a hamito semitic language family
mller assumed that there existed a distinct hamitic branch of the family that consisted of egyptian berber and cushitic
he did not include the chadic languages though contemporary egyptologist karl richard lepsius argued for the relation of hausa to the berber languages
some scholars would continue to regard hausa as related to the other afroasiatic languages but the idea was controversial many scholars refused to admit that the largely unwritten negroid chadic languages were in the same family as the caucasian ancient civilizations of the egyptians and semites
an important development in the history of afroasiatic scholarship and the history of african linguistics was the creation of the hamitic theory or hamitic hypothesis by lepsius fellow egyptologist christian bunsen and linguist christian bleek
this theory connected the hamites the originators of hamitic languages with caucasians who were assumed to have migrated into africa and intermixed with indigenous negroid africans in ancient times
the hamitic theory would serve as the basis for carl meinhofs highly influential classification of african languages in his book
on one hand the hamitic classification was justified partially based on linguistic features for example meinhof split the presently understood chadic family into hamito chadic and an unrelated non hamitic chadic based on which languages possessed grammatical gender
on the other hand the classification also relied on non linguistic anthropological and culturally contingent features such as skin color hair type and lifestyle
ultimately meinhofs classification of hamitic proved to include languages from every presently recognized language family within africa
the first scholar to question the existence of hamitic languages was marcel cohen in with skepticism also expressed by a
klingenheben and dietrich westermann during the s and s
however meinhofs hamitic classification remained prevalent throughout the early th century until it was definitively disproven by joseph greenberg in the s based on racial and anthropological data
instead greenberg proposed an afroasiatic family consisting of five branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic
reluctance among some scholars to recognize chadic as a branch of afroasiatic persisted as late as the s
in harold fleming proposed that a group of languages classified by greenberg as cushitic were in fact their own independent omotic branch a proposal that has been widely if not universally accepted
these six branches now constitute an academic consensus on the genetic structure of the family
greenberg relied on his own method of mass comparison of vocabulary items rather than the comparative method of demonstrating regular sound correspondences to establish the family
an alternative classification based on the pronominal and conjugation systems was proposed by an tucker in
as of widely accepted sound correspondences between the different branches have not yet been firmly established
nevertheless morphological traits attributable to the proto language and the establishment of cognates throughout the family have confirmed its genetic validity
there is no consensus as to when proto afroasiatic was spoken
the absolute latest date for when proto afroasiatic could have been extant is after which egyptian and the semitic languages are firmly attested
however in all likelihood these languages began to diverge well before this hard boundary
the estimations offered by scholars as to when proto afroasiatic was spoken vary widely ranging from bce to bce
an estimate at the youngest end of this range still makes afroasiatic the oldest proven language family
contrasting proposals of an early emergence tom gldemann has argued that less time may have been required for the divergence than is usually assumed as it is possible for a language to rapidly restructure due to areal contact with the evolution of chadic serving as pertinent examples
likewise no consensus exists as to where proto afroasiatic originated
scholars have proposed locations for the afroasiatic homeland across africa and west asia
roger blench writes that the debate possesses a strong ideological flavor with associations between an asian origin and high civilization
an additional complicating factor is the lack of agreement on the subgroupings of afroasiatic this makes associating archaeological evidence with the spread of afroasiatic particularly difficult
nevertheless there is a long accepted link between the speakers of proto southern cushitic languages and the east african savanna pastoral neolithic and archaeological evidence associates the proto cushitic speakers with economic transformations in the sahara dating c
ago as well as the speakers of the proto zenati variety of the berber languages with an expansion across the maghreb in the th century ce
an origin somewhere on the african continent has broad scholarly support and is seen as being well supported by the linguistic data
most scholars more narrowly place the homeland near the geographic center of its present distribution in the southeastern sahara or adjacent horn of africa
the afroasiatic languages spoken in africa are not more closely related to each other than they are to semitic as one would expect if only semitic had remained in an west asian homeland while all other branches had spread from there
likewise all semitic languages are fairly similar to each other whereas the african branches of afroasiatic are very diverse this suggests the rapid spread of semitic out of africa
proponents of an origin of afroasiatic within africa assume the proto language to have been spoken by pre neolithic hunter gatherers arguing that there is no evidence of words in proto afroasiatic related to agriculture or animal husbandry
christopher ehret so y
keita and paul newman also argue that archaeology does not support a spread of migrating farmers into africa but rather a gradual incorporation of animal husbandry into indigenous foraging cultures
ehret in a separate publication argued that the two principles in linguistic approaches for determining the origin of languages which are the principles of fewest moves and greatest diversity had put beyond reasonable doubt that the language family had originated in the horn of africa
a significant minority of scholars supports an asian origin of afroasiatic most of whom are specialists in semitic or egyptian studies
the main proponent of an asian origin is the linguist alexander militarev who argues that proto afroasiatic was spoken by early agriculturalists in the levant and subsequently spread to africa
militarev associates the speakers of proto afroasiatic with the levantine post natufian culture arguing that the reconstructed lexicon of flora and fauna as well as farming and pastoralist vocabulary indicates that proto aa must have been spoken in this area
scholar jared diamond and archaeologist peter bellwood have taken up militarevs arguments as part of their general argument that the spread of linguistic macrofamilies can be associated with the development of agriculture they argue that there is clear archaeological support for farming spreading from the levant into africa via the nile valley
afroasiatic languages share a number of phonetic and phonological features
egyptian cushitic berber omotic and most languages in the semitic branch all require a syllable to begin with a consonant
igor diakonoff argues that this constraint goes back to proto afroasiatic
some chadic languages allow a syllable to begin with a vowel however in many chadic languages verbs must begin with a consonant
in cushitic and chadic languages a glottal stop or glottal fricative may be inserted to prevent a word from beginning with a vowel
typically syllables only begin with a single consonant
with the exception of some chadic languages all afroasiatic languages allow both closed and open syllables many chadic languages do not allow a syllable to end in a consonant
most words end in a vowel in omotic and cushitic making syllable final consonant clusters rare
diakonoff argues that proto afroasiatic syllables disallowed consonant clusters or vowels at the end of a syllable
syllable weight plays an important role in aa especially in chadic it can affect the form of affixes attached to a word
several afroasiatic languages have large consonant inventories and it is likely that this is inherited from proto afroasiatic
all afroasiatic languages contain stops and fricatives some branches have additional types of consonants such as affricates and lateral consonants
aa languages tend to have pharyngeal fricative consonants with egyptian semitic berber and cushitic sharing and
in all aa languages consonants can be bilabial alveolar velar and glottal with additional places of articulation found in some branches or languages
additionally the glottal stop usually exists as a phoneme and there tends to be no phonemic contrast between and gerald heard became an influential friend of huxley and since the mid s had been exploring vedanta as a way of understanding individual human life and the individuals relationship to the universe
heard and huxley both saw the political implications of vedanta which could help bring about peace specifically that there is an underlying reality that all humans and the universe are a part of
in the s huxley and gerald heard both became active in the effort to avoid another world war writing essays and eventually publicly speaking in support of the peace pledge union
but they remained frustrated by the conflicting goals of the political left some favoring pacifism while other wanting to take up arms against fascism in the spanish civil war
after joining the ppu huxley expressed his frustration with politics in a letter from the thing finally resolves itself into a religious problem an uncomfortable fact which one must be prepared to face and which i have come during the last year to find it easier to face
huxley and heard turned their attention to addressing the big problems of the world through transforming the individual
a forest is only as green as the individual trees of the forest is green
this was the genesis of the human potential movement that gained traction in the s
in the late s huxley and heard immigrated to the united states and beginning in and continuing until his death in huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda
together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices
from until huxley contributed articles to vedanta and the west published by the society
he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from through
in the gospel of ramakrishna was published by the ramakrishna vivekananda center in new york
the book was translated by swami nikhilananda with help from joseph campbell and margaret woodrow wilson daughter of us president woodrow wilson
aldous huxley wrote in the foreward
a book unique so far as my knowledge goes in the literature of hagiography
never have the small events of a contemplatives daily life been described with such a wealth of intimate detail
never have the casual and unstudied utterances of a great religious teacher been set down with so minute a fidelity
in huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california
as an advocate of the perennial philosophy huxley was drawn to the gita as he explained in the introduction written during wwii when it was still not clear who would win as a means of personally realizing the divine reality he described a minimum working hypothesis in the introduction to swami prabhavanandas and christopher isherwoods translation of the bhagavad gita and in a free standing essay in vedanta and the west a publication of vedanta press
this is the outline that huxley elaborates on in the article huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples
two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from
in early huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline
huxley had initiated a correspondence with doctor humphry osmond a british psychiatrist then employed in a canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline osmond obliged and supervised huxleys session in southern california
after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the societys journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions
huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception
huxley wrote that the mystical experience is doubly valuable it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self centered and more creative life
having tried lsd in the s he became an advisor to timothy leary and richard alpert in their early s research work with psychedelic drugs at harvard
personality differences led huxley to distance himself from leary when huxley grew concerned that leary had become too keen on promoting the drugs rather indiscriminately even playing the rebel with a fondness for publicity
differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxleys eyesight at specific points in his life
circa huxley encountered the bates method in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett
in huxley relocated from hollywood to a ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county
huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert
he reported that for the first time in more than years he was able to read without glasses and without strain
he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch
he wrote a book about his experiences with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in
the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about huxleys eyesight
it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford
for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty brazilian author joo ubaldo ribeiro who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late s wrote that huxley had said to him with a wry smile i can hardly see at all
and i dont give a damn really
on the other hand huxleys second wife laura later emphasised in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight
after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by walter c
alvarez she tempered her statement laura huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxleys vision
her account in this respect agrees with the following sample of huxleys own words from the art of seeing nevertheless the topic of huxleys eyesight has continued to endure similar significant controversy
huxley married on july maria nys a belgian epidemiologist from bellem a village near aalter he met at garsington oxfordshire in
they had one child matthew huxley who had a career as an author anthropologist and prominent epidemiologist
in maria huxley died of cancer
in huxley married laura archera also an author as well as a violinist and psychotherapist
she wrote this timeless moment a biography of huxley
she told the story of their marriage through mary ann braubachs documentary huxley on huxley
huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in in the years that followed with his health deteriorating he wrote the utopian novel island and gave lectures on human potentialities both at the ucsf medical center and at the esalen institute
these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement
huxley was a close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school now besant hill school of happy valley in ojai california
the most substantial collection of huxleys few remaining papers following the destruction of most in the bel air fire is at the library of the university of california los angeles
some are also at the stanford university libraries
on april huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature the senior literary organisation in britain and he accepted the title via letter on april
the correspondence between huxley and the society is kept at the cambridge university library
the society invited huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at somerset house london in june
huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society however his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend
in huxley was diagnosed with oral cancer and for the next three years his health steadily declined
on november th less than three weeks before huxleys death author christopher isherwood a friend of years visited in cedars sinai hospital and wrote his impressions at home on his deathbed unable to speak owing to cancer that had metastasized huxley made a written request to his wife laura for lsd g intramuscular
according to her account of his death in this timeless moment she obliged with an injection at am and a second dose an hour later huxley died aged at pm pst on november
media coverage of huxleys death along with that of fellow british author c
lewis was overshadowed by the assassination of john f
kennedy on the same day less than seven hours before huxleys death
in a article for new york magazine titled the eclipsed celebrity death club christopher bonanos wrote this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreefts book between heaven and hell a dialog somewhere beyond death with john f
kennedy c
lewis aldous huxley which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths
huxleys memorial service took place in london in december it was led by his elder brother julian
on october his ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton guildford surrey england
huxley had been a long time friend of russian composer igor stravinsky who dedicated his last orchestral composition to huxley
what became was begun in july completed in october and premiered by the chicago symphony orchestra on april
in huxley was one of six british writers commemorated on a series of uk postage stamps issued by royal mail to celebrate british science fiction
one classic science fiction novel from each author was depicted with brave new world chosen to represent huxley
aberdeen is a city in scotland
algae are any of a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms
the name is an informal term for a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades
included organisms range from unicellular microalgae such as chlorella prototheca and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga which may grow up to in length
most are aquatic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem that are found in land plants
the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta a division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and stoneworts
algae that are carried by water are plankton specifically phytoplankton
algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways
green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga
algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction
algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids of bryophytes rhizoids of non vascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes
most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy
some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus
some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae
algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria
fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to to billion years ago
because of the wide range of types of algae they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society
traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for thousands of years and have strong traditions in east asia food cultures
more modern algaculture applications extend the food traditions for other applications include cattle feed using algae for bioremediation or pollution control transforming sunlight into algae fuels or other chemicals used in industrial processes and in medical and scientific applications
a review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration in order to mitigate climate change while providing lucrative value added products for global economies
the singular is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english
the etymology is obscure
although some speculate that it is related to latin be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature
a more likely source is binding entwining
the ancient greek word for seaweed was which could mean either the seaweed or a red dye derived from it
the latinization meant primarily the cosmetic rouge
the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical paint a cosmetic eye shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean
it could be any color black red green or blue
the study of algae is most commonly called phycology the term is falling out of use
one definition of algae is that they have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells
on the other hand the colorless prototheca under chlorophyta are all devoid of any chlorophyll
although cyanobacteria are often referred to as blue green algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes including cyanobacteria from the definition of algae
the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria
chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events
the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae
their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right
many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic
some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely
linnaeus in species plantarum the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae
in systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina and a species of acetabularia among the animals
in samuel gottlieb gmelin published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus
it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves
harvey and lamouroux were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation
this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics
harveys four divisions are red algae brown algae green algae and diatomaceae
at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers studying the infusoria
unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile
even the nonmotile microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals
although used as a taxonomic category in some pre darwinian classifications eg linnaeus de jussieu lamouroux harvey horaninow agassiz wilson cassin in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group
throughout the th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes bacillariophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes euglenophytes and chlorophytes
later many new groups were discovered and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes many heterokontophytes haptophytes and chlorarachniophytes
with the abandonment of plant animal dichotomous classification most groups of algae were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota
however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications
some parasitic algae were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others had their relationship with algae conjectured early
in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae but later were seen as endophytic algae
some filamentous bacteria were originally seen as algae
furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae
algae are polyphyletic thus their origin cannot be traced back to single hypothetical common ancestor
it is thought that they came into existence when photosynthetic coccoid cyanobacteria got phagocytized by a unicellular heterotrophic eukaryote giving rise to double membranous primary plastids
such symbiogenic events are believed to have occurred more than billion years ago during the calymmian period early in boring billion but it is difficult to track the key events because of so much time gap
primary symbiogenesis gave rise to three divisions of archaeplastids namely the viridiplantae rhodophyta and glaucophyta whose plastids further spread into other protist lineages through eukaryote eukaryote predation engulfments and subsequent endosymbioses
this process of serial cell capture and enslavement explains the diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes
recent genomic and phylogenomic approaches have significantly clarified plastid genome evolution the horizontal movement of endosymbiont genes to the host nuclear genome and plastid spread throughout the eukaryotic tree of life
fossils of isolated spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as million years ago during the late cambrian early ordovician period from sessile shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara which likely got stranded ashore when riverine lacustrine water levels dropped during dry seasons
these charophyte algae probably already developed filamentous thalli and holdfasts that superficially resembled plant stems and roots and probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations
they perhaps evolved some mya and might even be as early as gya during the late phase of the boring billion
a range of algal morphologies is exhibited and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common
the only groups to exhibit three dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns and some chlorophytes
apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds various browns and the charophytes
the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode stems whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes
conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns
most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups
some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species are in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation
these are the brown algae some of which may reach m in length the red algae and the green algae
the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants
the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo
hence the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes
the term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined
algal turfs are thick carpet like beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like corals and kelps and they are usually less than cm tall
such a turf may consist of one or more species and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more
some common characteristics are listed many algae particularly species of the characeae have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials
phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too
some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms
in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells
the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae
examples are lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure
the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota
in nature they do not occur separate from lichens
it is unknown when they began to associate
one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria
a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species
the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone
the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont
trentepohlia is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised
lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them
endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponges
the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for to of sponge growth in some species
rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal divisions have life cycles which show considerable variation and complexity
in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes
asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible
commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote
to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated pheromones may play a key role in these processes
sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle
however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction
meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae
the algal collection of the us national herbarium consists of approximately dried specimens which although not exhaustive gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species
estimates vary widely
for example according to one standard textbook in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be algal species in the uk
another checklist reports only about species
regarding the difference of about species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species
and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above
most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton
the most recent estimate suggests algal species worldwide
the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid th century
algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of cryptogamic plants by spores
spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms
whether a spore is to grow into an adult organism depends on the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands
the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers
however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them
marine spores are often spread by ocean currents
ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces
to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses
it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae
when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships
for example ulva reticulata and u
fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner
mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns
for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there
however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies
algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow and ice
seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under deep however some such as navicula pennata have been recorded to a depth of
a type of algae ancylonema nordenskioeldii was found in greenland in areas known as the dark zone which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet
same algae was found in the italian alps after pink ice appeared on parts of the presena glacier
the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology
microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column provide the food base for most marine food chains
in very high densities these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms
algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems
in many cases algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants
due to this the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants
to detect these changes algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease
on the basis of their habitat algae can be categorized as aquatic terrestrial aerial lithophytic halophytic psammon thermophilic cryophilic epibiont endosymbiont parasitic calcifilic or lichenic
in classical chinese the word is used both for algae and for literary talent
the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao which thus simultaneously means island of the algae viewing hall and island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent
agar a gelatinous substance derived from red algae has a number of commercial uses
it is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi as most microorganisms cannot digest agar
alginic acid or alginate is extracted from brown algae
its uses range from gelling agents in food to medical dressings
alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization
molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours
between and wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in new mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed
to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from policy on the long run biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels
here algae based fuels hold great promise directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass
the break even point for algae based biofuels is estimated to occur by
today algae are used by humans in many ways for example as fertilizers soil conditioners and livestock feed
aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds
algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places
maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner
naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food especially in asia leading some to label them as superfoods
they provide many vitamins including a b b b niacin and c and are rich in iodine potassium iron magnesium and calcium
in addition commercially cultivated microalgae including both algae and cyanobacteria are marketed as nutritional supplements such as spirulina chlorella and the vitamin c supplement from dunaliella high in beta carotene
algae are national foods of many nations china consumes more than species including fat choy a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable japan over species such as nori and aonori ireland dulse chile cochayuyo
laver is used to make laverbread in wales where it is known as
in korea green laver is used to make
it is also used along the west coast of north america from california to british columbia in hawaii and by the mori of new zealand
sea lettuce and badderlocks are salad ingredients in scotland ireland greenland and iceland
algae is being considered a potential solution for world hunger problem
furthermore it contains all nine of the essential amino acids the body does not produce on its own the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids
for example parietochloris incisa is high in arachidonic acid where it reaches up to of the triglyceride pool
some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long chain essential omega fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid
fish oil contains the omega fatty acids but the original source is algae which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain
algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long chain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil which only contains the short chain alpha linolenic acid
agricultural research service scientists found that of nitrogen runoff and of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber
scientists developed the ats which consists of shallow foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years
they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans
researchers collected and dried the nutrient rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer
they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers
algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds
various polymers can be created from algae which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics
these include hybrid plastics cellulose based plastics poly lactic acid and bio polyethylene
several companies have begun to produce algae polymers commercially including for use in flip flops and in surf boards
the alga stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites biodegrading the synthetic substance
the natural pigments produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical dyes and coloring agents
the presence of some individual algal pigments together with specific pigment concentration ratios are taxon specific analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods particularly high performance liquid chromatography can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural algae populations in sea water samples
carrageenan from the red alga chondrus crispus is used as a stabilizer in milk products
analysis of variance is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures used to analyze the differences among means
anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher
anova is based on the law of total variance where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation
in its simplest form anova provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal and therefore generalizes the t test beyond two means
in other words the anova is used to test the difference between two or more means
while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler
these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model
laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the s
around laplace and gauss developed the least squares method for combining observations which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy
it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares
laplace knew how to estimate a variance from a residual sum of squares
by laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides
before astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times and had developed methods of reducing the errors
the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added
an eloquent non mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in
ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a article on theoretical population genetics the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance
his first application of the analysis of variance to data analysis was published in studies in crop variation i this divided the variation of a time series into components representing annual causes and slow deterioration
fishers next piece studies in crop variation ii written with winifred mackenzie and published in studied the variation in yield across plots sown with different varieties and subjected to different fertiliser treatments
analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers book statistical methods for research workers
randomization models were developed by several researchers
the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in
in the illustrations to the right groups are identified as x x etc
in the first illustration the dogs are divided according to the product of two binary groupings young vs old and short haired vs long haired
since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups has a relatively large variance and since the means are very similar across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group a dog is in doesnt allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a dog show
thus this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution
an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful
the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter
as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more distinguishable
however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot distinguish x and x reliably
grouping dogs according to a coin flip might produce distributions that look similar
an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit
all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy
the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds
the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments
a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models
the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship
there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here
the fixed effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change
this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole
random effects model is used when the treatments are not fixed
this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population
because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments differ from the fixed effects model
a mixed effects model contains experimental factors of both fixed and random effects types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types
teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook with each text considered a treatment
the fixed effects model would compare a list of candidate texts
the random effects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts
the mixed effects model would compare the incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives
defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with multiple competing definitions
the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks
note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels
interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data
the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently identically and normally distributed for fixed effects models that is that the errors are independent and formula in a randomized controlled experiment the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol
this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out
the objective random assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of c
peirce and ronald fisher
this design based analysis was discussed and developed by francis j
anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university
kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david r
in its simplest form the assumption of unit treatment additivity states that the observed response formula from experimental unit formula when receiving treatment formula can be written as the sum of the units response formula and the treatment effect formula that is formula the assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that for every treatment formula the formulath treatment has exactly the same effect formula on every experiment unit
the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified according to cox and kempthorne
however many consequences of treatment unit additivity can be falsified
for a randomized experiment the assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments
therefore by contraposition a necessary condition for unit treatment additivity is that the variance is constant
the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design based inference that is standard in finite population survey sampling
kempthorne uses the randomization distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previously
the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studies
however there are differences
for example the randomization based analysis results in a small but negative correlation between the observations
in the randomization based analysis there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence
on the contrary the observations are dependent the randomization based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time
since the randomization based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach
few statisticians object to model based analysis of balanced randomized experiments
however when applied to data from non randomized experiments or observational studies model based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization
for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers
in practice the estimates of treatment effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent
in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public
the normal model based anova analysis assumes the independence normality and homogeneity of variances of the residuals
the randomization based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment
both these analyses require homoscedasticity as an assumption for the normal model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization based analysis
however studies of processes that change variances rather than means have been successfully conducted using anova
there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the f test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest
problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions
the property of unit treatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit treatment additivity
if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance
also a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow a multiplicative model
according to cauchys functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition
anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest
the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances
this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance
multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance
so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations
in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations to simplify data entry
this is an example of data coding
the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance
calculating a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean
anova uses traditional standardized terminology
the definitional equation of sample variance is formula where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom the summation is called the sum of squares the result is called the mean square and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean
anova estimates sample variances a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means and a treatment variance
the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means
the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model
for example the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels
formula the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components specifies a chi squared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect
formula the f test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation
for example in one way or single factor anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic formula formula where ms is mean square formula is the number of treatments and formula is the total number of cases to the f distribution with formula being the numerator degrees of freedom and formula the denominator degrees of freedom
using the f distribution is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled chi squared distribution
the expected value of f is formula which is for no treatment effect
as values of f increase above the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis
two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls
the anova f test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors
for example to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect the f tests p values closely approximate the permutation tests p values the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced
such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses as observed by rosenbaum
the anova f test is recommended as a practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributions
anova consists of separable parts partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually
anova is used to support other statistical tools
regression is first used to fit more complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simple models that adequately describe the data
such models could be fit without any reference to anova but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients
e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel models not as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex high dimensional inferences
the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor
more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares
the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors
a relatively complete discussion of the analysis of the completely randomized experiment is available
there are some alternatives to conventional one way analysis of variance eg welchs heteroscedastic f test welchs heteroscedastic f test with trimmed means and winsorized variances brown forsythe test alexander govern test james second order test and kruskal wallis test available in onewaytests r formula where that is we envision an additive model that says every data point can be represented by summing three quantities the true mean averaged over all factor levels being investigated plus an incremental component associated with the particular column plus a final component associated with everything else affecting that specific data value
anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors
when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor it is termed factorial
factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases
consequently factorial designs are heavily used
the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication
in a way anova with factors x y and z the anova model includes terms for the main effects and terms for interactions
all terms require hypothesis tests
the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance
fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rare
the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova
testing one factor at a time hides interactions but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results
caution is advised when encountering interactions test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found
texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction
interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data
neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value
a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects
graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding
regression is often useful
a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox
some interactions can be removed while others cannot
a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense
one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically insignificant
an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications
some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses
because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments
in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment
experimentation is often sequential
early experiments are often designed to provide mean unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error
later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals
reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology
provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions
the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards
besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units
these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase and methods based on achieving a desired confidence interval
power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level
power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true
several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model
standardized effect size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines
however while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature a non standardized measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposes
sometimes tests are conducted to determine whether the assumptions of anova appear to be violated
residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality
residuals should have the appearance of noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and modeled data values
trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations
a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed by additional tests
this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses
follow up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned or post hoc
planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are conceived only after looking at the data
the follow up tests may be simple pairwise comparisons of individual group means or may be compound comparisons
comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels
often the follow up tests incorporate a method of adjusting for the multiple comparisons problem
follow up tests to identify which specific groups variables or factors have statistically different means include the tukeys range test and duncans new multiple range test
in turn these tests are often followed with a compact letter display methodology in order to render the output of the mentioned tests more transparent to a non statistician audience
there are several types of anova
many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking
it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model
balanced experiments are relatively easy to interpret unbalanced experiments offer more complexity
for single factor anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power
for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications
the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case
this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply
consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs
in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and f ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered
anova is a test of statistical significance
the american psychological association holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred
anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model
all consider the observations to be the sum of a model and a residual to be minimized
the kruskal wallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normality
below we make clear the connection between multi way anova and linear regression
linearly re order the data so that formula th observation is associated with a response formula and factors formula where formula denotes the different factors and formula is the total number of factors
in one way anova formula and in two way anova formula
furthermore we assume the formula th factor has formula levels namely formula
now we can one hot encode the factors into the formula dimensional vector formula
the one hot encoding function formula is defined such that the formula th entry of formula is formula the vector formula is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all formula
thus formula
in order to obtain a fully general formula way interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector formula and then add an intercept term
let that vector be formula
with this notation in place we now have the exact connection with linear regression
we simply regress response formula against the vector formula
however there is a concern about identifiability
in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero
from here one can use f statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors
we can consider the way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has levels and the second factor has levels
define formula if formula and formula if formula ie formula is the one hot encoding of the first factor and formula is the one hot encoding of the second factor
with that formula where the last term is an intercept term
for a more concrete example suppose that formula then formula in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon
in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon carbon bonds are single
alkanes have the general chemical formula
the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane where n to arbitrarily large and complex molecules like pentacontane or ethyl methyl octane an isomer of tetradecane
the international union of pure and applied chemistry defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms
however some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic or polycyclic despite them having a distinct general formula
in an alkane each carbon atom is sp hybridized with sigma bonds and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms
the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone
the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane
one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about
with their repeated units the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of u
methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi
nevertheless most alkanes do not have much biological activity
they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active reactive functional groups of biological molecules
the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum and natural gas
an alkyl group is an alkane based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding
they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group r although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group
ordinarily the c c single bond distance is
saturated hydrocarbons can be linear branched or cyclic
the third group is sometimes called cycloalkanes
very complicated structures are possible by combining linear branch cyclic alkanes
alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways forming structural isomers
the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches
this isomer is sometimes called the n isomer
however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points
the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms
for example for acyclic alkanes branched alkanes can be chiral
for example methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number
the above list only includes differences of connectivity not stereochemistry
in addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings
such compounds are called cycloalkanes and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula
for example cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are isomers of each other but are not isomers of butane
branched alkanes are more thermodynamically stable than their linear isomers
for example the highly branched tetramethylbutane is about kcal mol more stable than its linear isomer n octane
the iupac nomenclature for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains
unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane
in august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine one une for the hydrocarbons cnhn cnhn cnhn cnhn cnhn
in modern nomenclature the first three specifically name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds while one now represents a ketone
straight chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n or n where a non linear isomer exists
although this is not strictly necessary and is not part of the iupac naming system the usage is still common in cases where one wishes to emphasize or distinguish between the straight chain and branched chain isomers eg n butane rather than simply butane to differentiate it from isobutane
alternative names for this group used in the petroleum industry are linear paraffins or n paraffins
the first four names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid
alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel from the basic numerical term
hence pentane ch hexane ch heptane ch octane ch etc
the numeral prefix is generally greek however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the latin prefix non
simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example n pentane isopentane and neopentane
iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name
though technically distinct from the alkanes this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes
as their description implies they contain one or more rings
simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes
cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones eg cyclopentane is a cycloalkane with carbon atoms just like pentane but they are joined up in a five membered ring
in a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc
substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by the cahn ingold prelog priority rules
the trivial name for alkanes is paraffins
together alkanes are known as the paraffin series
trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts
they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry
cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes
branched chain alkanes are called isoparaffins
paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers ie compounds of the same chemical formula eg pentane and isopentane
all alkanes are colorless
alkanes with the lowest molecular weights are gases those of intermediate molecular weight are liquids and the heaviest are waxy solids
alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces
the cumulative effects of these intermolecular forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes
under standard conditions from ch to ch alkanes are gaseous from ch to ch they are liquids and after ch they are solids
as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has an almost linear relationship with the size of the molecule
as a rule of thumb the boiling point rises c for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series
a straight chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact and thus greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules
for example compare isobutane and n butane which boil at and c and dimethylbutane and dimethylbutane which boil at and c respectively
on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact
the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above
that is the larger the molecule the higher the melting point
there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points
solids have a more rigid and fixed structure than liquids
this rigid structure requires energy to break down
thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart
for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above
the odd numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes
this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a well organized structure which requires more energy to break apart
the odd numbered alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart
for a visualization of the crystal structures see
the melting points of branched chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight chain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase
alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field
for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water
since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order
as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they are insoluble in water
their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high a property that is called lipophilicity
alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves
the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water
hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane water mixture
the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics
it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons
the carbon atoms in alkanes are described as sp hybrids that is to say that to a good approximation the valence electrons are in orbitals directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron which are derived from the combination of the s orbital and the three p orbitals
geometrically the angle between the bonds are cos
this is exact for the case of methane while larger alkanes containing a combination of c h and c c bonds generally have bonds that are within several degrees of this idealized value
an alkane has only c h and c c single bonds
the former result from the overlap of an sp orbital of carbon with the s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms
the bond lengths amount to m for a c h bond and m for a c c bond
the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp orbitals they are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of between them
structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not accurately depict the geometry
the spatial arrangement of the c c and c h bonds are described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation
in ethane the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes there is nearly free rotation about a carbon carbon single bond
two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation
the staggered conformation is kj mol lower in energy than the eclipsed conformation
in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ from the optimal value to accommodate bulky groups
such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance or strain
strain substantially increases reactivity
spectroscopic signatures for alkanes are obtainable by the major characterization techniques
the c h stretching mode gives a strong absorptions between and cm and weaker bands for the c c stretching mode absorbs between and cm
the carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at cm and cm while methylene groups show bands at cm and cm
carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around cm
the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at h the carbon resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon c and quaternary
the carbon resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time
since alkanes have high ionization energies their electron impact mass spectra show weak currents for their molecular ions
the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals
the mass spectra for straight chain alkanes is illustrated by that for dodecane the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group is absent fragments are more intense than the molecular ion and are spaced by intervals of mass units corresponding to loss of ch groups
alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds
they only reacts with the strongest of electrophilic reagents by virtue of their strong c h bonds and c c bonds
they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals
this inertness is the source of the term paraffins
in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years
the acid dissociation constant values of all alkanes are estimated to range from to depending on the extrapolation method hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases
they are also extremely weak bases undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions
thus a mixture of antimony pentafluoride and fluorosulfonic acid called magic acid can protonate alkanes
all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases
the general equation for complete combustion is see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data
the standard enthalpy change of combustion ch for alkanes increases by about kj mol per ch group
branched chain alkanes have lower values of ch than straight chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable
some organisms are capable of metalbolizing alkanes
the methane monooxygenases convert methane to methanol
for higher alkanes cytochrome p convert alkanes to alcohols which are then susceptible to degradation
free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes
free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes
the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms
the reaction of alkanes and fluorine is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion
these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons
there are three steps experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction
the mixture produced however is not statistical secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free radicals
an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide and chlorine convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides under the influence of light
under some conditions alkanes will undergo nitration
certain transition metal complexes promote non radical reactions with alkanes resulting in so c h bond activation reactions
cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones
this reaction requires heat and catalysts
the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free radicals
the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts which promote a heterolytic breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation
carbon localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement c c scission in position beta and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer
in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a self propagating chain mechanism
the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination
dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes
isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst
in isomerization the alkanes become branched chain isomers
in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight
in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a by product
both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance
butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers
in steam reforming alkanes react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen and carbon monoxide
alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
titan a satellite of saturn was examined by the huygens probe which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface
also on titan the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane ethane lakes near the polar regions of titan
methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake
chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules
alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites
traces of methane gas occur in the earths atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants
the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil
natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons
these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form
natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields
they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced
the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis
alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures methane can co crystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate
although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together
methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels
aside from petroleum and natural gas alkanes occur significantly in nature only as methane which is produced by some archaea by the process of methanogenesis
these organisms are found in the gut of termites and cows
the methane is produced from carbon dioxide or other organic compounds
energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way
a triprotic acid can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka ka ka
an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid usually just called phosphoric acid
all three protons can be successively lost to yield hpo then hpo and finally po the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate
even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged
an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion
although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution
the fractional concentration for each species can be calculated
for example a generic diprotic acid will generate species in solution ha ha and a
the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k and k is known as a bjerrum plot
a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times where k and the other k terms are the dissociation constants for the acid
neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid
it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction
neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt
an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia
conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt
in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid
the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form
in lower ph solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form
solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions
to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution an acid base titration is commonly performed
a strong base solution with a known concentration usually naoh or koh is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added
the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes with the base volume on the x axis and the solutions ph value on the y axis
the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution
for each diprotic acid titration curve from left to right there are two midpoints two equivalence points and two buffer regions
due to the successive dissociation processes there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid
the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated
in other words the amount of oh added equals the original amount of ha at the first equivalence point
the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated
therefore the amount of oh added equals twice the amount of ha at this time
for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base the second equivalence point must occur at ph above due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution
at either equivalence point adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system
a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where phpka
since there are two different ka values the first midpoint occurs at phpka and the second one occurs at phpka
each segment of the curve that contains a midpoint at its center is called the buffer region
because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points
acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in modern industry
sulfuric acid a diprotic acid is the most widely used acid in industry and is also the most produced industrial chemical in the world
it is mainly used in producing fertilizer detergent batteries and dyes as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities
according to the statistics data in the annual production of sulfuric acid was around million tonnes in the world
for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning
in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts
for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer
additionally carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols to produce esters
acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling
they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery
tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind
natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids
citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits
oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid
ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla lemon citrus fruits and guava
many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives
phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks
acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar
citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles
carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks
during the manufacturing process co is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid
carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co at room temperature and pressure
therefore when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co bubbles come out
certain acids are used as drugs
acetylsalicylic acid is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers
acids play important roles in the human body
the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules
amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues
fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues
nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes
carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body
human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors
many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins
other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the bodys ph from undergoing large scale changes that would be harmful to cells
the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies
acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline
some acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions
in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis
many biologically important molecules are acids
nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna
nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring
dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits
cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids
an amino acid has a central carbon that is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group an amino group a hydrogen atom and a variable group
the variable group also called the r group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid
in glycine the simplest amino acid the r group is a hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen
with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the
peptidoglycan found in some bacterial cell walls contains some d amino acids
at physiological ph typically around free amino acids exist in a charged form where the acidic carboxyl group loses a proton and the basic amine group gains a proton
the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains
aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for a net charge of at physiological ph
fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology
these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end
the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups
membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acid base reactions
in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive pro enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin
some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid
acid base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing
oxygen gas drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide as a byproduct
oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation
for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing co into the blood stream
in aqueous solutions such as blood co exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion
it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co and resupplying the cells with o
a sulfonic acid has the general formula rs oh where r is an organic radical
a carboxylic acid has the general formula r coh where r is an organic radical
the carboxyl group coh contains a carbonyl group co and a hydroxyl group o h
halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid
normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group
in vinylogous carboxylic acids a carbon carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups
bitumen is an immensely viscous constituent of petroleum
depending on its exact composition it can be a sticky black liquid or an apparently solid mass that behaves as a liquid over very large time scales
in american english the material is commonly referred to as asphalt
whether found in natural deposits or refined from petroleum the substance is classed as a pitch
prior to the th century the term asphaltum was in general use
the word derives from the ancient greek word which referred to natural bitumen or pitch
the largest natural deposit of bitumen in the world is the pitch lake of southwest trinidad which is estimated to contain million tons
about of annual bitumen production is destined for road construction its primary use
in this application bitumen is used to bind aggregate particles like gravel and forms a substance referred to as asphalt concrete which is colloquially termed asphalt
its other main uses lie in bituminous waterproofing products such as roofing felt and roof sealant
in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably and refer both to natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common
worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material
for the manufactured material which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world however in american english asphalt is more commonly used
to help avoid confusion the terms liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the us to distinguish it from asphalt concrete
colloquially various forms of bitumen are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits
naturally occurring bitumen is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen
its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen
the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands which cover an area larger than england
the latin word traces to the proto indo european root pitch
the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit where we find the words jatu meaning pitch and jatu krit meaning pitch creating pitch producing
the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitu men and by others pixtumens which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english
from the same root is derived the anglo saxon word cwidu the german word kitt and the old norse word kvada
the word aphalt is claimed to have been derived from the accadian term asphaltu or sphallo meaning to split
it was later adopted by the homeric greeks in the form of the adjective signifying firm stable secure and the corresponding verb meaning to make firm or stable to secure
the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek a word meaning asphalt bitumen pitch which perhaps derives from not without ie the alpha privative and to cause to fall baffle err be balked of
the first use of asphalt by the ancients was as a cement to secure or join various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application
specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall
from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french and english
in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt soaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads
bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today
in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen
however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete
in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product
diluted bitumen is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit
bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi solid form of petroleum
bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen
the oil sands of alberta canada are a similar material
neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars
tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested
the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined in long chains in the absence of oxygen
bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid
it may even be mixed in with coal deposits
bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around
bitumen typically contains elementally by weight of carbon hydrogen up to sulfur and molecularly between and by weight of asphaltenes dispersed in to maltenes
most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds nickel and vanadium are found at by intrauterine instillation and by other
according to the cdc due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion
the guttmacher institute estimated there were intact dilation and extraction procedures in the us during this accounts for there are both medical and non medical reasons to have an abortion later in pregnancy
a study was conducted from to at the university of california san francisco where more than women were asked about why they experienced delays in obtaining abortion care if there were any
this study found that almost half of individuals who obtained an abortion after weeks did not suspect that they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy
other barriers to abortion care found in the study included lack of information about where to access an abortion difficulties with transportation lack of insurance coverage and inability to pay for the abortion procedure
medical reasons for seeking an abortion later in pregnancy include fetal anomalies and health risk to the pregnant person
there are diagnostic tests that can diagnose down syndrome or cystic fibrosis as early as weeks into gestation but structural fetal anomalies are often detected much later in pregnancy
a proportion of structural fetal anomalies are lethal which means that the fetus will almost certainly die before or shortly after birth
life threatening conditions may also develop later in pregnancy such as early severe preeclampsia newly diagnosed cancer in need of urgent treatment and intrauterine infection which often occurs along with premature rupture of the amniotic sac
if serious medical conditions such as these arise before the fetus is viable the person carrying the pregnancy may pursue an abortion to preserve their own health
the reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world
some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child domestic violence lack of support feeling they are too young and the wish to complete education or advance a career
additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest
some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures
these might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race disapproval of single or early motherhood stigmatization of people with disabilities insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control
these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex selective abortion
in cultures where there is a preference for male children some women have sex selective abortions which have partially replaced the earlier practice of female infanticide
an additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in of countries and about of women in a further of these countries
in the us the supreme court decisions in roe v
wade and doe v
bolton ruled that the states interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother
even after the point of viability the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman
under the right of privacy physicians must be free to use their medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother
on the same day that the court decided roe it also decided doe v
bolton in which the court defined health very broadly the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the well being of the patient
all these factors may relate to health
this allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment
public opinion shifted in america following television personality sherri finkbines discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to thalidomide
unable to obtain a legal abortion in the united states she traveled to sweden
from to an outbreak of german measles left babies with severe birth defects
in the american medical association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws
a national opinion research center poll in showed supported abortion when the mothers life was at risk when birth defects were present and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest
the rate of cancer during pregnancy is and in many cases cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment
this is particularly true for cervical cancer the most common type of which occurs in of every pregnancies for which initiation of treatment cannot co exist with preservation of fetal life
very early stage cervical cancers may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection radiation therapy or both while later stages are treated by radiotherapy
chemotherapy may be used simultaneously
treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless late term pregnancy allows follow up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth
exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus with higher risks for multiple drug treatments
treatment with more than gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion
exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester especially to weeks of development can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight
exposures above gy cause a dose dependent reduction in iq
it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus
the process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk
according to li et al
aginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels haemorrhage cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non surgical treatment
since ancient times abortions have been done using a number of methods including herbal medicines acting as abortifacients sharp tools through the use of force or through other traditional medicine methods
induced abortion has a long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as ancient china ancient india since its vedic age ancient egypt with its ebers papyrus and the roman empire in the time of juvenal
one of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at angkor wat
found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion
in judaism the fetus is not considered to have a human soul until it is safely outside of the woman is viable and has taken its first breath
the fetus is considered valuable property of the woman and not a human life while in the womb
while judaism encourages people to be fruitful and multiply by having children abortion is allowed and is deemed necessary when a pregnant womans life is in danger
several religions including judaism which disagree that human life begins at conception support the legality of abortion on religious freedom grounds
in islam abortion is traditionally permitted until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fetus considered by various theologians to be at conception days after conception days after conception or at quickening
abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa
some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hippocratic oath forbade physicians in ancient greece from performing abortions other scholars disagree with this interpretation and state that the medical texts of hippocratic corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the oath
the physician scribonius largus wrote in ce that the hippocratic oath prohibits abortion as did soranus of ephesus although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time
according to soranus st or nd century ce work gynaecology one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the hippocratic oath the other party to which he belonged was willing to prescribe abortions only for the sake of the mothers health
in politics aristotle condemned infanticide as a means of population control
he preferred abortion in such cases with the restriction that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive
in the catholic church opinion was divided on how serious abortion was in comparison with such acts as contraception oral sex and sex in marriage for pleasure rather than procreation
the catholic church did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the th century
as early as ce the didache taught that abortion was sinful
several historians argue that prior to the th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before quickening or ensoulment as an abortion
among these authors were the doctors of the church such as st
augustine st
thomas aquinas and st
alphonsus liguori
in pope sixtus v was the only pope before pope pius ix to institute a church policy labeling all abortion as homicide and condemning abortion regardless of the stage of pregnancy
sixtus vs pronouncement was reversed in by pope gregory xiv
in the recodification of code of canon law apostolicae sedis was strengthened in part to remove a possible reading that excluded excommunication of the mother
statements made in the catechism of the catholic church the codified summary of the churchs teachings considers abortion from the moment of conception as homicide and called for the end of legal abortion
denominations that support abortion rights with some limits include the united methodist church episcopal church evangelical lutheran church in america and presbyterian church usa
a guttmacher survey of abortion patients in the united states found that many reported a religious affiliation were catholic while were protestant
a survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy protestants are less likely to do so and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so
a pew research center study found that most christian denominations were against overturning roe v
wade which in the united states legalized abortion at around except white evangelicals at
abortion has been a fairly common practice and was not always illegal or controversial until the th century
under common law including early english common law dating back to edward coke in abortion was generally permitted before quickening and at womens discretion it was whether abortion was performed after quickening that determined if it was a crime
in europe and north america abortion techniques advanced starting in the th century the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques
other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services and they were not widely regulated until the th century when the practice sometimes called restellism was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom
some th century physicians one of the most famous and consequential being the american horatio storer argued for anti abortion laws on racist and misogynist as well as moral grounds
church groups were also highly influential in anti abortion movements and religious groups more so since the th century
some of the early anti abortion laws punished only the doctor or abortionist and while women could be criminally tried for a self induced abortion they were rarely prosecuted in general
in the united states some argued that abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer
others maintain that in the th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe
several scholars argue that despite improved medical procedures the period from the s until the s saw more zealous enforcement of anti abortion laws alongside an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime
in soviet russia became the first country to legalize abortion after lenin insisted that no woman be forced to give birth
iceland and sweden would follow suit to legalize certain or all forms of abortion
in nazi germany a law permitted abortions for those deemed hereditarily ill while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions
beginning in the second half of the th century abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries
in japan abortion was first legalized by the eugenics protection law meant to prevent the births of inferior humans
due to japans continuing strongly patriarchal culture and traditional views on womens societal roles women who want an abortion must normally get written permission from their partner
induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate
ethical moral philosophical biological religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems
opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights governmental authority and womens rights
in both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or the justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion
the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated
abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions
groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion including complete prohibition most often describe themselves as pro life while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as pro choice
current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse
religious moral and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world
the right to life the right to liberty the right to security of person and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws
in jurisdictions where abortion is legal certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion
these requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus often using a trimester based system to regulate the window of legality or as in the us on a doctors evaluation of the fetus viability
some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion
other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus father before aborting the fetus that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure sometimes including risks not supported by the medical literature and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary
many restrictions are waived in emergency situations
china which has ended their one child policy and now has a three child policy has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy
other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely
many but not all of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances
these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest the fetus development is impaired the womans physical or mental well being is endangered or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship
in countries where abortion is banned entirely such as nicaragua medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies
some countries such as bangladesh that nominally ban abortion may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene
this is also a terminology in traditional medicine
in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies
women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves
the organization women on waves has been providing education about medical abortions since
the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws
because the ships are registered in the netherlands dutch law prevails when the ship is in international waters
while in port the organization provides free workshops and education while in international waters medical personnel are legally able to prescribe medical abortion drugs and counseling
sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth
the development of this technology has led to sex selective abortion or the termination of a fetus based on its sex
the selective termination of a female fetus is most common
sex selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries
the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan south korea india and china
this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex selective abortion or even sex screening
in china a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the one child policy which was enacted in
many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex selective abortion
at the international conference on population and development in over states agreed to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in
the world health organization and unicef along with other united nations agencies have found that measures to restrict access to abortion in an effort to reduce sex selective abortions have unintended negative consequences largely stemming from the fact that women may seek or be coerced into seeking unsafe extralegal abortions
on the other hand measures to reduce gender inequality can reduce the prevalence of such abortions without attendant negative consequences
in a number of cases abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence including murder attempted murder kidnapping stalking assault arson and bombing
anti abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism
in the us and canada over incidents of violence trespassing and death threats have been recorded by providers since including over bombings arsons and hundreds of assaults
the majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts
in the united states four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered david gunn john britton barnett slepian and george tiller
also murdered in the us and australia have been other personnel at abortion clinics including receptionists and security guards such as james barrett shannon lowney lee ann nichols and robert sanderson
woundings and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada
hundreds of bombings arsons acid attacks invasions and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred
notable perpetrators of anti abortion violence include eric robert rudolph scott roeder shelley shannon and paul jennings hill the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider
legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal
these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction vandalism picketing and other actions or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment
far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure
in chris danze organized anti abortion organizations throughout texas to prevent the construction of a planned parenthood facility in austin
the organizations released the personal information online of those involved with construction sent them up to phone calls a day and contacted their churches
some protestors record women entering clinics on camera
spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals
for example in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs
in cows abortion may be caused by contagious disease such as brucellosis or campylobacter but can often be controlled by vaccination
eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows
several plants including broomweed skunk cabbage poison hemlock and tree tobacco are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats
in horses a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has lethal white syndrome
foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth
in many species of sharks and rays stress induced abortions occur frequently on capture
viral infection can cause abortion in dogs
cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons including hormonal imbalance
a combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats especially in trap neuter return programs to prevent unwanted kittens from being born
female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy known as the bruce effect
abortion may also be induced in animals in the context of animal husbandry
for example abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant or that are pregnant with twin foals
feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation although the frequency in the wild has been questioned
male gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover causing miscarriage

the american revolutionary war also known as the revolutionary war or american war of independence was a military conflict that was part of the broader american revolution where american patriot forces organized as the continental army and commanded by george washington defeated the british army
during the war american patriot forces had the support of france and spain as well as the dutch republic while the british and loyalist forces hired hessian soldiers from germany for assistance
the conflict was fought in north america the caribbean and the atlantic ocean
the war ended with the treaty of paris in which resulted in great britain ultimately recognizing the independence and sovereignty of the united states
the american colonies were established by royal charter in the th and th centuries
after the british empire gained dominance in north america with victory over the french in the seven years war in tensions and disputes arose between britain and the thirteen colonies over a variety of issues including the stamp and townshend acts
the resulting british military occupation led to the boston massacre in which strengthened american patriots desire for independence from britain
among further tensions the british parliament imposed the intolerable acts in mid
a british attempt to disarm the americans and the resulting battles of lexington and concord in april ignited the war
in june the second continental congress formalized patriot militias into the continental army and appointed washington its commander in chief
the british parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in august
the stakes of the war were formalized with passage of the lee resolution by the congress in philadelphia on july and the unanimous ratification of the declaration of independence two days later on july
after a successful siege washingtons forces drove the british army out of boston in march and british commander in chief william howe responded by launching the new york and new jersey campaign
howe captured new york city in november
washington responded by clandestinely crossing the delaware river and winning small but significant victories at trenton and princeton which restored patriot confidence
in the summer of as howe was poised to capture philadelphia the continental congress fled to baltimore
in october a separate northern british force under the command of john burgoyne was forced to surrender at saratoga in an american victory that proved crucial in convincing france and spain that an independent united states was a viable possibility
after saratoga france signed a commercial agreement with the rebels followed by a treaty of alliance in february
in the sullivan expedition undertook a scorched earth campaign against the iroquois who were largely allied with the british
indian raids on the american frontier however continued to be a problem
also in spain allied with france against britain in the treaty of aranjuez though spain did not formally ally with the americans
howes replacement henry clinton intended to take the war against the americans into the south
despite some initial success british general cornwallis was besieged by a franco american force in yorktown in september and october
cornwallis was forced to surrender in october
the british wars with france and spain continued for another two years but fighting largely ceased in america
in april the north ministry was replaced by a new british government which accepted american independence and began negotiating the treaty of paris ratified on september
britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the united states of america bringing the american revolutionary war to an end
the treaties of versailles resolved britains conflicts with france and spain and forced great britain to cede tobago senegal and small territories in india to france and menorca west florida and east florida to spain
the french and indian war part of the wider global conflict known as the seven years war ended with the peace of paris which expelled france from their possessions in new france
acquisition of territories in atlantic canada and west florida inhabited largely by french or spanish speaking catholics led british authorities to consolidate their hold by populating them with english speaking settlers
preventing conflict between settlers and indian tribes west of the appalachian mountains also avoided the cost of an expensive military occupation
the royal proclamation of was designed to achieve these aims by refocusing colonial expansion north into nova scotia and south into florida with the mississippi river as the dividing line between british and spanish possessions in america
settlement was tightly restricted beyond the limits and claims west of this line including by virginia and massachusetts were rescinded despite the fact that each colony argued that their boundaries extended from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean
the vast exchange of territory ultimately destabilized existing alliances and trade networks between settlers and indians in the west while it proved impossible to prevent encroachment beyond the proclamation line
with the exception of virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them
many settlers resented the restrictions entirely and enforcement required permanent garrisons along the frontier which led to increasingly bitter disputes over who should pay for them
although directly administered by the crown acting through a local governor the colonies were largely governed by native born property owners
while external affairs were managed by london colonial militia were funded locally but with the ending of the french threat in the legislatures expected less taxation not more
at the same time the huge debt incurred by the seven years war and demands from british taxpayers for cuts in government expenditure meant parliament expected the colonies to fund their own defense
the to grenville ministry instructed the royal navy to cease trading smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in american ports
the most important was the molasses act routinely ignored before it had a significant economic impact since of new england rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses
these measures were followed by the sugar act and stamp act which imposed additional taxes on the colonies to pay for defending the western frontier
in july the whigs formed the first rockingham ministry which repealed the stamp act and reduced tax on foreign molasses to help the new england economy but re asserted parliamentary authority in the declaratory act
however this did little to end the discontent in a riot started in boston when the authorities seized the sloop liberty on suspicion of smuggling
tensions escalated further in march when british troops fired on rock throwing civilians killing five in what became known as the boston massacre
the massacre coincided with the partial repeal of the townshend acts by the tory based north ministry which came to power in january and remained in office until
north insisted on retaining duty on tea to enshrine parliaments right to tax the colonies the amount was minor but ignored the fact it was that very principle americans found objectionable
tensions escalated following the destruction of a customs vessel in the june gaspee affair then came to a head in
a banking crisis led to the near collapse of the east india company which dominated the british economy to support it parliament passed the tea act giving it a trading monopoly in the thirteen colonies
since most american tea was smuggled by the dutch the act was opposed by those who managed the illegal trade while being seen as yet another attempt to impose the principle of taxation by parliament
in december a group called the sons of liberty disguised as mohawk natives dumped crates of tea into the boston harbor an event later known as the boston tea party
the british parliament responded by passing the so called intolerable acts aimed specifically at massachusetts although many colonists and members of the whig opposition considered them a threat to liberty in general
this led to increased sympathy for the patriot cause locally in the british parliament and in the london press
throughout the th century the elected lower houses in the colonial legislatures gradually wrested power from their royal governors
dominated by smaller landowners and merchants these assemblies now established ad hoc provincial legislatures variously called congresses conventions and conferences effectively replacing royal control
with the exception of georgia twelve colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress to agree on a unified response to the crisis
many of the delegates feared that an all out boycott would result in war and sent a petition to the king calling for the repeal of the intolerable acts
however after some debate on september congress endorsed the massachusetts suffolk resolves and on october passed the continental association based on a draft prepared by the first virginia convention in august the association instituted economic sanctions and a full boycott of goods against britain
while denying its authority over internal american affairs a faction led by james duane and future loyalist joseph galloway insisted congress recognize parliaments right to regulate colonial trade
expecting concessions by the north administration congress authorized the extralegal committees and conventions of the colonial legislatures to enforce the boycott this succeeded in reducing british imports by from to
however on february parliament declared massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and instituted a blockade of the colony
in july the restraining acts limited colonial trade with the british west indies and britain and barred new england ships from the newfoundland cod fisheries
the increase in tension led to a scramble for control of militia stores which each assembly was legally obliged to maintain for defense
on april a british attempt to secure the concord arsenal culminated in the battles of lexington and concord which began the revolutionary war
after the patriot victory at concord moderates in congress led by john dickinson drafted the olive branch petition offering to accept royal authority in return for george iii mediating in the dispute
however since the petition was immediately followed by the declaration of the causes and necessity of taking up arms colonial secretary lord dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere he refused to present the petition to the king which was therefore rejected in early september
although constitutionally correct since george could not oppose his own government it disappointed those americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute while the hostility of his language annoyed even loyalist members of congress
combined with the proclamation of rebellion issued on august in response to the battle at bunker hill it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement
backed by the whigs parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by votes fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the americans towards independence
however by the end of the collapse of british authority meant both lord north and george iii were convinced war was inevitable
after boston gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements the irish parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments while allowing catholics to enlist for the first time
britain also signed a series of treaties with german states to supply additional troops
within a year it had an army of over men in america the largest ever sent outside europe at the time
the employment of german soldiers against people viewed as british citizens was opposed by many in parliament and by the colonial assemblies combined with the lack of activity by gage opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the patriots to take control of the legislatures
support for independence was boosted by thomas paines pamphlet common sense which was published on january and argued for american self government and was widely reprinted
to draft the declaration of independence the second continental congress appointed the committee of five consisting of thomas jefferson john adams benjamin franklin roger sherman and robert livingston
the declaration was written almost exclusively by jefferson who wrote it largely in isolation between june and june in a three story residence at market street in philadelphia
identifying inhabitants of the thirteen colonies as one people the declaration simultaneously dissolved political links with britain while including a long list of alleged violations of english rights committed by george iii
this is also one of the foremost times that the colonies were referred to as united states rather than the more common united colonies
on july congress voted for independence and published the declaration on july which george washington read to his troops in new york city on july
at this point the revolution ceased to be an internal dispute over trade and tax policies and had evolved into a civil war since each state represented in congress was engaged in a struggle with britain but also split between american patriots and american loyalists
patriots generally supported independence from britain and a new national union in congress while loyalists remained faithful to british rule
estimates of numbers vary one suggestion being the population as a whole was split evenly between committed patriots committed loyalists and those who were indifferent
others calculate the split as patriot neutral loyalist but with considerable regional variations
at the onset of the war the second continental congress realized defeating britain required foreign alliances and intelligence gathering
the committee of secret correspondence was formed for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in great britain and other parts of the world
from to the committee shared information and built alliances through secret correspondence as well as employing secret agents in europe to gather intelligence conduct undercover operations analyze foreign publications and initiate patriot propaganda campaigns
paine served as secretary while benjamin franklin and silas deane sent to france to recruit military engineers were instrumental in securing french aid in paris
the revolutionary war included two principal campaign theaters within the thirteen colonies and a smaller but strategically important third one west of the appalachian mountains
fighting began in the northern theater and was at its most severe from to
american patriots achieved several strategic victories in the south
the americans defeated the british army at saratoga in october and the french seeing the possibility for an american patriot victory in the war formally entered the war as an american ally
during washington prevented the british army from breaking out of new york city while militia under george rogers clark conquered western quebec supported by francophone settlers and their indian allies which became the northwest territory
the war became a stalemate in the north in so the british initiated their southern strategy which aimed to mobilize loyalist support in the region and occupy american patriot controlled territory north to chesapeake bay
the campaign was initially successful with the british capture of charleston being a major setback for southern patriots however a franco american force surrounded the british army at yorktown and their surrender in october effectively ended fighting in america
on april sir thomas gage commander in chief north america since and also governor of massachusetts from received orders to take action against the patriots
he decided to destroy militia ordnance stored at concord massachusetts and capture john hancock and samuel adams who were considered the principal instigators of the rebellion
the operation was to begin around midnight on april in the hope of completing it before the american patriots could respond
however paul revere learned of the plan and notified captain parker commander of the concord militia who prepared to resist the attempted seizure
the first action of the war commonly referred to as the shot heard round the world was a brief skirmish at lexington followed by the full scale battles of lexington and concord
british troops suffered around casualties before withdrawing to boston which was then besieged by the militia
in may british reinforcements arrived under generals william howe john burgoyne and sir henry clinton
on june they seized the charlestown peninsula at the battle of bunker hill a frontal assault in which they suffered over casualties
dismayed at the costly attack which had gained them little gage appealed to london for a larger army to suppress the revolt but instead was replaced as commander by howe
on june congress took control of american patriot forces outside boston and congressional leader john adams nominated washington as commander in chief of the newly formed continental army
washington previously commanded virginia militia regiments in the french and indian war and on june hancock officially proclaimed him general and commander in chief of the army of the united colonies
he assumed command on july preferring to fortify dorchester heights outside boston rather than assaulting it
in early march colonel henry knox arrived with heavy artillery acquired in the capture of fort ticonderoga
under cover of darkness on march washington placed these on dorchester heights from where they could fire on the town and british ships in boston harbor
fearing another bunker hill howe evacuated the city on march without further loss and sailed to halifax nova scotia while washington moved south to new york city
beginning in august american privateers raided towns in nova scotia including saint john charlottetown and yarmouth
in john paul jones and jonathan eddy attacked canso and fort cumberland respectively
british officials in quebec began negotiating with the iroquois for their support while us envoys urged them to remain neutral
aware of native american leanings toward the british and fearing an anglo indian attack from canada congress authorized a second invasion in april
after the defeat at the battle of quebec on december the americans maintained a loose blockade of the city until they retreated on may
a second defeat at trois rivires on june ended operations in quebec
british pursuit was initially blocked by american naval vessels on lake champlain until victory at valcour island on october forced the americans to withdraw to fort ticonderoga while in december an uprising in nova scotia sponsored by massachusetts was defeated at fort cumberland
these failures impacted public support for the patriot cause and aggressive anti loyalist policies in the new england colonies alienated the canadians
in virginia an attempt by governor lord dunmore to seize militia stores on april led to an increase in tension although conflict was avoided for the time being
this changed after the publication of dunmores proclamation on november promising freedom to any slaves who fled their patriot masters and agreed to fight for the crown
british forces were defeated at great bridge on december and took refuge on british ships anchored near the port of norfolk
when the third virginia convention refused to disband its militia or accept martial law dunmore ordered the burning of norfolk on january
the siege of savages old fields began on november in south carolina between loyalist and patriot militias and the loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony in the snow campaign
loyalists were recruited in north carolina to reassert british rule in the south but they were decisively defeated in the battle of moores creek bridge
a british expedition sent to reconquer south carolina launched an attack on charleston in the battle of sullivans island on june but it failed and left the south under patriot control until
a shortage of gunpowder led congress to authorize a naval expedition against the bahamas to secure ordnance stored there
on march an american squadron under the command of esek hopkins landed at the east end of nassau and encountered minimal resistance at fort montagu
hopkins troops then marched on fort nassau
hopkins had promised governor montfort browne and the civilian inhabitants of the area that their lives and property would not be in any danger if they offered no resistance to which they complied
hopkins captured large stores of powder and other munitions that was so great he had to impress an extra ship in the harbor to transport the supplies back home when he departed on march
a month later after a brief skirmish with they returned to new london connecticut the base for american naval operations during the revolution
after regrouping at halifax in nova scotia howe was determined to take the fight to the americans
he set sail for new york in june and began landing troops on staten island near the entrance to new york harbor on july
the americans rejected howes informal attempt to negotiate peace on july washington knew that an attack on the city was imminent and realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined british regular troops
on august patriot thomas knowlton was given orders to form an elite group for reconnaissance and secret missions
knowltons rangers which included nathan hale became the armys first intelligence unit
when washington was driven off long island he soon realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the british
he was committed to professionalizing military intelligence
with aid from benjamin tallmadge washington launched the six man culper spy ring
the efforts of washington and the culper spy ring substantially increased the effective allocation and deployment of continental regiments in the field
throughout the war washington spent more than percent of his total military funds on military intelligence operations
washington split the continental army into positions on manhattan and across the east river in western long island
on august at the battle of long island howe outflanked washington and forced him back to brooklyn heights but he did not attempt to encircle washingtons forces
through the night of august knox bombarded the british
knowing they were up against overwhelming odds washington ordered the assembly of a war council on august all agreed to retreat to manhattan
washington quickly had his troops assembled and ferried them across the east river to manhattan on flat bottomed freight boats without any losses in men or ordnance leaving general thomas mifflins regiments as a rearguard
howe met with a delegation from the second continental congress at the september staten island peace conference but it failed to conclude peace largely because the british delegates only had the authority to offer pardons and could not recognize independence
on september howe seized control of new york city when the british landed at kips bay and unsuccessfully engaged the americans at the battle of harlem heights the following day
on october howe failed to encircle the americans at the battle of pells point and the americans withdrew
howe declined to close with washingtons army on october at the battle of white plains and instead attacked a hill that was of no strategic value
washingtons retreat isolated his remaining forces and the british captured fort washington on november
the british victory there amounted to washingtons most disastrous defeat with the loss of prisoners
the remaining american regiments on long island fell back four days later
general henry clinton wanted to pursue washingtons disorganized army but he was first required to commit troops to capture newport rhode island to secure the loyalist port
general charles cornwallis pursued washington but howe ordered him to halt leaving washington unmolested
the outlook following the defeat at fort washington appeared bleak for the american cause
the reduced continental army had dwindled to fewer than men and was reduced further when enlistments expired at the end of the year
popular support wavered and morale declined
on december the continental congress abandoned the revolutionary capital of philadelphia and moved to baltimore where it remained for over two months until february
loyalist activity surged in the wake of the american defeat especially in new york state
in london news of the victorious long island campaign was well received with festivities held in the capital
public support reached a peak and king george iii awarded the order of the bath to howe
strategic deficiencies among patriot forces were evident washington divided a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one his inexperienced staff misread the military situation and american troops fled in the face of enemy fire
the successes led to predictions that the british could win within a year
in the meantime the british established winter quarters in the new york city area and anticipated renewed campaigning the following spring
two weeks after congress withdrew to baltimore on the night of december washington crossed the delaware river leading a column of continental army troops from todays bucks county pennsylvania located about miles upriver from philadelphia to todays mercer county new jersey in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation
meanwhile the hessians were involved in numerous clashes with small bands of patriots and were often aroused by false alarms at night in the weeks before the actual battle of trenton
by christmas they were tired and weary while a heavy snowstorm led their commander colonel johann rall to assume no attack of any consequence would occur
at daybreak on the th the american patriots surprised and overwhelmed rall and his troops who lost over killed including rall while prisoners german cannons and much supply were captured
the battle of trenton restored the american armys morale reinvigorated the patriot cause and dispelled their fear of what they regarded as hessian mercenaries
a british attempt to retake trenton was repulsed at assunpink creek on january during the night washington outmaneuvered cornwallis then defeated his rearguard in the battle of princeton the following day
the two victories helped convince the french that the americans were worthy military allies
after his success at princeton washington entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey where he remained until may and received congressional direction to inoculate all patriot troops against smallpox
with the exception of a minor skirmishing between the two armies which continued until march howe made no attempt to attack the americans
the campaign demonstrated that regaining new england would be a prolonged affair which led to a change in british strategy
this involved isolating the north from the rest of the country by taking control of the hudson river allowing them to focus on the south where loyalist support was believed to be substantial
in december howe wrote to the colonial secretary lord germain proposing a limited offensive against philadelphia while a second force moved down the hudson from canada
germain received this on february followed a few days later by a memorandum from burgoyne then in london on leave
burgoyne supplied several alternatives all of which gave him responsibility for the offensive with howe remaining on the defensive
the option selected required him to lead the main force south from montreal down the hudson valley while a detachment under barry st
leger moved east from lake ontario
the two would meet at albany leaving howe to decide whether to join them
reasonable in principle this did not account for the logistical difficulties involved and burgoyne erroneously assumed howe would remain on the defensive germains failure to make this clear meant he opted to attack philadelphia instead
burgoyne set out on june with a mixed force of british regulars professional german soldiers and canadian militia and captured fort ticonderoga on july
as general horatio gates retreated his troops blocked roads destroyed bridges dammed streams and stripped the area of food
this slowed burgoynes progress and forced him to send out large foraging expeditions on one of these more than british troops were captured at the battle of bennington on august
st leger moved east and besieged fort stanwix despite defeating an american relief force at the battle of oriskany on august he was abandoned by his indian allies and withdrew to quebec on august
now isolated and outnumbered by gates burgoyne continued onto albany rather than retreating to fort ticonderoga reaching saratoga on september
he asked clinton for support while constructing defenses around the town
morale among his troops rapidly declined and an unsuccessful attempt to break past gates at the battle of freeman farms on september resulted in british casualties
when clinton advised he could not reach them burgoynes subordinates advised retreat a reconnaissance in force on october was repulsed by gates at the battle of bemis heights forcing them back into saratoga with heavy losses
by october all hope of escape had vanished persistent rain reduced the camp to a squalid hell of mud and starving cattle supplies were dangerously low and many of the wounded in agony
burgoyne capitulated on october around soldiers including german forces commanded by general friedrich adolf riedesel surrendered their arms before being taken to boston where they were to be transported to england
after securing additional supplies howe made another attempt on philadelphia by landing his troops in chesapeake bay on august
he now compounded failure to support burgoyne by missing repeated opportunities to destroy his opponent defeating washington at the battle of brandywine on september then allowing him to withdraw in good order
after dispersing an american detachment at paoli on september cornwallis occupied philadelphia on september with the main force of under howe based just to the north at germantown
washington attacked them on october but was repulsed
to prevent howes forces in philadelphia being resupplied by sea the patriots erected fort mifflin and nearby fort mercer on the east and west banks of the delaware respectively and placed obstacles in the river south of the city
this was supported by a small flotilla of continental navy ships on the delaware supplemented by the pennsylvania state navy commanded by john hazelwood
an attempt by the royal navy to take the forts in the october to battle of red bank failed a second attack captured fort mifflin on november while fort mercer was abandoned two days later when cornwallis breached the walls
his supply lines secured howe tried to tempt washington into giving battle but after inconclusive skirmishing at the battle of white marsh from december to he withdrew to philadelphia for the winter
on december the americans followed suit and entered winter quarters at valley forge while washingtons domestic opponents contrasted his lack of battlefield success with gates victory at saratoga foreign observers such as frederick the great were equally impressed with germantown which demonstrated resilience and determination
over the winter poor conditions supply problems and low morale resulted in deaths with another unfit for duty due to lack of shoes
however baron friedrich wilhelm von steuben took the opportunity to introduce prussian army drill and infantry tactics to the entire continental army he did this by training model companies in each regiment who then instructed their home units
despite valley forge being only twenty miles away howe made no effort to attack their camp an action some critics argue could have ended the war
like his predecessors french foreign minister vergennes considered the peace a national humiliation and viewed the war as an opportunity to weaken britain
he initially avoided open conflict but allowed american ships to take on cargoes in french ports a technical violation of neutrality
although public opinion favored the american cause finance minister turgot argued they did not need french help to gain independence and war was too expensive
instead vergennes persuaded louis xvi to secretly fund a government front company to purchase munitions for the patriots carried in neutral dutch ships and imported through sint eustatius in the caribbean
many americans opposed a french alliance fearing to exchange one tyranny for another but this changed after a series of military setbacks in early
as france had nothing to gain from the colonies reconciling with britain congress had three choices making peace on british terms continuing the struggle on their own or proclaiming independence guaranteed by france
although the declaration of independence in july had wide public support adams was among those reluctant to pay the price of an alliance with france and over of congressmen voted against it
congress agreed to the treaty with reluctance and as the war moved in their favor increasingly lost interest in it
silas deane was sent to paris to begin negotiations with vergennes whose key objectives were replacing britain as the united states primary commercial and military partner while securing the french west indies from american expansion
these islands were extremely valuable in the value of sugar and coffee produced by saint domingue on its own exceeded that of all american exports combined
talks progressed slowly until october when british defeat at saratoga and their apparent willingness to negotiate peace convinced vergennes only a permanent alliance could prevent the disaster of anglo american rapprochement
assurances of formal french support allowed congress to reject the carlisle peace commission and insist on nothing short of complete independence
on february france and the united states signed the treaty of amity and commerce regulating trade between the two countries followed by a defensive military alliance against britain the treaty of alliance
in return for french guarantees of american independence congress undertook to defend their interests in the west indies while both sides agreed not to make a separate peace conflict over these provisions would lead to the to quasi war
charles iii of spain was invited to join on the same terms but refused largely due to concerns over the impact of the revolution on spanish colonies in the americas
spain had complained on multiple occasions about encroachment by american settlers into louisiana a problem that could only get worse once the united states replaced britain
although spain ultimately made important contributions to american success in the treaty of aranjuez charles agreed only to support frances war with britain outside america in return for help in recovering gibraltar menorca and spanish florida
the terms were confidential since several conflicted with american aims for example the french claimed exclusive control of the newfoundland cod fisheries a non negotiable for colonies like massachusetts
one less well known impact of this agreement was the abiding american distrust of foreign entanglements the us would not sign another treaty with france until their nato agreement of
this was because the us had agreed not to make peace without france while aranjuez committed france to keep fighting until spain recovered gibraltar effectively making it a condition of us independence without the knowledge of congress
to encourage french participation in the struggle for independence the us representative in paris silas deane promised promotion and command positions to any french officer who joined the continental army
such as gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette whom congress via dean appointed a major general on july
when the war started britain tried to borrow the dutch based scots brigade for service in america but pro patriot sentiment led the states general to refuse
although the republic was no longer a major power prior to they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits shipping french supplied munitions to the patriots
this ended when britain declared war in december a conflict that proved disastrous to the dutch economy
the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france
the british government failed to take into account the strength of the american merchant marine and support from european countries which allowed the colonies to import munitions and continue trading with relative impunity
while well aware of this the north administration delayed placing the royal navy on a war footing for cost reasons this prevented the institution of an effective blockade and restricted them to ineffectual diplomatic protests
traditional british policy was to employ european land based allies to divert the opposition a role filled by prussia in the seven years war in they were diplomatically isolated and faced war on multiple fronts
meanwhile george iii had given up on subduing america while britain had a european war to fight
he did not welcome war with france but he believed the british victories over france in the seven years war as a reason to believe in ultimate victory over france
britain could not find a powerful ally among the great powers to engage france on the european continent
britain subsequently changed its focus into the caribbean theater and diverted major military resources away from america
vergenness colleague stated for her honour france had to seize this opportunity to rise from her degradation
if she neglected it if fear overcame duty she would add debasement to humiliation and become an object of contempt to her own century and to all future peoples
at the end of howe resigned and was replaced by sir henry clinton on may with french entry into the war he was ordered to consolidate his forces in new york
on june the british departed philadelphia with the reinvigorated americans in pursuit the battle of monmouth on june was inconclusive but boosted patriot morale
washington had rallied charles lees broken regiments the continentals repulsed british bayonet charges the british rear guard lost perhaps per cent more casualties and the americans held the field at the end of the day
that midnight the newly installed clinton continued his retreat to new york
a french naval force under admiral charles henri hector destaing was sent to assist washington deciding new york was too formidable a target in august they launched a combined attack on newport with general john sullivan commanding land forces
the resulting battle of rhode island was indecisive badly damaged by a storm the french withdrew to avoid putting their ships at risk
further activity was limited to british raids on chestnut neck and little egg harbor in october
in july the americans captured british positions at stony point and paulus hook
clinton unsuccessfully tried to tempt washington into a decisive engagement by sending general william tryon to raid connecticut
in july a large american naval operation the penobscot expedition attempted to retake maine then part of massachusetts but was defeated
persistent iroquois raids in new york and pennsylvania led to the punitive sullivan expedition from july to september
involving more than patriot soldiers the scorched earth campaign destroyed more than iroquois villages and bushels of maize leaving the iroquois destitute and destroying the iroquois confederacy as an independent power on the american frontier
however the military expedition did not result in peace
iroquois fled to canada
supplied and supported by the british they continued their raids
during the winter of the continental army suffered greater hardships than at valley forge
morale was poor public support fell away in the long war the continental dollar was virtually worthless the army was plagued with supply problems desertion was common and mutinies occurred in the pennsylvania line and new jersey line regiments over the conditions in early
in june clinton sent men under wilhelm von knyphausen to retake new jersey but they were halted by local militia at the battle of connecticut farms although the americans withdrew knyphausen felt he was not strong enough to engage washingtons main force and retreated
a second attempt two weeks later ended in a british defeat at the battle of springfield effectively ending their ambitions in new jersey
in july washington appointed benedict arnold commander of west point his attempt to betray the fort to the british failed due to incompetent planning and the plot was revealed when his british contact john andr was captured and later executed
arnold escaped to new york and switched sides an action justified in a pamphlet addressed to the inhabitants of america the patriots condemned his betrayal while he found himself almost as unpopular with the british
the southern strategy was developed by lord germain based on input from london based loyalists including joseph galloway
they argued that it made no sense to fight the patriots in the north where they were strongest while the new england economy was reliant on trade with britain regardless of who governed it
on the other hand duties on tobacco made the south far more profitable for britain while local support meant securing it required small numbers of regular troops
victory would leave a truncated united states facing british possessions in the south canada to the north and ohio on their western border with the atlantic seaboard controlled by the royal navy congress would be forced to agree to terms
however assumptions about the level of loyalist support proved wildly optimistic
germain accordingly ordered augustine prvost the british commander in east florida to advance into georgia in december
lieutenant colonel archibald campbell an experienced officer taken prisoner earlier in the war before being exchanged for ethan allen captured savannah on december
he recruited a loyalist militia of nearly many of whom allegedly joined only after campbell threatened to confiscate their property
poor motivation and training made them unreliable troops as demonstrated in their defeat by patriot militia at the battle of kettle creek on february although this was offset by british victory at brier creek on march
in june prvost launched an abortive assault on charleston before retreating to savannah an operation notorious for widespread looting by british troops that enraged both loyalists and patriots
in october a joint french and american operation under destaing and general benjamin lincoln failed to recapture savannah
prvost was replaced by lord cornwallis who assumed responsibility for germains strategy he soon realized estimates of loyalist support were considerably over stated and he needed far larger numbers of regular forces
reinforced by clinton cornwalliss troops captured charleston in may inflicting the most serious patriot defeat of the war over prisoners were taken and the continental army in the south effectively destroyed
on may lieutenant colonel banastre tarletons mainly loyalist force routed a continental army force nearly three times its size under the command of colonel abraham buford at the battle of waxhaws
the battle is controversial for allegations of a massacre which were later used as a recruiting tool by the patriots
clinton returned to new york leaving cornwallis to oversee the south despite their success the two men left barely on speaking terms with dire consequences for the future conduct of the war
the southern strategy depended on local support but this was undermined by a series of coercive measures
previously captured patriots were sent home after swearing not to take up arms against the king they were now required to fight their former comrades while the confiscation of patriot owned plantations led formerly neutral grandees to side with them
skirmishes at williamsons plantation cedar springs rocky mount and hanging rock signaled widespread resistance to the new oaths throughout south carolina
in july congress appointed gates commander in the south he was defeated at the battle of camden on august leaving cornwallis free to enter north carolina
despite battlefield success the british could not control the countryside and patriot attacks continued before moving north cornwallis sent loyalist militia under major patrick ferguson to cover his left flank leaving their forces too far apart to provide mutual support
in early october ferguson was defeated at the battle of kings mountain dispersing organized loyalist resistance in the region
despite this cornwallis continued into north carolina hoping for loyalist support while washington replaced gates with general nathanael greene in december
greene divided his army leading his main force southeast pursued by cornwallis a detachment was sent southwest under daniel morgan who defeated tarletons british legion at cowpens on january nearly eliminating it as a fighting force
the patriots now held the initiative in the south with the exception of a raid on richmond led by benedict arnold in january
greene led cornwallis on a series of countermarches around north carolina by early march the british were exhausted and short of supplies and greene felt strong enough to fight the battle of guilford court house on march
although victorious cornwallis suffered heavy casualties and retreated to wilmington north carolina seeking supplies and reinforcements
the patriots now controlled most of the carolinas and georgia outside the coastal areas after a minor reversal at the battle of hobkirks hill they recaptured fort watson and fort motte on april
on june brigadier general andrew pickens captured augusta leaving the british in georgia confined to charleston and savannah
the assumption loyalists would do most of the fighting left the british short of troops and battlefield victories came at the cost of losses they could not replace
despite halting greenes advance at the battle of eutaw springs on september cornwallis withdrew to charleston with little to show for his campaign
from the beginning of the war bernardo de glvez the governor of spanish louisiana allowed the americans to import supplies and munitions into new orleans then ship them to pittsburgh
this provided an alternative transportation route for the continental army bypassing the british blockade of the atlantic coast
the trade was organized by oliver pollock a successful merchant in havana and new orleans who was appointed us commercial agent
it also helped support the american campaign in the west
in february an expedition of militia to destroy british military supplies in settlements along the cuyahoga river was halted by adverse weather
later in the year a second campaign was undertaken to seize the illinois country from the british
virginia militia canadien settlers and indian allies commanded by colonel george rogers clark captured kaskaskia on july and then secured vincennes though vincennes was recaptured by quebec governor henry hamilton
in early the virginians counter attacked in the siege of fort vincennes and took hamilton prisoner
clark secured western british quebec as the american northwest territory in the treaty of paris brought the revolutionary war to an end
when spain joined frances war against britain in the anglo french war in their treaty specifically excluded spanish military action in north america
later that year however glvez initiated offensive operations against british outposts
first he cleared british garrisons in louisiana fort bute and natchez mississippi and captured five forts
in doing so glvez opened navigation on the mississippi river north to the american settlement in pittsburgh
on may british colonel henry bird invaded kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear american resistance from quebec to the gulf coast
their pensacola advance on new orleans was repelled by spanish governor glvezs offensive on mobile
simultaneous british attacks were repulsed on st
louis by the spanish lieutenant governor de leyba and on the virginia county courthouse in cahokia illinois by lieutenant colonel clark
the british initiative under bird from detroit was ended at the rumored approach of clark
the scale of violence in the licking river valley was extreme even for frontier standards
it led to english and german settlements who joined clarks militia when the british and their hired german soldiers withdrew to the great lakes
the americans responded with a major offensive along the mad river in august which met with some success in the battle of piqua but did not end indian raids
french soldier augustin de la balme led a canadian militia in an attempt to capture detroit but they dispersed when miami natives led by little turtle attacked the encamped settlers on november
the war in the west stalemated with the british garrison sitting in detroit and the virginians expanding westward settlements north of the ohio river in the face of british allied indian resistance
in galvez and pollock campaigned east along the gulf coast to secure west florida including british held mobile and pensacola
the spanish operations impaired the british supply of armaments to british indian allies which effectively suspended a military alliance to attack settlers between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains
in large scale retaliations between settlers and native americans in the region included the gnadenhutten massacre and the crawford expedition
the battle of blue licks was one of the last major engagements of the american revolutionary war
news of the treaty between great britain and the united states arrived late that year
by this time about of kentucky settlers had been killed in battles against native americans contrasted with of the population killed in the thirteen colonies
lingering resentments led to continued fighting in the west after the war officially ended
clinton spent most of based in new york city he failed to construct a coherent operational strategy partly due to his difficult relationship with admiral marriot arbuthnot
in charleston cornwallis independently developed an aggressive plan for a campaign in virginia which he hoped would isolate greenes army in the carolinas and cause the collapse of patriot resistance in the south
this strategy was approved by lord germain in london but neither of them informed clinton
washington and rochambeau meanwhile discussed their options
washington wanted to attack the british in new york and rochambeau wanted to attack them in virginia where cornwalliss forces were less established and arguably easier to defeat
washington eventually gave way and lafayette took a combined franco american force into virginia but clinton misinterpreted his movements as preparations for an attack on new york
concerned by a perceived threat to his positions in new york he instructed cornwallis to establish a fortified sea base where the royal navy could evacuate british troops to help defend new york
when lafayette entered virginia cornwallis complied with clintons orders and withdrew to yorktown where he constructed strong defenses and awaited evacuation
an agreement by the spanish navy to defend the french west indies allowed admiral franois joseph paul de grasse to relocate to the atlantic seaboard a move arbuthnot did not anticipate
this provided lafayette naval support while the failure of previous combined operations at newport and savannah meant their coordination was planned more carefully
despite repeated urging from his subordinates cornwallis made no attempt to engage lafayette before he could establish siege lines
expecting to be withdrawn within a few days he also abandoned the outer defenses which were promptly occupied by the besiegers and hastened british defeat
on august a royal navy fleet under thomas graves left new york for yorktown
after landing troops and munitions for the besiegers on august de grasse remained in chesapeake bay and intercepted him on september although the battle of the chesapeake was indecisive in terms of losses graves was forced to retreat leaving cornwallis isolated
an attempted breakout over york river at gloucester point failed due to bad weather
under heavy bombardment with dwindling supplies cornwallis felt his situation was hopeless and on october sent emissaries to general washington to negotiate their surrender after twelve hours of negotiations the terms of surrender were finalized the following day
responsibility for defeat was the subject of fierce public debate between cornwallis clinton and germain
despite criticism from his junior officers cornwallis retained the confidence of his peers and later held a series of senior government positions
clinton ultimately took most of the blame and spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity
subsequent to yorktown american forces were assigned to supervise the armistice between washington and clinton made to facilitate british departure following the january law of parliament forbidding any further british offensive action in north america
british american negotiations in paris led to signed preliminary agreements in november which acknowledged us independence
the enacted congressional war objective a british withdrawal from north america and cession of these regions to the us was completed in stages in east coast cities
in the us south generals greene and wayne loosely invested the withdrawing british at savannah and charleston where they observed the british remove their troops from charleston on december
loyalist provincial militias of whites and free blacks and loyalists with slaves were transported to nova scotia and the british west indies
native american allies of the british and some freed blacks were left to escape unaided through the american lines
washington moved his army to new windsor on the hudson river about sixty miles north of new york city and there the substance of the continental army was furloughed home with officers at half pay until the treaty of paris formally ended the war on september
at that time congress decommissioned the regiments of washingtons continental army and began issuing land grants to veterans in the northwest territory for their war service
the last british occupation of new york city ended on november with the departure of clintons replacement general sir guy carleton
to win their insurrection washington and the continental army needed to outlast the british will to continue the fight
to restore their british america empire the british had to defeat the continental army in the early months and compel second continental congress in philadelphia to dissolve and retract its claim to self governance
historian terry m
mays of the citadel identifies three separate types of warfare during the revolutionary war
the first was a colonial conflict in which objections to imperial trade regulation were as significant as taxation policy
the second was a civil war with all thirteen colonies split between american patriots american loyalists and those who preferred to remain neutral in the revolution and war
particularly in the south many battles were fought between patriots and loyalists with no british involvement leading to divisions that continued after independence was achieved
the third element was a global war between france spain the dutch republic and britain with america serving as one of several different war theaters
after entering the revolutionary war in france provided the americans money weapons soldiers and naval assistance while french troops fought under us command in north america
while spain did not formally join the war in america they provided access to the mississippi river and captured british possessions on the gulf of mexico that denied bases to the royal navy retook menorca and besieged gibraltar in europe
although the dutch republic was no longer a major power prior to they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits by shipping french supplied munitions to the patriots
this ended when britain declared war in december and the conflict proved disastrous to the dutch economy
the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march that protected neutral ships from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france
while of limited effect these interventions forced the british to divert men and resources away from north america
the second continental congress meeting in philadelphia stood to benefit if the american revolution evolved into a protracted war
their thirteen colonial state populations were largely prosperous and depended on local production for food and supplies rather than on imports from britain which took six to twelve weeks to arrive by cross atlantic shipping
the thirteen colonies were spread across most of north american atlantic seaboard stretching miles
most colonial farms were remote from the seaports and control of four or five major ports did not give britain control over american inland areas
each state had established internal distribution systems
each of the thirteen colonies also had a long established system of local militia which were combat tested in support of british regulars thirteen years before to secure an expanded british empire
together these militias denied frances claims to north america west of the mississippi river in the french and indian war
the thirteen colonial state legislatures independently funded and controlled their local militias
in the american revolution they trained and provided continental line regiments to the regular army each with their own state officer corps
motivation was also a major asset each colonial capital had its own newspapers and printers and the patriots enjoyed more popular support than the loyalists
britain hoped that the loyalists would do much of the fighting but found that the loyalists did not engage as significantly as they had hoped
when the revolutionary war began the second continental congress lacked a professional army or navy but each colony maintained local militias
militiamen were lightly armed had little training and usually did not have uniforms
their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time and lacked the training and discipline of more experienced soldiers
local county militias were reluctant to travel far from home and they were unavailable for extended operations
to compensate for this the continental congress established a regular force known as the continental army on june which proved to be the origin of the modern united states army and appointed washington as its commander in chief
however it suffered significantly from the lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants offset by a few senior officers
each state legislature appointed officers for both county and state militias and their regimental continental line officers although washington was required to accept congressional appointments he was still permitted to choose and command his own generals such as greene his chief of artillery knox and alexander hamilton the chief of staff
one of washingtons most successful general officer recruits was steuben a veteran of the prussian general staff who wrote the revolutionary war drill manual
the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington used both his regulars and state militias throughout the war when properly employed the combination allowed them to overwhelm smaller british forces as they did in battles at concord boston bennington and saratoga
both sides used partisan warfare but the state militias effectively suppressed loyalist activity when british regulars were not in the area
washington designed the overall military strategy of the revolutionary war in cooperation with congress established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs personally recruited his senior officer corps and kept the states focused on a common goal
for the first three years until after fall of philadelphia and the six month encampment at valley forge the continental army was largely supplemented by local state militias
washington initially employed the inexperienced officers and untrained troops in fabian strategies rather than risk frontal assaults against britains professional soldiers and officers
over the course of the entire war washington lost more battles than he won but he never surrendered his troops and maintained a fighting force in the face of british field armies and never gave up fighting for the american cause
by prevailing european standards the armies in america were relatively small limited by lack of supplies and logistics
the british were constrained by the logistical difficulty of transporting troops across the atlantic and their dependence on local supplies
throughout the war washington never directly commanded more than men and the combined franco american army in the decisive american victory at yorktown was only about
at the beginning of patriot forces consisted of men with two thirds of them in the continental army and the other third in the various state militias
about american men served as regulars or as militia for the revolutionary cause over eight years during wartime but there were never more than men under arms at any time
on the whole american officers never equaled their british opponents in tactics and maneuvers and they lost most of the pitched battles
the great successes at boston saratoga and yorktown were won by trapping the british far from base with a greater number of troops
after however washingtons army was transformed into a more disciplined and effective force mostly as a product of baron von steubens military training
immediately after the continental army emerged from valley forge in june it proved its ability to match the military capabilities of the british at the battle of monmouth including a black rhode island regiment fending off a british bayonet attack and then counter charging the british for the first time as part of washingtons army
after the battle of monmouth washington came to realize that saving entire towns was not necessary but preserving his army and keeping the revolutionary spirit alive was more important
washington informed henry laurens then president of the second continental congress that the possession of our towns while we have an army in the field will avail them little
although the continental congress was responsible for the war effort and provided supplies to the troops washington took it upon himself to pressure congress and the state legislatures to provide the essentials of war there was never nearly enough
congress evolved in its committee oversight and established the board of war which included members of the military
because the board of war was also a committee ensnared with its own internal procedures congress also created the post of secretary of war appointing major general benjamin lincoln to the position in february
washington worked closely with lincoln to coordinate civilian and military authorities and took charge of training and supplying the army
during the first summer of the war washington began outfitting schooners and other small seagoing vessels to prey on ships supplying the british in boston
the second continental congress established the continental navy on october and appointed esek hopkins as its first commander for most of the war the continental navy included only a handful of small frigates and sloops supported by numerous privateers
on november congress authorized the creation of the continental marines which ultimately evolved into and was named the united states marine corps
john paul jones became the first american naval hero when he captured hms drake on april the first victory for any american military vessel in british waters
the last such victory was by the frigate uss alliance commanded by captain john barry
on march the alliance outgunned hms sybil in a minute duel while escorting spanish gold from havana to the congress in philadelphia
after yorktown all us navy ships were sold or given away it was the first time in americas history that it had no fighting forces on the high seas
congress primarily commissioned privateers to reduce costs and to take advantage of the large proportion of colonial sailors found in the british empire
in total they included ships that successfully captured enemy ships to damage the british effort and to enrich themselves with the proceeds from the sale of cargo and the ship itself
about sailors served aboard american privateers during the war
at the beginning of the revolutionary war the americans had no major international allies since most nation states watched and waited to see how developments unfolded in the conflict in british america
over time the continental army established its military credibility defeating or holding their own against british regulars and their hired hessians known to all european great powers
battles such as the battle of bennington the battles of saratoga and even defeats such as the battle of germantown proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful european nations including france spain and the dutch republic the dutch impressed by these american victories and conflicts moved from covertly supplying the americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them
the decisive american victory at saratoga convinced france which was already a long time rival of britain to offer the americans the treaty of amity and commerce
the two nations also agreed to a defensive treaty of alliance to protect their trade and also guaranteed american independence from britain
to engage the united states as a french ally militarily the treaty was conditioned on britain initiating a war on france to stop it from trading with the us spain and the dutch republic were invited to join by both france and the united states in the treaty but neither was responsive to the request
on june france declared war on great britain and it invoked the french military alliance with the us which ensured additional us private support for french possessions in the caribbean
washington worked closely with the soldiers and navy that france would send to america primarily through lafayette on his staff
french assistance made critical contributions required to defeat cornwallis at yorktown in
the british military had considerable experience of fighting in north america most recently during the seven years war which forced france to give up new france in
however in previous conflicts they benefited from local logistics as well as support from the colonial militia which was not available in the american revolutionary war
reinforcements had to come from europe and maintaining large armies over such distances was extremely complex ships could take three months to cross the atlantic and orders from london were often outdated by the time they arrived
prior to the conflict the colonies were largely autonomous economic and political entities with no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance
this meant that unlike europe where the fall of a capital city often ended wars that in america continued even after the loss of major settlements such as philadelphia the seat of congress new york and charleston
british power was reliant on the royal navy whose dominance allowed them to resupply their own expeditionary forces while preventing access to enemy ports
however the majority of the american population was agrarian rather than urban supported by the french navy and blockade runners based in the dutch caribbean their economy was able to survive
the geographical size of the colonies and limited manpower meant the british could not simultaneously conduct military operations and occupy territory without local support
debate persists over whether their defeat was inevitable one british statesman described it as like trying to conquer a map
while ferling argues patriot victory was nothing short of a miracle ellis suggests the odds always favored the americans especially after howe squandered the chance of a decisive british success in an opportunity that would never come again
the us military history speculates the additional commitment of fresh troops in would have placed british victory within the realm of possibility
the expulsion of france from north america in led to a drastic reduction in british troop levels in the colonies in there were only regular soldiers among a civilian population of million
the bulk of military resources in the americas were focused on defending sugar islands in the caribbean jamaica alone generated more revenue than all thirteen american colonies combined
with the end of the seven years war the permanent army in britain was also cut back which resulted in administrative difficulties when the war began a decade later
over the course of the war there were four separate british commanders in chief
the first was thomas gage appointed in whose initial focus was establishing british rule in former french areas of canada
rightly or wrongly many in london blamed the revolt on his failure to take firm action earlier and he was relieved after the heavy losses incurred at the battle of bunker hill in charlestown massachusetts
his replacement was sir william howe a member of the whig faction in parliament who opposed the policy of coercion advocated by lord north cornwallis who later surrendered at yorktown was one of many senior officers who initially refused to serve in north america
the campaign showed the british overestimated the capabilities of their own troops and underestimated the colonial militia requiring a reassessment of tactics and strategy
however it allowed the patriots to take the initiative and british authorities rapidly lost control over every colony
howes responsibility is still debated despite receiving large numbers of reinforcements bunker hill seems to have permanently affected his self confidence and lack of tactical flexibility meant he often failed to follow up opportunities
many of his decisions were attributed to supply problems such as the delay in launching the new york campaign and failure to pursue washingtons beaten army
having lost the confidence of his subordinates he was recalled after burgoyne surrendered at saratoga
following the failure of the carlisle commission british policy changed from treating the patriots as subjects who needed to be reconciled to enemies who had to be defeated
in howe was replaced by sir henry clinton appointed instead of carleton who was considered overly cautious
regarded as an expert on tactics and strategy like his predecessors clinton was handicapped by chronic supply issues
as a result he was largely inactive in and much of in october he warned germain of fatal consequences if matters did not improve
in addition clintons strategy was compromised by conflict with political superiors in london and his colleagues in north america especially admiral mariot arbuthnot replaced in early by rodney
he was neither notified nor consulted when germain approved cornwalliss invasion of the south in and delayed sending him reinforcements believing the bulk of washingtons army was still outside new york city
after the surrender at yorktown clinton was relieved by carleton whose major task was to oversee the evacuation of loyalists and british troops from savannah charleston and new york city
during the th century states commonly hired foreign soldiers including britain
during the seven years war foreign soldiers comprised of the british army and their use caused little debate
when it became clear additional troops were needed to suppress the revolt in america it was decided to employ professional german soldiers
there were several reasons for this including public sympathy for the patriot cause an historical reluctance to expand the british army and the time needed to recruit and train new regiments
an alternate source was readily available in the holy roman empire where many smaller states had a long tradition of renting their armies to the highest bidder
the most important was hesse kassel known as the mercenary state
the first supply agreements were signed by the north administration in late over the next decade more than germans fought in north america gibraltar south africa and india of whom served in the american war
often generically referred to as hessians they included men from many other states including hanover and brunswick
sir henry clinton recommended recruiting russian troops whom he rated very highly having seen them in action against the ottomans however negotiations with catherine the great made little progress
unlike previous wars their use led to intense political debate in britain france and even germany where frederick the great refused to provide passage through his territories for troops hired for the american war
in march the agreements were challenged in parliament by whigs who objected to coercion in general and the use of foreign soldiers to subdue british subjects
the debates were covered in detail by american newspapers which reprinted key speeches and in may they received copies of the treaties themselves
provided by british sympathizers these were smuggled into north america from london by george merchant a recently released american prisoner
the prospect of foreign german soldiers being used in the colonies bolstered support for independence more so than taxation and other acts combined the king was accused of declaring war on his own subjects leading to the idea there were now two separate governments
by apparently showing britain was determined to go to war it made hopes of reconciliation seem naive and hopeless while the employment of what was regarded as foreign mercenaries became one of the charges levelled against george iii in the declaration of independence
the hessian reputation within germany for brutality also increased support for the patriot cause among german american immigrants
the presence of over german americans meant both sides felt the german soldiers might be persuaded to desert one reason clinton suggested employing russians was that he felt they were less likely to defect
when the first german troops arrived on staten island in august congress approved the printing of handbills promising land and citizenship to any willing to join the patriot cause
the british launched a counter campaign claiming deserters could well be executed for meddling in a war that was not theirs
desertion among the germans occurred throughout the war with the highest rate of desertion occurring during the time between the surrender at yorktown and the treaty of paris
german regiments were central to the british war effort of the estimated sent to america some became casualties
wealthy loyalists convinced the british government that most of the colonists were sympathetic toward the crown consequently british military planners relied on recruiting loyalists but had trouble recruiting sufficient numbers as the patriots had widespread support
nevertheless they continued to deceive themselves on their level of american support as late as a year before hostilities ended
approximately loyalists fought for the british throughout the war
although loyalists constituted about twenty percent of the colonial population they were concentrated in distinct communities
many of them lived among large plantation owners in the tidewater region and south carolina who produced cash crops in tobacco and indigo comparable to global markets in caribbean sugar
when the british began probing the backcountry in they were faced with a major problem any significant level of organized loyalist activity required a continued presence of british regulars
the available manpower that the british had in america was insufficient to protect loyalist territory and counter american offensives
the loyalist militias in the south were constantly defeated by neighboring patriot militia
the most critical combat between the two partisan militias was at the battle of kings mountain the patriot victory irreversibly impaired any further loyalist militia capability in the south
when the early war policy was administered by howe the crowns need to maintain loyalist support prevented it from using the traditional revolt suppression methods
the british cause suffered when their troops ransacked local homes during an aborted attack on charleston in that enraged both patriots and loyalists
after congress rejected the carlisle peace commission in and westminster turned to hard war during clintons command neutral colonists in the carolinas often allied with the patriots whenever brutal combat broke out between tories and whigs
conversely loyalists gained support when patriots intimidated suspected tories by destroying property or tarring and feathering
a loyalist militia unit the british legion provided some of the best troops in british service it received a commission in the british army
it was a mixed regiment of dragoons and infantry supported by batteries of flying artillery
it was commanded by tarleton and gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies for brutality and needless slaughterin may the british legion was one of five regiments that formed the american establishment
women played various roles during the revolutionary war they often accompanied their husbands when permitted to do so
for example throughout the war martha washington was known to visit and provide aid to her husband george at various american camps and frederika charlotte riedesel documented the saratoga campaign
women often accompanied armies as camp followers to sell goods and perform necessary tasks in hospitals and camps
they were a necessary part of eighteenth century armies and numbered in the thousands during the war
women also assumed military roles aside from military tasks like treating the wounded or setting up camp some dressed as men to directly support combat fight or act as spies on both sides of the revolutionary war
anna maria lane joined her husband in the army and wore mens clothes by the time the battle of germantown happened
the virginia general assembly later cited her bravery she fought while dressed as a man and performed extraordinary military services and received a severe wound at the battle of germantown
with the courage of a soldier
on april sybil ludington is said to have ridden to alert militia forces of putnam county new york and danbury connecticut to warn them of the britishs approach she has been called the female paul revere
a report in the new england quarterly says there is little evidence backing the story and whether the ride occurred is questioned
a few others disguised themselves as men
deborah sampson fought until her gender was discovered and discharged as a result sally st
clair was killed in action during the war
when war began the population of the thirteen colonies included an estimated slaves predominantly used as labor on southern plantations
in november lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued a proclamation that promised freedom to any patriot owned slaves willing to bear arms
although the announcement helped to fill a temporary manpower shortage white loyalist prejudice meant recruits were eventually redirected to non combatant roles
the loyalists motive was to deprive patriot planters of labor rather than to end slavery loyalist owned slaves were returned
the philipsburg proclamation issued by clinton extended the offer of freedom to patriot owned slaves throughout the colonies
it persuaded entire families to escape to british lines many of which were employed on farms to grow food for the army by removing the requirement for military service
while clinton organized the black pioneers he also ensured fugitive slaves were returned to loyalist owners with orders that they were not to be punished for their attempted escape
as the war progressed service as regular soldiers in british units became increasingly common black loyalists formed two regiments of the charleston garrison in
estimates of the numbers who served the british during the war vary from to excluding those who escaped during wartime
thomas jefferson estimated that virginia may have lost slaves in total escapes
in south carolina nearly slaves either fled migrated or died which significantly disrupted the plantation economies both during and after the war
black patriots were barred from the continental army until washington convinced congress in january that there was no other way to replace losses from disease and desertion
the st rhode island regiment formed in february included former slaves whose owners were compensated however only of its soldiers were black and recruitment stopped in june
ultimately around african americans served in the continental army and navy in a variety of roles while another were employed in patriot militia units aboard privateers or as teamsters servants and spies
after the war a small minority received land grants or congressional pensions in old age many others were returned to their masters post war despite earlier promises of freedom
as a patriot victory became increasingly likely the treatment of black loyalists became a point of contention after the surrender of yorktown in washington insisted all escapees be returned but cornwallis refused
in and around to freed blacks were evacuated by the british from charleston savannah and new york some moved onto london while to settled in nova scotia where they founded settlements such as birchtown
white loyalists transported enslaved blacks to jamaica and the bahamas
the free black loyalists who migrated to the british west indies included regular soldiers from dunmores ethiopian regiment and those from charleston who helped garrison the leeward islands
most native americans east of the mississippi river were affected by the war and many tribes were divided over how to respond to the conflict
a few tribes were friendly with the colonists but most natives opposed the union of the colonies as a potential threat to their territory
approximately natives fought on the british side with the largest group coming from the iroquois tribes who deployed around men
early in july cherokee allies of britain attacked the short lived washington district of north carolina
their defeat splintered both cherokee settlements and people and was directly responsible for the rise of the chickamauga cherokee who perpetuated the cherokee american wars against american settlers for decades after hostilities with britain ended
muscogee and seminole allies of britain fought against americans in georgia and south carolina
in a force of muscogee destroyed american settlements along the broad river in georgia
muscogee warriors also joined thomas browns raids into south carolina and assisted britain during the siege of savannah
many native americans were involved in the fight between britain and spain on the gulf coast and along the british side of the mississippi river
thousands of muscogee chickasaw and choctaw fought in major battles such as the battle of fort charlotte the battle of mobile and the siege of pensacola
the iroquois confederacy was shattered as a result of the american revolutionary war whatever side they took the seneca onondaga and cayuga tribes sided with the british members of the mohawks fought on both sides and many tuscarora and oneida sided with the americans
to retaliate against raids on american settlement by loyalists and their indian allies the continental army dispatched the sullivan expedition on a punitive expedition throughout new york to debilitate the iroquois tribes that had sided with the british
mohawk leaders joseph louis cook and joseph brant sided with the americans and the british respectively which further exacerbated the split
in the western theater of the american revolutionary war conflicts between settlers and native americans led to lingering distrust
in the treaty of paris great britain ceded control of the disputed lands between the great lakes and the ohio river but the indian inhabitants were not a part of the peace negotiations
tribes in the northwest territory joined as the western confederacy and allied with the british to resist american settlement and their conflict continued after the revolutionary war as the northwest indian war
lord north prime minister since delegated control of the war in north america to lord george germain and the earl of sandwich who was head of the royal navy from to
defeat at saratoga in made it clear the revolt would not be easily suppressed especially after the franco american alliance of february and french declaration of war in june
with spain also expected to join the conflict the royal navy needed to prioritize either the war in america or in europe germain advocated the former sandwich the latter
british negotiators now proposed a second peace settlement to congress
the terms presented by the carlisle peace commission included acceptance of the principle of self government
parliament would recognize congress as the governing body suspend any objectionable legislation surrender its right to local colonial taxation and discuss including american representatives in the house of commons
in return all property confiscated from loyalists would be returned british debts honored and locally enforced martial law accepted
however congress demanded either immediate recognition of independence or the withdrawal of all british troops they knew the commission were not authorized to accept these bringing negotiations to a rapid end
when the commissioners returned to london in november they recommended a change in policy
sir henry clinton the new british commander in chief in america was ordered to stop treating the rebels as enemies rather than subjects whose loyalty might be regained
those standing orders would be in effect for three years until clinton was relieved
north initially backed the southern strategy attempting to exploit divisions between the mercantile north and slave owning south but after the defeat of yorktown he was forced to accept the fact that this policy had failed
it was clear the war was lost although the royal navy forced the french to relocate their fleet to the caribbean in november and resumed a close blockade of american trade
the resulting economic damage and rising inflation meant the us was now eager to end the war while france was unable to provide further loans congress could no longer pay its soldiers
on february a whig motion to end the offensive war in america was carried by votes
north now resigned obliging the king to invite lord rockingham to form a government a consistent supporter of the patriot cause he made a commitment to us independence a condition of doing so
george iii reluctantly accepted and the new government took office on march however rockingham died unexpectedly on july and was replaced by lord shelburne who acknowledged american independence
when lord rockingham the whig leader and friend of the american cause was elevated to prime minister congress consolidated its diplomatic consuls in europe into a peace delegation at paris
all were experienced in congressional leadership
the dean of the delegation was franklin of pennsylvania
he had become a celebrity in the french court but he was also an enlightenment scientist with influence in the courts of european great powers in prussia englands former ally and austria a catholic empire like spain
since the s franklin had been an organizer of british american inter colony cooperation and then served as a colonial lobbyist to parliament in london
john adams of massachusetts had been consul to the dutch republic and was a prominent early new england patriot
john jay of new york had been consul to spain and was a past president of the continental congress
as consul to the dutch republic henry laurens of south carolina had secured a preliminary agreement for a trade agreement
he had been a successor to john jay as president of congress and with franklin was a member of the american philosophical society
although active in the preliminaries he was not a signer of the conclusive treaty
the whig negotiators for lord rockingham and his successor prime minister lord shelburne included long time friend of benjamin franklin from his time in london david hartley and richard oswald who had negotiated laurens release from the tower of london
the preliminary peace signed on november met four key congressional demands independence territory up to the mississippi navigation rights into the gulf of mexico and fishing rights in newfoundland
british strategy was to strengthen the us sufficiently to prevent france from regaining a foothold in north america and they had little interest in these proposals
however divisions between their opponents allowed them to negotiate separately with each to improve their overall position starting with the american delegation in september
the french and spanish sought to improve their position by creating the us dependent on them for support against britain thus reversing the losses of
both parties tried to negotiate a settlement with britain excluding the americans france proposed setting the western boundary of the us along the appalachians matching the british proclamation line
the spanish suggested additional concessions in the vital mississippi river basin but required the cession of georgia in violation of the franco american alliance
facing difficulties with spain over claims involving the mississippi river and from france who was still reluctant to agree to american independence until all her demands were met john jay promptly told the british that he was willing to negotiate directly with them cutting off france and spain and prime minister lord shelburne in charge of the british negotiations agreed
key agreements for the united states in obtaining peace included recognition of united states independence including recognition that the us would gain all of the area east of the mississippi river north of florida and south of canada and the granting of fishing rights in the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland and in the gulf of saint lawrence the united states and great britain were each given perpetual access to the mississippi river
an anglo american preliminary peace was formally entered into in november and congress endorsed the settlement on april
it announced the achievement of peace with independence and the conclusive treaty was signed on september in paris effective the following day on september when britain signed its treaty with france
john adams who helped draft the treaty claimed it represented one of the most important political events that ever happened on the globe
ratified respectively by congress and parliament the final versions were exchanged in paris the following spring
on november the last british troops remaining in the us were evacuated from new york to halifax
washington expressed astonishment that the americans had won a war against a leading world power referring to the american victory as little short of a standing miracle
the conflict between british subjects with the crown against those with the congress had lasted over eight years from to
the last uniformed british troops departed their last east coast port cities in savannah charleston and new york city by november which marked the end of british occupation in the new united states
on april washington issued orders that he had long waited to give that all acts of hostility were to cease immediately
that same day by arrangement with washington carleton issued a similar order to british troops
british troops however were not to evacuate until a prisoner of war exchange occurred an effort that involved much negotiation and would take some seven months to effect
as directed by a congressional resolution of may all non commissioned officers and enlisted were furloughed to their homes until the definitive treaty of peace when they would be automatically discharged
the us armies were directly disbanded in the field as of washingtons general orders on monday june
once the treaty of paris was signed with britain on september washington resigned as commander in chief of the continental army and left to retire at mount vernon
the expanse of territory that was now the us was ceded from its colonial mother country alone
it included millions of sparsely settled acres south of the great lakes line between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river much of which was part of canada
the tentative colonial migration west became a flood during the years of the revolutionary war
kentucky county virginia for instance had a population of
by years later its population had grown to over
britains extended post war policy for the us continued to try to establish an indian barrier state below the great lakes as late as during the war of
the formally acquired western american lands continued to be populated by a dozen or so american indian tribes that had been british allies for the most part
though british forts on their lands had been ceded to either the french or the british prior to the creation of the us natives were not referred to in the british cession to the us while tribes were not consulted by the british for the treaty in practice the british refused to abandon the forts on territory they formally transferred
instead they provisioned military allies for continuing frontier raids and sponsored the northwest indian war including erecting an additional british fort miami in maumee ohio
british sponsorship of local warfare on the us continued until the anglo american jay treaty authored by hamilton went into effect on february
at the same time the spanish also sponsored war within the us by indian proxies in its southwest territory ceded by france to britain then britain to the americans
of the european powers with american colonies adjacent to the newly created us spain was most threatened by american independence and it was correspondingly the most hostile to it
its territory adjacent to the us was relatively undefended so spanish policy developed a combination of initiatives
spanish soft power diplomatically challenged the british territorial cession west to the mississippi river and the previous northern boundaries of spanish florida
it imposed a high tariff on american goods then blocked american settler access to the port of new orleans
spanish hard power extended war alliances and arms to southwestern natives to resist american settlement
a former continental army general james wilkinson settled in kentucky county virginia in and there he fostered settler secession from virginia during the conflict with the spanish allied chickamauga cherokee
beginning in he received pay as spanish agent and subsequently expanded his efforts to persuade american settlers west of the appalachian mountains to secede from the united states first in the washington administration and later again in the jefferson administration
the total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown
as was typical in wars of the era diseases such as smallpox claimed more lives than battle
between and a smallpox epidemic broke out throughout north america killing an estimated among all its populations during those years
historian joseph ellis suggests that washingtons decision to have his troops inoculated against the disease was one of his most important decisions
up to american patriots died during active military service
of these approximately were killed in battle while at least died from disease
the majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the british mostly in the prison ships in new york harbor
the number of patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from to
the french suffered killed in combat in the united states
the spanish lost a total of killed and wounded in west florida
a british report in puts their total army deaths at in north america
approximately germans died in british service in addition to deserters among those labeled german deserters however it is estimated that were killed in combat
the american revolution established the united states with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments
the united states has the worlds oldest written constitution and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the us constitution often word for word in places
it inspired revolutions in france haiti latin america and elsewhere in the modern era
although the revolution eliminated many forms of inequality it did little to change the status of women despite the role they played in winning independence
most significantly it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war
while many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some yet denying it to others the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition too great a challenge
between and many of the states banned the importation of slaves but the institution itself continued
in virginia passed a law permitting manumission and over the next eight years more than slaves were given their freedom
with support from benjamin franklin in the quakers petitioned congress to abolish slavery the number of abolitionist movements greatly increased and by all the northern states had outlawed it
however even many like adams who viewed slavery as a foul contagion opposed the petition as a threat to the union
in jefferson passed legislation banning the importation of slaves but allowed the domestic slave trade to continue arguing the federal government had no right to regulate individual states
prior to the american revolution slavery was legal and it was normal around the world
and it had been that way for thousands of years
the american revolution changed that
american freedom is what made slavery into an issue
as historian christopher l
brown put it slavery had never been on the agenda in a serious way before but the revolution forced it to be a public question from there forward
the body of historical writings on the american revolution cite many motivations for the patriot revolt that ultimately led to the nations independence and establishment
american patriots stressed the denial of their constitutional rights as englishmen especially no taxation without representation
contemporaries credit the american enlightenment with laying the intellectual moral and ethical foundations for the american revolution among the founding fathers who were influenced by the classical liberalism of john locke and other enlightenment age writers and philosophers
two treatises of government has long been cited as a major influence on revolutionary era american thinking but historians david lundberg and henry f
may contend that lockes essay concerning human understanding was far more widely read than were his political treatises
historians since the s have emphasized that the patriot constitutional argument was made possible by the emergence of a sense of american nationalism that united the thirteen colonies
in turn that nationalism was rooted in a republican value system that demanded consent of the governed and deeply opposed aristocratic control
in britain on the other hand republicanism was largely a fringe ideology since it challenged the aristocratic control of the british monarchy and political system
political power was not controlled by an aristocracy or nobility in the colonies instead the colonial political system was based on the winners of free elections which were open at the time to the majority of white men
in analysis of the revolution historians in recent decades have often cited three motivations behind it after the first us postage stamp was issued in the us postal service frequently issued commemorative stamps celebrating the various people and events of the revolutionary war
the first such stamp was the liberty bell issue of on the th anniversary of american independence

the ampere often shortened to amp is the unit of electric current in the international system of units
one ampere is equal to coulomb moving past a point per second
it is named after french mathematician and physicist andr marie ampre considered the father of electromagnetism along with danish physicist hans christian rsted
as of the redefinition of the si base units the ampere is defined by fixing the elementary charge to be exactly which means an ampere is an electric current equivalent to elementary charges moving every seconds or elementary charges moving in a second
prior to the redefinition the ampere was defined as the current passing through two parallel wires metre apart that produces a magnetic force of newtons per metre
the earlier cgs system has two units of current one structured similarly to the sis and the other using coulombs law as a fundamental relationship with the cgs unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates
the cgs unit of current is then defined as one unit of charge per second
the ampere is named for french physicist and mathematician andr marie ampre who studied electromagnetism and laid the foundation of electrodynamics
in recognition of ampres contributions to the creation of modern electrical science an international convention signed at the international exposition of electricity established the ampere as a standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current
the ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of electric current in the centimetre gram second system of units
that unit now known as the abampere was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart
the size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the mksa system would be conveniently sized
the international ampere was an early realization of the ampere defined as the current that would deposit of silver per second from a silver nitrate solution
later more accurate measurements revealed that this current is
since power is defined as the product of current and voltage the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship and thus a w v
current can be measured by a multimeter a device that can measure electrical voltage current and resistance
the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to newtons per metre of length
ampres force law states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current
this force is used in the formal definition of the ampere
the si unit of charge the coulomb was then defined as the quantity of electricity carried in second by a current of ampere
conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge was determined by steady current flowing for a time as
this definition of the ampere was most accurately realised using a kibble balance but in practice the unit was maintained via ohms law from the units of electromotive force and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two could be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect respectively
techniques to establish the realisation of an ampere had a relative uncertainty of approximately a few parts in and involved realisations of the watt the ohm and the volt
the redefinition of the si base units defined the ampere by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge to be when expressed in the unit c which is equal to as where the second is defined in terms of the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom
the si unit of charge the coulomb is the quantity of electricity carried in second by a current of ampere
conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge is determined by steady current flowing for a time as
constant instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes and the charge accumulated over a period of time is expressed in coulombs
the relation of the ampere to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt to the joule
the international system of units is based on seven si base units the second metre kilogram kelvin ampere mole and candela representing seven fundamental types of physical quantity or dimensions with all other si units being defined using these
these si derived units can either be given special names eg watt volt lux etc
or defined in terms of others eg metre per second
the units with special names derived from the ampere are there are also some si units that are frequently used in the context of electrical engineering and electrical appliances but are defined independently of the ampere notably the hertz joule watt candela lumen and lux
like other si units the ampere can be modified by adding a prefix that multiplies it by a power of
in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is a sequence of mathematically rigorous instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation
algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing
more advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes and deduce valid inferences achieving automation eventually
using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by alan turing with terms such as memory search and stimulus
in contrast a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results especially in problem domains where there is no well defined correct or optimal result
for example social media recommender systems rely on heuristics in such a way that although widely characterized as algorithms in st century popular media cannot deliver correct results due to the nature of the problem
as an effective method an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well defined formal language for calculating a function
starting from an initial state and initial input the instructions describe a computation that when executed proceeds through a finite number of well defined successive states eventually producing output and terminating at a final ending state
the transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized algorithms incorporate random input
around ad persian scientist and polymath muammad ibn ms al khwrizm wrote kitb al isb al hind and kitab al jam wal tafriq al isb al hind
in the early th century latin translations of said al khwarizmi texts involving the hindu arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared for example liber alghoarismi de practica arismetrice attributed to john of seville and liber algorismi de numero indorum attributed to adelard of bath
hereby alghoarismi or algorismi is the latinization of al khwarizmis name the text starts with the phrase dixit algorismi or thus spoke al khwarizmi
around the english word algorism is attested and then by chaucer in english adopted the french term
in the th century under the influence of the greek word the latin word was altered to algorithmus
one informal definition is a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations which would include all computer programs and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook book recipe
in general a program is an algorithm only if it stops eventually even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable
define an algorithm to be a set of instructions for determining an output given explicitly in a form that can be followed by either a computing machine or a human who could only carry out specific elementary operations on symbols
the concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidability a notion that is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules
in logic the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured as it is not apparently related to the customary physical dimension
from such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete and abstract usage of the term
most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs
however algorithms are also implemented by other means such as in a biological neural network in an electrical circuit or in a mechanical device
since antiquity step by step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been attested
this includes in babylonian mathematics egyptian mathematics indian mathematics the ifa oracle greek mathematics and arabic mathematics
the earliest evidence of algorithms is found in the babylonian mathematics of ancient mesopotamia
a sumerian clay tablet found in shuruppak near baghdad and dated to described the earliest division algorithm
during the hammurabi dynasty babylonian clay tablets described algorithms for computing formulas
algorithms were also used in babylonian astronomy
babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events
algorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient egyptian mathematics dating back to the rhind mathematical papyrus
algorithms were later used in ancient hellenistic mathematics
two examples are the sieve of eratosthenes which was described in the introduction to arithmetic by nicomachus and the euclidean algorithm which was first described in euclids elements examples of ancient indian mathematics included the shulba sutras the kerala school and the brhmasphuasiddhnta
the first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by al kindi a th century arab mathematician in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages
he gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis the earliest codebreaking algorithm
bolter credits the invention of the weight driven clock as the key invention europe in the middle ages
in particular he credits the verge escapement mechanism that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock
the accurate automatic machine led immediately to mechanical automata beginning in the th century and finally to computational machines the difference engine and analytical engines of charles babbage and countess ada lovelace mid th century
lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer babbages analytical engine the first device considered a real turing complete computer instead of just a calculator and is sometimes called historys first programmer as a result though a full implementation of babbages second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime
bell and newell indicate that the jacquard loom a precursor to hollerith cards and telephone switching technologies were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers
by the mid th century the telegraph the precursor of the telephone was in use throughout the world its discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as dots and dashes a common sound
by the late th century the ticker tape was in use as was the use of hollerith cards in the us census
then came the teleprinter with its punched paper use of baudot code on tape
telephone switching networks of electromechanical relays was behind the work of george stibitz the inventor of the digital adding device
as he worked in bell laboratories he observed the burdensome use of mechanical calculators with gears
he went home one evening in intending to test his idea
when the tinkering was over stibitz had constructed a binary adding device
the mathematician martin davis supported the particular importance of the electromechanical relay
in a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithms began with attempts to solve the entscheidungsproblem posed by david hilbert
later formalizations were framed as attempts to define effective calculability or effective method
those formalizations included the gdel herbrand kleene recursive functions of and alonzo churchs lambda calculus of emil posts formulation of and alan turings turing machines of and
algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation including natural languages pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts programming languages or control tables
natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms
pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in statements based on natural language
programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but they are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms
there is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables as flowcharts and drakon charts or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called sets of quadruples
representations of algorithms can also be classified into three accepted levels of turing machine description high level description implementation description and formal description
a high level description describes qualities of the algorithm itself ignoring how it is implemented on the turing machine
an implementation description describes the general manner in which the machine moves its head and stores data in order to carry out the algorithm but doesnt give exact states
in the most detail a formal description gives the exact state table and list of transitions of the turing machine
the graphical aid called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm
like the program flow of a minsky machine a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down
its primary symbols are only four the directed arrow showing program flow the rectangle the diamond and the dot
the bhm jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes
sub structures can nest in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure
the symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram
it is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource is theoretically required for a given algorithm
methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers for example an algorithm that adds up the elements of a list of n numbers would have a time requirement of using big o notation
at all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the sum of all the elements so far and its current position in the input list
therefore it is said to have a space requirement of if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted or if it is counted
different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time space or effort than others
for example a binary search algorithm outperforms a sequential search when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays
the analysis and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation
in this sense algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation
usually pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation
however ultimately most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code
for the solution of a one off problem the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences but for algorithms designed for fast interactive commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical
scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign
empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance
benchmarks may be used to compare before after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization
empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis though and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner
to illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well established algorithms a recent significant innovation relating to fft algorithms can decrease processing time up to times for applications like medical imaging
in general speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem which are very common in practical applications
speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing to consume less power
algorithm design refers to a method or a mathematical process for problem solving and engineering algorithms
the design of algorithms is part of many solution theories such as divide and conquer or dynamic programming within operation research
techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern
one of the most important aspects of algorithm design is resource efficiency the big o notation is used to describe eg an algorithms run time growth as the size of its input increases
per the church turing thesis any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be turing complete
in fact it has been demonstrated that turing completeness requires only four instruction types conditional goto unconditional goto assignment halt
however kemeny and kurtz observe that while undisciplined use of unconditional gotos and conditional if then gotos can result in spaghetti code a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions on the other hand it is also possible and not too hard to write badly structured programs in a structured language
tausworthe augments the three bhm jacopini canonical structures sequence if then else and while do with two more do while and case
an additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction
there are various ways to classify algorithms each with its own merits
one way to classify algorithms is by implementation means
another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm
there is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other
furthermore each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms
some common paradigms are algorithms by themselves are not usually patentable
in the united states a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts numbers or signals does not constitute processes so algorithms are not patentable
however practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable
for example in diamond v
diehr the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable
the patenting of software is controversial and there are criticized patents involving algorithms especially data compression algorithms such as unisyss lzw patent
additionally some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions
one of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order
finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list
from this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in a high level description in english prose as high level description formal description an annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle from germination to the production of seeds within one growing season and then dies
globally only of all plant species and of herbaceous plants are annuals
the annual life cycle has independently emerged in over different plant families throughout the entire angiosperm phylogeny
traditionally there has been a prevailing assumption that annuals have evolved from perennial ancestors
however recent research challenges this notion revealing instances where perennials have evolved from annual ancestors
intriguingly models propose that transition rates from an annual to a perennial life cycle are twice as fast as the reverse transition
the life history theory posits that annual plants are favored when adult mortality is higher than seedling mortality ie annuals will dominate environments with disturbances or high temporal variability reducing adult survival
this hypothesis finds support in observations of increased prevalence of annuals in regions with hot dry summers with elevated adult mortality and high seed persistence
furthermore the evolution of the annual life cycle under hot dry summer in different families makes it one of the best examples of convergent evolution
additionally annual prevalence is also positively affected by year to year variability
globally the prevalence of annual plants shows an upward trend with an increasing human footprint
moreover domestic grazing has been identified as contributing to the heightened abundance of annuals in grasslands
disturbances linked to activities like grazing and agriculture particularly following european settlement have facilitated the invasion of annual species from europe and asia into the new world
in various ecosystems the dominance of annual plants is often a temporary phase during secondary succession particularly in the aftermath of disturbances
for instance after fields are abandoned annuals may initially colonize them but are eventually replaced by long lived species
however in certain mediterranean systems a unique scenario unfolds when annuals establish dominance perennials do not necessarily supplant them
this peculiarity is attributed to alternative stable states in the system both annual dominance and perennial states prove stable with the ultimate system state dependent on the initial conditions
annual plants commonly exhibit a higher growth rate allocate more resources to seeds and allocate fewer resources to roots than perennials
in contrast to perennials which feature long lived plants and short lived seeds annual plants compensate for their lower longevity by maintaining a higher persistence of soil seed banks
these differences in life history strategies profoundly affect ecosystem functioning and services
for instance annuals by allocating less resources belowground play a minor role in reducing erosion storing organic carbon and achieving lower nutrient and water use efficiencies than perennials
the distinctions between annual and perennial plants are notably evident in agricultural contexts
despite constituting a minor part of global biomass annual species stand out as the primary food source for humankind likely owing to their greater allocation of resources to seed production thereby enhancing agricultural productivity
in the anthropocene epoch marked by human impact on the environment there has been a substantial increase in the global cover of annuals
this shift is primarily attributed to the conversion of natural systems often dominated by perennials into annual cropland
currently annual plants cover approximately of croplands and contribute to around of worldwide food consumption
in it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to its conversion into a perennial plant
researchers deactivated the soc and ful genes of arabidopsis thaliana
this switch established phenotypes common in perennial plants such as wood formation
the anthophytes are a paraphyletic grouping of plant taxa bearing flower like reproductive structures
the group once thought to be a clade contained the angiosperms the extant flowering plants such as roses and grasses as well as the gnetales and the extinct bennettitales
detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel
this makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around mya
some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a hypothetical group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of extinct seed plant groups but not the gnetales
an atlas is a collection of maps
mouthwash mouth rinse oral rinse or mouth bath is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swirled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and or movement of the head and may be gargled where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth
usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the mouth although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic anti inflammatory or anti fungal action
additionally some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia
cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste
rinsing with water or mouthwash after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste can reduce the availability of salivary fluoride
this can lower the anti cavity re mineralization and antibacterial effects of fluoride
fluoridated mouthwash may mitigate this effect or in high concentrations increase available fluoride but is not as cost effective as leaving the fluoride toothpaste on the teeth after brushing
a group of experts discussing post brushing rinsing in found that although there was clear guidance given in many public health advice publications to spit avoid rinsing with water excessive rinsing with water they believed there was a limited evidence base for best practice
common use involves rinsing the mouth with about ml of mouthwash
the wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spat out
most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash
in some brands the expectorate is stained so that one can see the bacteria and debris
mouthwash should not be used immediately after brushing the teeth so as not to wash away the beneficial fluoride residue left from the toothpaste
similarly the mouth should not be rinsed out with water after brushing
patients were told to spit dont rinse after toothbrushing as part of a national health service campaign in the uk
a fluoride mouthrinse can be used at a different time of the day to brushing
gargling is where the head is tilted back allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling causing the liquid to bubble
gargling is practiced in japan for perceived prevention of viral infection
one commonly used way is with infusions or tea
in some cultures gargling is usually done in private typically in a bathroom at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away
if one drinks mouthwash serious harm and even death can quickly result from the high alcohol content and other substances harmful to ingestion present in mouthwash
it is a common cause of death among homeless people during winter months because a person can feel warmer after drinking it
the most commonly used mouthwashes are commercial antiseptics which are used at home as part of an oral hygiene routine
mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions
variations are common and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about patient safety
some manufacturers of mouthwash state that their antiseptic and antiplaque mouthwashes kill the bacterial plaque that causes cavities gingivitis and bad breath
it is however generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing
the american dental association asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases in addition to regular dental check ups although they approve many mouthwashes
for many patients however the mechanical methods could be tedious and time consuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult
chemotherapeutic agents including mouthwashes could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care preventing and controlling supragingival plaque gingivitis and oral malodor
minor and transient side effects of mouthwashes are very common such as taste disturbance tooth staining sensation of a dry mouth etc
alcohol containing mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse as they dry out the mouth
soreness ulceration and redness may sometimes occur if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives coloring flavors and fragrances
such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water using a different mouthwash or foregoing mouthwash entirely
prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as tooth extraction or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy
they are also prescribed for aphthous ulcers other oral ulcers and other mouth pain
magic mouthwashes are prescription mouthwashes compounded in a pharmacy from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor
despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions many patients and prescribers continue to use them
there has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash it shows no difference in efficacy between the most common magic mouthwash formulation on the one hand and commercial mouthwashes or a saline baking soda solution on the other
current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief and in shortening the healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies
the first known references to mouth rinsing is in ayurveda for treatment of gingivitis
later in the greek and roman periods mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes and hippocrates recommended a mixture of salt alum and vinegar
the jewish talmud dating back about years suggests a cure for gum ailments containing dough water and olive oil
the ancient chinese had also gargled salt water tea and wine as a form of mouthwash after meals due to the antiseptic properties of those liquids
before europeans came to the americas native north american and mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes often made from plants such as coptis trifolia
peoples of the americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats and other mouthwashes for problems such as teething and mouth ulcers
anton van leeuwenhoek the famous th century microscopist discovered living organisms in deposits on the teeth
he also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in delft
he experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water
next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque
he concluded correctly that the mouthwash either did not reach or was not present long enough to kill the plaque organisms
in german richard seifert invented mouthwash product odol which was produced by company founder karl august lingner in dresden
that remained the state of affairs until the late s when harald loe demonstrated that a chlorhexidine compound could prevent the build up of dental plaque
the reason for chlorhexidines effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours
since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis in addition to fighting bad breath
many of these solutions aim to control the volatile sulfur compound creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste
for example the number of mouthwash variants in the united states of america has grown from to to
research in the field of microbiotas shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless
focused attention on cavity causing bacteria such as streptococcus mutans has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing
while current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing future treatments could provide a viable long term solution
a clinical trial and laboratory studies have shown that alcohol containing mouthwash could reduce the growth of neisseria gonorrhoeae in the pharynx
however subsequent trials have found that there was no difference in gonorrhoea cases among men using daily mouthwash compared to those who did not use mouthwash for weeks
alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque
sometimes a significant amount of alcohol is added as a carrier for the flavor to provide bite
because of the alcohol content it is possible to fail a breathalyzer test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after minutes
in addition alcohol is a drying agent which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds
therefore alcohol containing mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals
it is hypothesized that alcohol in mouthwashes acts as a carcinogen
generally there is no scientific consensus about this
one review stated the same researchers also state that the risk of acquiring oral cancer rises almost five times for users of alcohol containing mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink
in addition the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included dental erosion and accidental poisoning of children
the review garnered media attention and conflicting opinions from other researchers
yinka ebo of cancer research uk disputed the findings concluding that there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer
studies conducted in and did not support an association between alcohol containing mouth rinses and oral cancer
andrew penman chief executive of the cancer council new south wales called for further research on the matter
in a march brief the american dental association said the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcohol containing mouthrinse
many newer brands of mouthwash are alcohol free not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption
in painful oral conditions such as aphthous stomatitis analgesic mouthrinses are sometimes used to ease pain commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating
benzoic acid acts as a buffer
betamethasone is sometimes used as an anti inflammatory corticosteroid mouthwash
it may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis
cetylpyridinium chloride containing mouthwash is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis
cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash has less anti plaque effect than chlorhexidine and may cause staining of teeth or sometimes an oral burning sensation or ulceration
chlorhexidine digluconate is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a solution as a mouthwash
there is no evidence to support that higher concentrations are more effective in controlling dental plaque and gingivitis
a randomized clinical trial conducted in rabat university in morocco found better results in plaque inhibition when chlorohexidine with alcohol base was used when compared to an alcohol free chlorhexidine mouthrinse
chlorhexidine has good substantivity
it has anti plaque action and also some anti fungal action
it is especially effective against gram negative rods
the proportion of gram negative rods increase as gingivitis develops so it is also used to reduce gingivitis
it is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well
chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing
instead chlorhexidine mouthwash is more effective when used as an adjunctive treatment with toothbrushing and flossing
in the short term if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain as may occur in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis chlorhexidine mouthwash is used as a temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures
it is not suited for use in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis however
rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before and after a tooth extraction may reduce the risk of a dry socket
other uses of chlorhexidine mouthwash include prevention of oral candidiasis in immunocompromised persons treatment of denture related stomatitis mucosal ulceration erosions and oral mucosal lesions general burning sensation and many other uses
chlorhexidine mouthwash is known to have minor adverse effects
chlorhexidine binds to tannins meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining of teeth
a systematic review of commercial chlorhexidine products with anti discoloration systems found that the adss were able to reduce tooth staining without affecting the beneficial effects of chlorhexidine
chlorhexidine mouthwash can also cause taste disturbance or alteration
chlorhexidine is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with leukemia desquamation irritation and stomatitis of oral mucosa salivary gland pain and swelling and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
hexetidine also has anti plaque analgesic astringent and anti malodor properties but is considered an inferior alternative to chlorhexidine
in dilute concentrations chlorine dioxide is an ingredient that acts as an antiseptic agent in some mouthwashes
in traditional ayurvedic medicine the use of oil mouthwashes is called kavala or gandusha and this practice has more recently been re marketed by the complementary and alternative medicine industry as oil pulling
its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins which are known as ama in ayurvedic medicine and thereby reducing inflammation
ayurvedic literature claims that oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health including a benefit in conditions such as headaches migraines diabetes mellitus asthma and acne as well as whitening teeth
oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the techniques advocates
when compared with chlorhexidine in one small study it was found to be less effective at reducing oral bacterial load and the other health claims of oil pulling have failed scientific verification or have not been investigated
there is a report of lipid pneumonia caused by accidental inhalation of the oil during oil pulling
the mouth is rinsed with approximately one tablespoon of oil for minutes then spat out
sesame oil coconut oil and ghee are traditionally used but newer oils such as sunflower oil are also used
phenolic compounds and monoterpenes include essential oil constituents that have some antibacterial properties such as eucalyptol eugenol hinokitiol menthol phenol or thymol
essential oils are oils which have been extracted from plants
mouthwashes based on essential oils could be more effective than traditional mouthcare as anti gingival treatments
they have been found effective in reducing halitosis and are being used in several commercial mouthwashes
anti cavity mouthwashes use sodium fluoride to protect against tooth decay
fluoride containing mouthwashes are used as prevention for dental caries for individuals who are considered at higher risk for tooth decay whether due to xerostomia related to salivary dysfunction or side effects of medication to not drinking fluoridated water or to being physically unable to care for their oral needs and as treatment for those with dentinal hypersensitivity gingival recession root exposure
flavoring agents include sweeteners such as sorbitol sucralose sodium saccharin and xylitol which stimulate salivary function due to their sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity
xylitol rinses double as a bacterial inhibitor and have been used as substitute for alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with alcohol
hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash
it kills anaerobic bacteria and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth
it is often used in the short term to treat acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
side effects can occur with prolonged use including hypertrophy of the lingual papillae
enzymes and non enzymatic proteins such as lactoperoxidase lysozyme and lactoferrin have been used in mouthwashes to reduce levels of oral bacteria and hence of the acids produced by these bacteria
oral lidocaine is useful for the treatment of mucositis symptoms induced by radiation or chemotherapy
there is evidence that lidocaine anesthetic mouthwash has the potential to be systemically absorbed when it was tested in patients with oral mucositis who underwent a bone marrow transplant
methyl salicylate functions as an antiseptic antiinflammatory and analgesic agent a flavoring and a fragrance
methyl salicylate has some anti plaque action but less than chlorhexidine
methyl salicylate does not stain teeth
nystatin suspension is an antifungal ingredient used for the treatment of oral candidiasis
a randomized clinical trial found promising results in controlling and reducing dentine hypersensitivity when potassium oxalate mouthwash was used in conjugation with toothbrushing
a study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a povidone iodine solution was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted
other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect
pvp i in general covers a wider virucidal spectrum covering both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses than the other commercially available antiseptics which also includes the novel sars cov virus
sanguinarine containing mouthwashes are marketed as anti plaque and anti malodor treatments
sanguinarine is a toxic alkaloid herbal extract obtained from plants such as sanguinaria canadensis argemone mexicana and others
however its use is strongly associated with the development of leukoplakia usually in the buccal sulcus
this type of leukoplakia has been termed sanguinaria associated keratosis and more than of people with leukoplakia in the vestibule of the mouth have used this substance
upon stopping contact with the causative substance the lesions may persist for years
although this type of leukoplakia may show dysplasia the potential for malignant transformation is unknown
ironically elements within the complementary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer
sodium bicarbonate is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash indicated for any of the reasons that a saltwater mouthwash might be used
pre mixed mouthwashes of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride in aqueous solution are marketed although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required
sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth
saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria which undergo lysis
the heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow to the surgical site promoting healing
hot saltwater mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses
in contrast if heat is applied on the side of the face rather than inside the mouth it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra orally which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face
saltwater mouthwashes are also routinely used after oral surgery to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection
some oral surgeons consider saltwater mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery
in dental extractions hot saltwater mouthbaths should start about hours after a dental extraction
the term mouth bath implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around
once the blood clot has stabilized the mouthwash can be used more vigorously
these mouthwashes tend to be advised for use about times per day especially after meals
sodium lauryl sulfate is used as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes
some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains sls since the anionic compounds in the sls toothpaste can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthwash
sucralfate is a mucosal coating agent composed of an aluminum salt of sulfated sucrose
it is not recommended for use in the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiation due to a lack of efficacy found in a well designed randomized controlled trial
tetracycline is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults
it is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria
similarly minocycline mouthwashes of concentrations can relieve symptoms of recurrent aphthous stomatitis
erythromycin is similar
a tranexamic acid solution is sometimes used as an antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with coagulopathies or who are taking anticoagulants
triclosan is a non ionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes
when used in mouthwash there is moderate substantivity broad spectrum anti bacterial action some anti fungal action and significant anti plaque effect especially when combined with a copolymer or zinc citrate
triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth
the safety of triclosan has been questioned
astringents like zinc chloride provide a pleasant tasting sensation and shrink tissues
zinc when used in combination with other antiseptic agents can limit the buildup of tartar
alexander iii of macedon most commonly known as alexander the great was a king of the ancient greek kingdom of macedon
he succeeded his father philip ii to the throne in bc at the age of and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout western asia central asia parts of south asia and egypt
by the age of he had created one of the largest empires in history stretching from greece to northwestern india
he was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of historys greatest and most successful military commanders
until the age of alexander was tutored by aristotle
in bc shortly after his assumption of kingship over macedon he campaigned in the balkans and reasserted control over thrace and parts of illyria before marching on the city of thebes which was subsequently destroyed in battle
alexander then led the league of corinth and used his authority to launch the pan hellenic project envisaged by his father assuming leadership over all greeks in their conquest of persia
in bc he invaded the achaemenid persian empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for years
following his conquest of asia minor alexander broke the power of achaemenid persia in a series of decisive battles including those at issus and gaugamela he subsequently overthrew darius iii and conquered the achaemenid empire in its entirety
after the fall of persia the macedonian empire held a vast swath of territory between the adriatic sea and the indus river
alexander endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the great outer sea and invaded india in bc achieving an important victory over porus an ancient indian king of present day punjab at the battle of the hydaspes
due to the demand of his homesick troops he eventually turned back at the beas river and later died in bc in babylon the city of mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empires capital
alexanders death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a greek invasion of arabia
in the years following his death a series of civil wars broke out across the macedonian empire eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the diadochi
with his death marking the start of the hellenistic period alexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered such as greco buddhism and hellenistic judaism
he founded more than twenty cities with the most prominent being the city of alexandria in egypt
alexanders settlement of greek colonists and the resulting spread of greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the indian subcontinent
the hellenistic period developed through the roman empire into modern western culture the greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the byzantine empire until its collapse in the mid th century ad
alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of achilles featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both greek and non greek cultures
his military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide
legends of alexanders exploits coalesced into the third century alexander romance which in the premodern period went through over one hundred recensions translations and derivations and was translated into almost every european vernacular and every language of the islamic world
after the bible it was the most popular form of european literature
alexander iii was born in pella the capital of the kingdom of macedon on the sixth day of the ancient greek month of hekatombaion which probably corresponds to july bc
he was the son of the erstwhile king of macedon philip ii and his fourth wife olympias
although philip had seven or eight wives olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to alexanderseveral legends surround alexanders birth and childhood
according to the ancient greek biographer plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to philip olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away
sometime after the wedding philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image
plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams that olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that alexanders father was zeus
ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious olympias promulgated the story of alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious
on the day alexander was born philip was preparing a siege on the city of potidea on the peninsula of chalcidice
that same day philip received news that his general parmenion had defeated the combined illyrian and paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the olympic games
it was also said that on this day the temple of artemis in ephesus one of the seven wonders of the world burnt down
this led hegesias of magnesia to say that it had burnt down because artemis was away attending the birth of alexander
such legends may have emerged when alexander was king and possibly at his instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception
in his early years alexander was raised by a nurse lanike sister of alexanders future general cleitus the black
later in his childhood alexander was tutored by the strict leonidas a relative of his mother and by lysimachus of acarnania
alexander was raised in the manner of noble macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt
when alexander was ten years old a trader from thessaly brought philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents
the horse refused to be mounted and philip ordered it away
alexander however detecting the horses fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed
plutarch stated that philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring my boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions
macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him
alexander named it bucephalas meaning ox head
bucephalas carried alexander as far as india
when the animal died alexander named a city after him bucephala
when alexander was philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as isocrates and speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the academy to take up the post
in the end philip chose aristotle and provided the temple of the nymphs at mieza as a classroom
in return for teaching alexander philip agreed to rebuild aristotles hometown of stageira which philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex citizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile
mieza was like a boarding school for alexander and the children of macedonian nobles such as ptolemy hephaistion and cassander
many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the companions
aristotle taught alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art
under aristotles tutelage alexander developed a passion for the works of homer and in particular the iliad aristotle gave him an annotated copy which alexander later carried on his campaigns
alexander was able to quote euripides from memory
in his youth alexander was also acquainted with persian exiles at the macedonian court who received the protection of philip ii for several years as they opposed artaxerxes iii
among them were artabazos ii and his daughter barsine possible future mistress of alexander who resided at the macedonian court from to bc as well as amminapes future satrap of alexander or a persian nobleman named sisines
this gave the macedonian court a good knowledge of persian issues and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the macedonian state
suda writes that anaximenes of lampsacus was one of alexanders teachers and that anaximenes also accompanied alexander on his campaigns
at the age of alexanders education under aristotle ended
philip ii had waged war against the thracians to the north which left alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent
during philips absence the thracian tribe of maedi revolted against macedonia
alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory
the territory was colonized and a city named alexandropolis was founded
upon philips return alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern thrace
campaigning against the greek city of perinthus alexander reportedly saved his fathers life
meanwhile the city of amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to apollo near delphi a sacrilege that gave philip the opportunity to further intervene in greek affairs
while philip was occupied in thrace alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern greece
concerned that other greek states might intervene alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack illyria instead
during this turmoil the illyrians invaded macedonia only to be repelled by alexander
philip and his army joined his son in bc and they marched south through thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its theban garrison
they went on to occupy the city of elatea only a few days march from both athens and thebes
the athenians led by demosthenes voted to seek alliance with thebes against macedonia
both athens and philip sent embassies to win thebess favour but athens won the contest
philip marched on amphissa capturing the mercenaries sent there by demosthenes and accepting the citys surrender
philip then returned to elatea sending a final offer of peace to athens and thebes who both rejected it
as philip marched south his opponents blocked him near chaeronea boeotia
during the ensuing battle of chaeronea philip commanded the right wing and alexander the left accompanied by a group of philips trusted generals
according to the ancient sources the two sides fought bitterly for some time
philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested athenian hoplites to follow thus breaking their line
alexander was the first to break the theban lines followed by philips generals
having damaged the enemys cohesion philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them
with the athenians lost the thebans were surrounded
left to fight alone they were defeated
after the victory at chaeronea philip and alexander marched unopposed into the peloponnese devastating much of laconia and ejecting the spartans from various parts of it
at corinth philip established a hellenic alliance which included most greek city states except sparta
philip was then named hegemon of this league and announced his plans to attack the persian empire
when philip returned to pella he fell in love with and married cleopatra eurydice in bc the niece of his general attalus
the marriage made alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of cleopatra eurydice would be a fully macedonian heir while alexander was only half macedonian
during the wedding banquet a drunken attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir
in bc alexander fled macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother king alexander i of epirus in dodona capital of the molossians
he continued to illyria where he sought refuge with one or more illyrian kings perhaps with glaucias and was treated as a guest despite having defeated them in battle a few years before
however it appears philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son
accordingly alexander returned to macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend demaratus who mediated between the two parties
in the following year the persian satrap of caria pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to alexanders half brother philip arrhidaeus
olympias and several of alexanders friends suggested this showed philip intended to make arrhidaeus his heir
alexander reacted by sending an actor thessalus of corinth to tell pixodarus that he should not offer his daughters hand to an illegitimate son but instead to alexander
when philip heard of this he stopped the negotiations and scolded alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a carian explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
philip exiled four of alexanders friends harpalus nearchus ptolemy and erigyius and had the corinthians bring thessalus to him in chains
in the summer of bc while at aegae attending the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to olympiass brother alexander i of epirus philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards pausanias
as pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of alexanders companions perdiccas and leonnatus
alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of
alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne
he had his cousin the former amyntas iv executed
he also had two macedonian princes from the region of lyncestis killed for having been involved in his fathers assassination but spared a third alexander lyncestes
olympias had cleopatra eurydice and europa her daughter by philip burned alive
when alexander learned about this he was furious
alexander also ordered the murder of attalus who was in command of the advance guard of the army in asia minor and cleopatras uncle
attalus was at that time corresponding with demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to athens
attalus also had severely insulted alexander and following cleopatras murder alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive
alexander spared arrhidaeus who was by all accounts mentally disabled possibly as a result of poisoning by olympias
news of philips death roused many states into revolt including thebes athens thessaly and the thracian tribes north of macedon
when news of the revolts reached alexander he responded quickly
though advised to use diplomacy alexander mustered macedonian cavalry and rode south towards thessaly
he found the thessalian army occupying the pass between mount olympus and mount ossa and ordered his men to ride over mount ossa
when the thessalians awoke the next day they found alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered adding their cavalry to alexanders force
he then continued south towards the peloponnese
alexander stopped at thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the amphictyonic league before heading south to corinth
athens sued for peace and alexander pardoned the rebels
the famous encounter between alexander and diogenes the cynic occurred during alexanders stay in corinth
when alexander asked diogenes what he could do for him the philosopher disdainfully asked alexander to stand a little to the side as he was blocking the sunlight
this reply apparently delighted alexander who is reported to have said but verily if i were not alexander i would like to be diogenes
at corinth alexander took the title of hegemon and like philip was appointed commander for the coming war against persia
he also received news of a thracian uprising
before crossing to asia alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders
in the spring of bc he advanced to suppress several revolts
starting from amphipolis he travelled east into the country of the independent thracians and at mount haemus the macedonian army attacked and defeated the thracian forces manning the heights
the macedonians marched into the country of the triballi and defeated their army near the lyginus river
alexander then marched for three days to the danube encountering the getae tribe on the opposite shore
crossing the river at night he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish
news then reached alexander that the illyrian chieftain cleitus and king glaukias of the taulantii were in open revolt against his authority
marching west into illyria alexander defeated each in turn forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops
with these victories he secured his northern frontier
while alexander campaigned north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again
alexander immediately headed south
while the other cities again hesitated thebes decided to fight
the theban resistance was ineffective and alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other boeotian cities
the end of thebes cowed athens leaving all of greece temporarily at peace
alexander then set out on his asian campaign leaving antipater as regent
after his victory at the battle of chaeronea philip ii began the work of establishing himself as hgemn of a league which according to diodorus was to wage a campaign against the persians for the sundry grievances greece suffered in and free the greek cities of the western coast and islands from achaemenid rule
in he sent parmenion amyntas andromenes attalus and an army of men into anatolia to make preparations for an invasion
the greek cities on the western coast of anatolia revolted until the news arrived that philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son alexander
the macedonians were demoralized by philips death and were subsequently defeated near magnesia by the achaemenids under the command of the mercenary memnon of rhodes
taking over the invasion project of philip ii alexanders army crossed the hellespont in bc with approximately soldiers cavalry and a fleet of ships with crews numbering drawn from macedon and various greek city states mercenaries and feudally raised soldiers from thrace paionia and illyria
he showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the persian empire by throwing a spear into asian soil and saying he accepted asia as a gift from the gods
this also showed alexanders eagerness to fight in contrast to his fathers preference for diplomacy
after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of the granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis he then proceeded along the ionian coast granting autonomy and democracy to the cities
miletus held by achaemenid forces required a delicate siege operation with persian naval forces nearby
further south at halicarnassus in caria alexander successfully waged his first large scale siege eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea
alexander left the government of caria to a member of the hecatomnid dynasty ada who adopted alexander
from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the persians naval bases
from pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and alexander moved inland
at termessos alexander humbled and did not storm the pisidian city
at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the hitherto unsolvable gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia
according to the story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword
in spring bc alexander crossed the taurus into cilicia
after a long pause due to an illness he marched on towards syria
though outmanoeuvered by dariuss significantly larger army he marched back to cilicia where he defeated darius at issus
darius fled the battle causing his army to collapse and left behind his wife his two daughters his mother sisygambis and a fabulous treasure
he offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost and a ransom of talents for his family
alexander replied that since he was now king of asia it was he alone who decided territorial divisions
alexander proceeded to take possession of syria and most of the coast of the levant
in the following year bc he was forced to attack tyre which he captured after a long and difficult siege
the men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery
when alexander destroyed tyre most of the towns on the route to egypt quickly capitulated
however alexander was met with resistance at gaza
the stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill requiring a siege
when his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible
this encouraged alexander all the more to make the attempt
after three unsuccessful assaults the stronghold fell but not before alexander had received a serious shoulder wound
as in tyre men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery
egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by alexander from the persians
after his trip to siwa alexander was crowned in the temple of ptah at memphis
it appears that the egyptian people did not find it disturbing that he was a foreigner nor that he was absent for virtually his entire reign
alexander restored the temples neglected by the persians and dedicated new monuments to the egyptian gods
in the temple of luxor near karnak he built a chapel for the sacred barge
during his brief months in egypt he reformed the taxation system on the greek models and organized the military occupation of the country but in early bc he left for asia in pursuit of the persians
alexander advanced on egypt in later bc where he was regarded as a liberator
to legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs alexander made sacrifices to the gods at memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of amun ra at the siwa oasis in the libyan desert at which he was pronounced the son of the deity amun
henceforth alexander often referred to zeus ammon as his true father and after his death currency depicted him adorned with horns using the horns of ammon as a symbol of his divinity
the greeks interpreted this message one that the gods addressed to all pharaohs as a prophecy
during his stay in egypt he founded alexandria which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic kingdom after his death
control of egypt passed to ptolemy i the founder of the ptolemaic dynasty after the death of alexander
leaving egypt in bc alexander marched eastward into achaemenid assyria in upper mesopotamia and defeated darius again at the battle of gaugamela
darius once more fled the field and alexander chased him as far as arbela
gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two
darius fled over the mountains to ecbatana while alexander captured babylon
babylonian astronomical diaries say that the king of the world alexander sent his scouts with a message to the people of babylon before entering the city i shall not enter your houses
from babylon alexander went to susa one of the achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury
he sent the bulk of his army to the persian ceremonial capital of persepolis via the persian royal road
alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city
he then stormed the pass of the persian gates which had been blocked by a persian army under ariobarzanes and then hurried to persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury
on entering persepolis alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days
alexander stayed in persepolis for five months
during his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes i and spread to the rest of the city
possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the acropolis of athens during the second persian war by xerxes plutarch and diodorus allege that alexanders companion the hetaera thas instigated and started the fire
even as he watched the city burn alexander immediately began to regret his decision
plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires but the flames had already spread to most of the city
curtius claims that alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning
plutarch recounts an anecdote in which alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of xerxes as if it were a live person alexander then chased darius first into media and then parthia
the persian king no longer controlled his own destiny and was taken prisoner by bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman
as alexander approached bessus had his men fatally stab the great king and then declared himself dariuss successor as artaxerxes v before retreating into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander
alexander buried dariuss remains next to his achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral
he claimed that while dying darius had named him as his successor to the achaemenid throne
the achaemenid empire is normally considered to have fallen with darius
however as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by alexander under his own rule he in the words of the iranologist pierre briant may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the achaemenids
alexander viewed bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him
this campaign initially against bessus turned into a grand tour of central asia
alexander founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate in modern tajikistan
the campaign took alexander through media parthia aria drangiana arachosia bactria and scythia
in bc spitamenes who held an undefined position in the satrapy of sogdiana betrayed bessus to ptolemy one of alexanders trusted companions and bessus was executed
however at some point later when alexander was on the jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army spitamenes raised sogdiana in revolt
alexander personally defeated the scythians at the battle of jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against spitamenes defeating him in the battle of gabai
after the defeat spitamenes was killed by his own men who then sued for peace
during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis either a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground that persians showed to their social superiors
this was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes
the greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it
this cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it
during the long rule of the achaemenids the elite positions in many segments of the empire including the central government the army and the many satrapies were specifically reserved for iranians and to a major degree persian noblemen
the latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal achaemenid family
this created a problem for alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time
pierre briant explains that alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in asia minor babylonia or egypt he also had to create a central government with or without the support of the iranians
as early as bc he demonstrated awareness of this when he challenged incumbent king darius iii by appropriating the main elements of the achaemenid monarchys ideology particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants
alexander wrote a letter in bc to darius iii wherein he argued that he was worthier than darius to succeed to the achaemenid throne
however alexanders eventual decision to burn the achaemenid palace at persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the entire persian people made it impracticable for him to pose himself as darius legitimate successor
against bessus however briant adds alexander reasserted his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of darius iii
a plot against his life was revealed and one of his officers philotas was executed for failing to alert alexander
the death of the son necessitated the death of the father and thus parmenion who had been charged with guarding the treasury at ecbatana was assassinated at alexanders command to prevent attempts at vengeance
most infamously alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at granicus cleitus the black during a violent drunken altercation at maracanda in which cleitus accused alexander of several judgmental mistakes and especially of having forgotten the macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle
later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life was revealed
this one was instigated by his own royal pages
his official historian callisthenes of olynthus was implicated in the plot and in the anabasis of alexander arrian states that callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment and likely died soon after
it remains unclear if callisthenes was actually involved in the plot for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis
when alexander set out for asia he left his general antipater an experienced military and political leader and part of philip iis old guard in charge of macedon
alexanders sacking of thebes ensured that greece remained quiet during his absence
the one exception was a call to arms by spartan king agis iii in bc whom antipater defeated and killed in the battle of megalopolis
antipater referred the spartans punishment to the league of corinth which then deferred to alexander who chose to pardon them
there was also considerable friction between antipater and olympias and each complained to alexander about the other
in general greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during alexanders campaign in asia
alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire
however alexanders constant demands for troops and the migration of macedonians throughout his empire depleted macedons strength greatly weakening it in the years after alexander and ultimately led to its subjugation by rome after the third macedonian war
the conquest by philip ii of pangaeum and then of the island of thasos between and bc brought rich gold and silver mines under macedonian control
alexander appears to have introduced a new coinage in cilicia in tarsus after the battle of issus in bc which went on to become the main coinage of the empire
alexander minted gold staters silver tetradrachms and drachims and various fractional bronze coins
the types of these coins remained constant in his empire
the gold series had the head of athena on the obverse and a winged nike on the reverse
the silver coinage had a beardless head of heracles wearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and zeus aetophoros enthroned with a scepter in his left hand on the reverse
there are both greek and non greek aspects to this design
heracles and zeus were important deities for the macedonians with heracles considered to be the ancestor of the temenid dynasty and zeus the patron of the main macedonian sanctuary dium
the lion was also the symbolic animal of the anatolian god sandas worshipped at tarsus
the reverse design of alexanders tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god baaltars on the silver staters minted at tarsus by the persian satrap mazaeus before alexanders conquest
alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests
persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire
after the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana to cement relations with his new satrapies alexander turned to the indian subcontinent
he invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of gandhara to come to him and submit to his authority
omphis the ruler of taxila whose kingdom extended from the indus to the hydaspes complied but the chieftains of some hill clans including the aspasioi and assakenoi sections of the kambojas refused to submit
ambhi hastened to relieve alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents placing himself and all his forces at his disposal
alexander not only returned ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of persian robes gold and silver ornaments horses and talents in gold
alexander was emboldened to divide his forces and ambhi assisted hephaestion and perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the indus where it bends at hund supplied their troops with provisions and he received alexander and his whole army in his capital city of taxila with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality
on the subsequent advance of the macedonian king taxiles accompanied him with a force of men and took part in the battle of the hydaspes
after that victory he was sent by alexander in pursuit of porus to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy
subsequently the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of alexander taxiles contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the hydaspes and was entrusted by alexander with the government of the whole territory between that river and the indus
a considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of philip son of machatas and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of alexander himself as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at triparadisus bc
in the winter of bc alexander personally led a campaign against the aspasioi of the kunar valley the guraeans of the guraeus valley and the assakenoi of the swat and buner valleys
a fierce contest ensued with the aspasioi in which alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the aspasioi lost
alexander then faced the assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of massaga ora and aornos
the fort of massaga was reduced after days of bloody fighting in which alexander was seriously wounded in the ankle
according to curtius not only did alexander slaughter the entire population of massaga but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble
a similar slaughter followed at ora
in the aftermath of massaga and ora numerous assakenians fled to the fortress of aornos
alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill fort after four bloody days
after aornos alexander crossed the indus and won an epic battle against king porus who ruled a region lying between the hydaspes and the acesines in what is now the punjab in the battle of the hydaspes in bc
alexander was impressed by poruss bravery and made him an ally
he appointed porus as satrap and added to poruss territory land that he did not previously own towards the south east up to the hyphasis
choosing a local helped him control these lands that were distant from greece
alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the hydaspes river naming one bucephala in honour of his horse who died around this time
the other was nicaea thought to be located at the site of modern day mong punjab
philostratus the elder in the life of apollonius of tyana writes that in the army of porus there was an elephant who fought bravely against alexanders army and alexander dedicated it to the helios and named it ajax because he thought that such a great animal deserved a great name
the elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in greek alexander the son of zeus dedicates ajax to the helios
east of poruss kingdom near the ganges river was the nanda empire of magadha and further east the gangaridai empire of bengal region of the indian subcontinent
fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning alexanders army mutinied at the hyphasis river refusing to march farther east
this river thus marks the easternmost extent of alexanders conquests
alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther but his general coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return the men he said longed to again see their parents their wives and children their homeland
alexander eventually agreed and turned south marching along the indus
along the way his army conquered the malhi and other indian tribes while besieging the mallian citadel alexander suffered a near fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung
alexander sent much of his army to carmania with general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest back to persia through the more difficult southern route along the gedrosian desert and makran
alexander reached susa in bc but not before losing many men to the harsh desert
discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to susa
as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send over aged and disabled veterans back to macedon led by craterus
his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis
they refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units
after three days unable to persuade his men to back down alexander gave persians command posts in the army and conferred macedonian military titles upon persian units
the macedonians quickly begged forgiveness which alexander accepted and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men
in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at susa but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year
meanwhile upon his return to persia alexander learned that guards of the tomb of cyrus the great in pasargadae had desecrated it and swiftly executed them
alexander admired cyrus the great from an early age reading xenophons cyropaedia which described cyruss heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator
during his visit to pasargadae alexander ordered his architect aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of cyruss tomb
afterwards alexander travelled to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure
there his closest friend hephaestion died of illness or poisoning
hephaestions death devastated alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in babylon along with a decree for public mourning
back in babylon alexander planned a series of new campaigns beginning with an invasion of arabia but he would not have a chance to realize them as he died shortly after hephaestion
on the evening of may alexander organized a banquet for his army to celebrate the end of the campaign of india and the onset of the invasion of the arabian peninsula
there is a tradition that they would only start serious drinking after everyone was done with their meals but the wine was usually heavily watered
before his death someone asked alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die he responded to the strongest one
he may have also added that there would be funeral games to be played after his death
on either or june bc alexander died in the palace of nebuchadnezzar ii in babylon at age
there are two different versions of alexanders death differing slightly in details
plutarchs account is that roughly days before his death alexander entertained admiral nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with medius of larissa
alexander developed a fever which worsened until he was unable to speak
the common soldiers anxious about his health were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them
in the second account diodorus recounts that alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of heracles followed by days of weakness he did not develop a fever instead dying after some agony
arrian also mentioned this as an alternative but plutarch specifically denied this claim
given the propensity of the macedonian aristocracy to assassination foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death
diodorus plutarch arrian and justin all mentioned the theory that alexander was poisoned
justin stated that alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication while both diodorus and arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness
the accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating antipater recently removed as macedonian viceroy replaced by craterus as the head of the alleged plot
perhaps taking his summons to babylon as a death sentence and having seen the fate of parmenion and philotas antipater purportedly arranged for alexander to be poisoned by his son iollas who was alexanders wine pourer
there was even a suggestion that aristotle may have participated
the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death such long acting poisons were probably not available
however in a bbc documentary investigating the death of alexander leo schep from the new zealand national poisons centre proposed that the plant white hellebore which was known in antiquity may have been used to poison alexander
in a manuscript in the journal clinical toxicology schep suggested alexanders wine was spiked with veratrum album and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the alexander romance
veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if alexander was poisoned veratrum album offers the most plausible cause
another poisoning explanation put forward in proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river styx that contained calicheamicin a dangerous compound produced by bacteria
several natural causes have been suggested including malaria and typhoid fever
a article in the new england journal of medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis
a analysis suggested pyogenic spondylitis or meningitis
other illnesses fit the symptoms including acute pancreatitis west nile virus and guillain barr syndrome
natural cause theories also tend to emphasize that alexanders health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds
the anguish that alexander felt after hephaestions death may also have contributed to his declining health
alexanders body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey which was in turn placed in a gold casket
according to aelian a seer called aristander foretold that the land where alexander was laid to rest would be happy and unvanquishable forever
perhaps more likely the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative
while alexanders funeral cortege was on its way to macedon ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to memphis
his successor ptolemy ii philadelphus transferred the sarcophagus to alexandria where it remained until at least late antiquity
ptolemy ix lathyros one of ptolemys final successors replaced alexanders sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage
the discovery of an enormous tomb in northern greece at amphipolis dating from the time of alexander the great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of alexander
this would fit with the intended destination of alexanders funeral cortege
however the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of alexander the great hephaestion
pompey julius caesar and augustus all visited the tomb in alexandria where augustus allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off
caligula was said to have taken alexanders breastplate from the tomb for his own use
around ad emperor septimius severus closed alexanders tomb to the public
his son and successor caracalla a great admirer visited the tomb during his own reign
after this details on the fate of the tomb are hazy
the so called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeology museum is so named not because it was thought to have contained alexanders remains but because its bas reliefs depict alexander and his companions fighting the persians and hunting
it was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of abdalonymus the king of sidon appointed by alexander immediately following the battle of issus in
however in it was suggested by karl schefold that it may date from earlier than abdalonymuss death
demades likened the macedonian army after the death of alexander to the blinded cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made
in addition leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals after alexanders death to the blinded cyclops who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him not knowing where to lay them
alexanders death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached greece they were not immediately believed
alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir his son alexander iv by roxane being born after alexanders death
according to diodorus alexanders companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom his laconic reply was ti kratisti to the strongest
another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard ti krateri to craterus the general leading his macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of macedonia
arrian and plutarch claimed that alexander was speechless by this time implying that this was an apocryphal story
diodorus curtius and justin offered the more plausible story that alexander passed his signet ring to perdiccas a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry in front of witnesses thereby nominating him
perdiccas initially did not claim power instead suggesting that roxanes baby would be king if male with himself craterus leonnatus and antipater as guardians
however the infantry under the command of meleager rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion
instead they supported alexanders half brother philip arrhidaeus
eventually the two sides reconciled and after the birth of alexander iv he and philip iii were appointed joint kings albeit in name only
dissension and rivalry soon affected the macedonians
the satrapies handed out by perdiccas at the partition of babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power
after the assassination of perdiccas in bc macedonian unity collapsed and years of war between the successors ensued before the hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs ptolemaic egypt seleucid syria and east and antigonid macedonia
in the process both alexander iv and philip iii were murdered
diodorus stated that alexander had given detailed written instructions to craterus some time before his death which are known as alexanders last plans
craterus started to carry out alexanders commands but the successors chose not to further implement them on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant
furthermore perdiccas had read the notebooks containing alexanders last plans to the macedonian troops in babylon who voted not to carry them out
according to diodorus alexanders last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western mediterranean monumental constructions and the intermixing of eastern and western populations
it included the enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity
ernst badian argued that they were exaggerated by perdiccas in order to ensure that the macedonian troops voted not to carry them out
other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the alexander romance
alexander perhaps earned the epithet the great due to his unparalleled success as a military commander he never lost a battle despite typically being outnumbered
this was due to use of terrain phalanx and cavalry tactics bold strategy and the fierce loyalty of his troops
the macedonian phalanx armed with the sarissa a spear long had been developed and perfected by philip ii through rigorous training and alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate persian forces
alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army which employed various languages and weapons
he overcame this by being personally involved in battle in the manner of a macedonian king
in his first battle in asia at granicus alexander used only a small part of his forces perhaps infantry with cavalry against a much larger persian force of
alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings so that his line matched the length of the persian cavalry line about
by contrast the persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry
this ensured that alexander would not be outflanked while his phalanx armed with long pikes had a considerable advantage over the persians scimitars and javelins
macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the persians
at issus in bc his first confrontation with darius he used the same deployment and again the central phalanx pushed through
alexander personally led the charge in the center routing the opposing army
at the decisive encounter with darius at gaugamela darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes
alexander arranged a double phalanx with the center advancing at an angle parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming
the advance was successful and broke dariuss center causing the latter to flee once again
when faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques such as in central asia and india alexander adapted his forces to his opponents style
thus in bactria and sogdiana alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements while massing his cavalry at the center
in india confronted by poruss elephant corps the macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants handlers
historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of alexanders appearance and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail
during his lifetime alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists of the time
this included commissioning sculptures by lysippos paintings by apelles and gem engravings by pyrgoteles
ancient authors recorded that alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image scholars today however find the claim dubious
nevertheless andrew stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits not least because of who they are commissioned by are always partisan and that artistic portrayals of alexander seek to legitimize him to interpret him to their audiences to answer their critiques and to persuade them of his greatness and thus should be considered within a framework of praise and blame in the same way sources such as praise poetry are
despite those caveats lysipposs sculpture famous for its naturalism as opposed to a stiffer more static pose is thought to be the most faithful depiction
both curtius and diodorus report a story that when darius iiis mother sisygambis first met alexander and hephaestion she assumed that the latter was alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two
historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes
the alexander mosaic and contemporary coins portray alexander with a straight nose a slightly protruding jaw full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead
he is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left
the ancient historian aelian in his varia historia describes alexanders hair color as which at the time could mean yellowish brownish or reddish
it is sometimes claimed that alexander had one blue and one brown eye referring to the alexander romance which is however a fictional account that also claims alexander had sharp teeth like fangs and did not look like philip or olympias
reconstruction based on remaining traces of paint of the original polychromy on his sarcophagus indicates that he was depicted with brown eyes and chestnut brown hair
both of alexanders parents encouraged his ambitions
his father philip was probably alexanders most immediate and influential role model as the young alexander watched him campaign practically every year winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds
alexanders relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality he had a need to outdo his father illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle
while alexander worried that his father would leave him no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world he also downplayed his fathers achievements to his companions
alexanders mother olympia similarly had huge ambitions and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the persian empire
she instilled a sense of destiny in him and plutarch tells how his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years
according to plutarch alexander also had a violent temper and rash impulsive nature which could influence his decision making
although alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father he was open to reasoned debate
he had a calmer side perceptive logical and calculating
he had a great desire for knowledge a love for philosophy and was an avid reader
this was no doubt in part due to aristotles tutelage alexander was intelligent and quick to learn
his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general
he had great self restraint in pleasures of the body in contrast with his lack of self control with alcohol
alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences
however he had little interest in sports or the olympic games seeking only the homeric ideals of honour and glory
he had great charisma and force of personality characteristics which made him a great leader
his unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite macedonia and retain the empire after his death only alexander had the ability to do so
during his final years and especially after the death of hephaestion alexander began to exhibit signs of and paranoia
his extraordinary achievements coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions may have combined to produce this effect
his delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition an epithet the meaning of which has descended into a historical clich
he appears to have believed himself a deity or at least sought to deify himself
olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of zeus a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of amun at siwa
he began to identify himself as the son of zeus ammon
alexander adopted elements of persian dress and customs at court notably proskynesis which was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the macedonians and they were unwilling to perform it
this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen
alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine
thus rather than megalomania his behaviour may have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together
alexander married three times roxana daughter of the sogdian nobleman oxyartes of bactria out of love and the persian princesses stateira and parysatis the former a daughter of darius iii and the latter a daughter of artaxerxes iii for political reasons
he apparently had two sons alexander iv of macedon by roxana and possibly heracles of macedon from his mistress barsine
he lost another child when roxana miscarried at babylon
alexander also had a close relationship with his friend general and bodyguard hephaestion the son of a macedonian noble
hephaestions death devastated alexander
this event may have contributed to alexanders failing health and detached mental state during his final months
alexanders sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times
the roman era writer athenaeus says based on the scholar dicaearchus who was alexanders contemporary that the king was quite excessively keen on boys and that alexander kissed the eunuch bagoas in public
this episode is also told by plutarch probably based on the same source
none of alexanders contemporaries however are known to have explicitly described alexanders relationship with hephaestion as sexual though the pair was often compared to achilles and patroclus who are often interpreted as a couple
aelian writes of alexanders visit to troy where alexander garlanded the tomb of achilles and hephaestion that of patroclus the latter hinting that he was a beloved of alexander in just the same way as patroclus was of achilles
some modern historians believe not only that alexanders youthful relationship with hephaestion was sexual but also that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood which went against the social norms of at least some greek cities such as athens though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that macedonia may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults
peter green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that alexander had much carnal interest in women he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life
however ogden calculates that alexander who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age
two of these pregnancies stateiras and barsines are of dubious legitimacy
according to diodorus siculus alexander accumulated a harem in the style of persian kings but he used it rather sparingly not wishing to offend the macedonians showing great self control in pleasures of the body
nevertheless plutarch described how alexander was infatuated by roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her
green suggested that in the context of the period alexander formed quite strong friendships with women including ada of caria who adopted him and even dariuss mother sisygambis who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of alexanders death
alexanders legacy extended beyond his military conquests and his reign marked a turning point in european and asian history
his campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between east and west and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to greek civilization and influence
some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers many surviving into the st century
his chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched while the greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the mediterranean
alexanders most immediate legacy was the introduction of macedonian rule to huge new swathes of asia
at the time of his death alexanders empire covered some and was the largest state of its time
many of these areas remained in macedonian hands or under greek influence for the next years
the successor states that emerged were at least initially dominant forces and these years are often referred to as the hellenistic period
the eastern borders of alexanders empire began to collapse even during his lifetime
however the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful indian dynasties in history the maurya empire
taking advantage of this power vacuum chandragupta maurya of relatively humble origin took control of the punjab and with that power base proceeded to conquer the nanda empire
over the course of his conquests alexander founded many cities that bore his name most of them east of the tigris
the first and greatest was alexandria in egypt which would become one of the leading mediterranean cities
the cities locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions
at first the cities must have been inhospitable little more than defensive garrisons
following alexanders death many greeks who had settled there tried to return to greece
however a century or so after alexanders death many of the alexandrias were thriving with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both greek and local peoples
in bc alexander the great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of athena polias in priene in modern day western turkey
an inscription from the temple now housed in the british museum declares king alexander dedicated temple to athena polias
this inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from alexanders life
the temple was designed by pytheos one of the architects of the mausoleum at halicarnassus
libanius wrote that alexander founded the temple of zeus bottiaios in the place where later the city of antioch was built
suda wrote that alexander built a big temple to sarapis
in british museum experts have suggested the possibility that a greek temple at girsu in iraq was founded by alexander
according to the researchers recent discoveries suggest that this site honours zeus and two divine sons
the sons are heracles and alexander
hellenization was coined by the german historian johann gustav droysen to denote the spread of greek language culture and population into the former persian empire after alexanders conquest
this process can be seen in such great hellenistic cities as alexandria antioch and seleucia
alexander sought to insert greek elements into persian culture and to hybridize greek and persian culture homogenizing the populations of asia and europe
although his successors explicitly rejected such policies hellenization occurred throughout the region accompanied by a distinct and opposite orientalization of the successor states
the core of the hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially athenian
the close association of men from across greece in alexanders army directly led to the emergence of the largely attic based koine or common greek dialect
koine spread throughout the hellenistic world becoming the lingua franca of hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern greek
furthermore town planning education local government and art current in the hellenistic period were all based on classical greek ideals evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as hellenistic
also the new testament was written in the koine greek language
aspects of hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the byzantine empire in the mid th century
some of the most pronounced effects of hellenization can be seen in afghanistan and india in the region of the relatively late rising greco bactrian kingdom and the indo greek kingdom in modern afghanistan and india
on the silk road trade routes hellenistic culture hybridized with iranian and buddhist cultures
the cosmopolitan art and mythology of gandhara of the rd century bc to the th century ad are most evident of the direct contact between hellenistic civilization and south asia as are the edicts of ashoka which directly mention the greeks within ashokas dominion as converting to buddhism and the reception of buddhist emissaries by ashokas contemporaries in the hellenistic world
the resulting syncretism known as greco buddhism influenced the development of buddhism and created a culture of greco buddhist art
these greco buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first buddhist missionaries to china sri lanka and hellenistic asia and europe
some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the buddha appeared at this time perhaps modelled on greek statues of apollo in the greco buddhist style
several buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient greek religion the concept of boddhisatvas is reminiscent of greek divine heroes and some mahayana ceremonial practices are similar to those practised by the ancient greeks however similar practices were also observed amongst the native indic culture
one greek king menander i probably became buddhist and was immortalized in buddhist literature as milinda
the process of hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west
for example greek astronomical instruments dating to the rd century bc were found in the greco bactrian city of ai khanoum in modern day afghanistan while the greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long standing indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain like the petals of a flower
the yavanajataka and paulisa siddhanta texts depict the influence of greek astronomical ideas on indian astronomy
following the conquests of alexander the great in the east hellenistic influence on indian art was far reaching
in architecture a few examples of the ionic order can be found as far as pakistan with the jandial temple near taxila
several examples of capitals displaying ionic influences can be seen as far as patna especially with the pataliputra capital dated to the rd century bc
the corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of gandhara especially through indo corinthian capitals
alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans especially generals who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements
polybius began his histories by reminding romans of alexanders achievements and thereafter roman leaders saw him as a role model
pompey the great adopted the epithet magnus and even alexanders anastole type haircut and searched the conquered lands of the east for alexanders year old cloak which he then wore as a sign of greatness
julius caesar dedicated a lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced alexanders head with his own while octavian visited alexanders tomb in alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to alexanders profile
the emperor trajan also admired alexander as did nero and caracalla
the macriani a roman family that in the person of macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne kept images of alexander on their persons either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes
on the other hand some roman writers particularly republican figures used alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values
alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as and but also and
emperor julian in his satire called the caesars describes a contest between the previous roman emperors with alexander the great called in as an extra contestant in the presence of the assembled gods
the itinerarium alexandri is a th century latin description of alexander the greats campaigns
julius caesar went to serve his quaestorship in hispania after his wifes funeral in the spring or early summer of bc
while there he encountered a statue of alexander the great and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when alexander had the world at his feet while he had achieved comparatively little
pompey posed as the new alexander since he was his boyhood hero
after caracalla concluded his campaign against the alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with alexander the great
he began openly mimicking alexander in his personal style
in planning his invasion of the parthian empire caracalla decided to arrange of his men in macedonian style phalanxes despite the roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation
the historian christopher matthew mentions that the term phalangarii has two possible meanings both with military connotations
the first refers merely to the roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes and the second bears similarity to the marian mules of the late roman republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole which were in use until at least the nd century ad
as a consequence the phalangarii of legio ii parthica may not have been pikemen but rather standard battle line troops or possibly triarii
caracallas mania for alexander went so far that caracalla visited alexandria while preparing for his persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the aristotelian school based on a legend that aristotle had poisoned alexander
this was a sign of caracallas increasingly erratic behaviour
but this mania for alexander strange as it was was overshadowed by subsequent events in alexandria
in caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons stretching for over two miles from the resort of baiae to the neighbouring port of puteoli
it was said that the bridge was to rival the persian king xerxes pontoon bridge crossing of the hellespont
caligula who could not swim then proceeded to ride his favourite horse incitatus across wearing the breastplate of alexander the great
this act was in defiance of a prediction by tiberiuss soothsayer thrasyllus of mendes that caligula had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the bay of baiae
the diffusion of greek culture and language cemented by alexanders conquests in west asia and north africa served as a precondition for the later roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the byzantine empire according to errington
alexander wrote and received numerous letters but no originals survive
a few official letters addressed to the greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources
these only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are
several fictitious letters some perhaps based on actual letters made their way into the romance tradition
many of the legends about alexander derive from his own lifetime probably encouraged by alexander himself
his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis
writing shortly after alexanders death onesicritus invented a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons
he reportedly read this passage to his patron king lysimachus who had been one of alexanders generals and who quipped i wonder where i was at the time
in the first centuries after alexanders death probably in alexandria a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to callisthenes and therefore known as pseudo callisthenes
this text underwent over one hundred recensions translations and derivations throughout the islamic and european worlds in premodern times containing many dubious stories and was translated into twenty five languages for example middle persian syriac and arabic
alexander the greats accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures
alexander has featured in both high and popular culture beginning from his own era to the present day
the alexander romance in particular has had a significant impact on portrayals of alexander in later cultures from persian to medieval european to modern greek
alexander features prominently in modern greek folklore more than any other ancient figure
the colloquial form of his name in modern greek is a household name and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the karagiozis shadow play
one well known fable among greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ships prow during a storm and ask the captain is king alexander alive the answer should be he is alive and well and rules the world causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm
any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea all hands aboard
in pre islamic middle persian literature alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak meaning accursed and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of zoroastrianism
in islamic persia under the influence of the alexander romance a more positive portrayal of alexander emerges
firdausis shahnameh includes alexander in a line of legitimate persian shahs a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the fountain of youth
in the shahnameh alexanders first journey is to mecca to pray at the kaaba
alexander was depicted as performing a hajj many times in subsequent islamic art and literature
later persian writers associate him with philosophy portraying him at a symposium with figures such as socrates plato and aristotle in search of immortality
the figure of dhu al qarnayn is believed by the majority of modern researchers of the quran as well as islamic commentators to be a reference to alexander
the figure is also believed by scholars to be based on later legends of alexander
in this tradition he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of gog and magog
he also travelled the known world in search of the water of life and immortality eventually becoming a prophet
the syriac version of the alexander romance portrays him as an ideal christian world conqueror who prayed to the one true god
in egypt alexander was portrayed as the son of nectanebo ii the last pharaoh before the persian conquest
his defeat of darius was depicted as egypts salvation proving egypt was still ruled by an egyptian
according to josephus alexander was shown the book of daniel when he entered jerusalem which described a mighty greek king who would conquer the persian empire
this is cited as a reason for sparing jerusalem
in hindi and urdu the name sikandar derived from the persian name for alexander denotes a rising young talent and the delhi sultanate ruler alauddin khalji stylized himself as sikandar i sani
in medieval india turkic and afghan sovereigns from the iranian cultured region of central asia brought positive cultural connotations of alexander to the indian subcontinent resulting in the efflorescence of sikandernameh written by indo persian poets such as amir khusrau and the prominence of alexander the great as a popular subject in mughal era persian miniatures
in medieval europe alexander the great was revered as a member of the nine worthies a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry
during the first italian campaign of the french revolutionary wars in a question from bourrienne asking whether he gave his preference to alexander or caesar napoleon said that he places alexander the great in the first rank the main reason being his campaign on asia
in the greek anthology there are poems referring to alexander
throughout time art objects related to alexander were being created
in addition to speech works sculptures and paintings in modern times alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works
the song alexander the great by the british heavy metal band iron maiden is indicative
some films that have been shot with the theme of alexander are there are also many references to other movies and tv series
the trilogy alexander the great by valerio massimo manfredi consisting of the son of the dream the sand of amon and the ends of the world
the trilogy of mary renault consisting of fire from heaven the persian boy and funeral games
irish playwright aubrey thomas de vere wrote alexander the great a dramatic poem
apart from a few inscriptions and fragments texts written by people who actually knew alexander or who gathered information from men who served with alexander were all lost
contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included alexanders campaign historian callisthenes alexanders generals ptolemy and nearchus aristobulus a junior officer on the campaigns and onesicritus alexanders chief helmsman
their works are lost but later works based on these original sources have survived
the earliest of these is diodorus siculus followed by quintus curtius rufus arrian the biographer plutarch and finally justin whose work dated as late as the th century
of these arrian is generally considered the most reliable given that he used ptolemy and aristobulus as his sources closely followed by diodorus
alfred habdank skarbek korzybski was a polish american independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics which he viewed as both distinct from and more encompassing than the field of semantics
he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed and thus no one can have direct access to reality given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brains responses to reality
his best known dictum is the map is not the territory
born in warsaw vistula country which was then part of the russian empire korzybski belonged to an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations
he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools and having a french and german governess he became fluent in four languages as a child
korzybski studied engineering at the warsaw university of technology
during the first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army
after being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries he moved to north america in to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia
he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds
after the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming a naturalized citizen in
he met mira edgerly a painter of portraits on ivory shortly after the armistice they married in january the marriage lasted until his death
dutton published korzybskis first book manhood of humanity in
in this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind mankind as a time binding class of life
in and korzybski observed psychiatric patients at st
elizabeths hospital in dc under the supervision of william alanson white
korzybskis work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics
this should not be confused with semantics
the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are described in the publication science and sanity published in
in korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago
the post world war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institutes building lease so in he moved the institute to lakeville connecticut us where he directed it until his death in
korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by the structure of their nervous systems and the structure of their languages
humans cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions
these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth
our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening
he sought to train our awareness of abstracting using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science
he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting
his system included the promotion of attitudes such as i dont know lets see in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science
another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience he termed silence on the objective levels
many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form is of the general verb to be
his system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different orders of abstraction and formulations such as consciousness of abstracting
the contention that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be would be a profound exaggeration
he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure eg a statement such as elizabeth is a fool
in korzybskis system ones assessment of elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself
korzybskis remedy was to deny identity in this example to be aware continually that elizabeth is not what we call her
we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain
this was expressed by korzybskis most famous premise the map is not the territory
note that this premise uses the phrase is not a form of to be this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon to be as such
in fact he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb to be when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location
it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb to be as long as one was aware of their structural limitations
one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase
he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit
a few students took a biscuit
nice biscuit dont you think said korzybski while he took a second one
the students were chewing vigorously
then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging
on it was a big picture of a dogs head and the words dog cookies
the students looked at the package and were shocked
two of them wanted to vomit put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet
you see korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people dont just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter
william burroughs went to a korzybski workshop in the autumn of
he was years old and paid
his fellow students there were in all included young samuel i
hayakawa and wendell johnson
korzybskis work received positive reactions from a variety of individuals in the s and s
robert a
heinlein named a character after him in his short story blowups happen and science fiction writer a
van vogt in his novel the world of null a published in
on march fellow science fiction author l
ron hubbard wrote to heinlein referencing korzybski as an influence on what would become dianetics korzybskis ideas influenced philosopher alan watts who used his phrase the map is not the territory in lectures
writer robert anton wilson was also deeply influenced by korzybskis ideas
as reported in the third edition of science and sanity in world war ii the us army used korzybskis system to treat battle fatigue in europe under the supervision of dr douglas m
kelley who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the nazi war criminals at nuremberg
some of the general semantics tradition was continued by samuel i
asteroids is a space themed multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by lyle rains and ed logg released in november by atari inc
the player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers
the object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers counter fire
the game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases
asteroids was conceived during a meeting between logg and rains who decided to use hardware developed by howard delman previously used for lunar lander
asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled cosmos its physics model control scheme and gameplay elements were derived from spacewar computer space and space invaders and refined through trial and error
the game is rendered on a vector display in a two dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes
asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games the game sold upright cabinets and cocktail cabinets arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers
in the s it was ported to ataris home systems and the atari vcs version sold over three million copies
the game was widely imitated and it directly influenced defender gravitar and many other video games
the objective of asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers
the player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right fire shots straight forward and thrust forward
once the ship begins moving in a direction it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction
the ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting
the player can also send the ship into hyperspace causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen at the risk of self destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid
each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen
objects wrap around screen edges for instance an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction
as the player shoots asteroids they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit
smaller asteroids are also worth more points
two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen the big saucer shoots randomly and poorly while the small saucer fires frequently at the ship
after reaching a score of only the small saucer appears
as the players score increases the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately
once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers a new set of large asteroids appears thus starting the next level
the game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between and
the player starts with lives upon game start and gains an extra life per points
play continues to the last ship lost which ends the game
the machine turns over at points which is the maximum high score that can be achieved
in the original game design saucers were supposed to begin shooting as soon as they appeared but this was changed
additionally saucers can only aim at the players ship on screen they are not capable of aiming across a screen boundary
these behaviors allow a lurking strategy in which the player stays near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer
by keeping just one or two rocks in play a player can shoot across the boundary and destroy saucers to accumulate points indefinitely with little risk of being destroyed
arcade operators began to complain about losing revenue due to this exploit
in response atari issued a patched eprom and due to the impact of this exploit atari changed their development and testing policies to try to prevent future games from having such exploits
asteroids was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg with collaborations from other atari staff
logg was impressed with the atari video computer system and he joined ataris coin op division to work on dirt bike which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test
paul mancuso joined the development team as asteroids technician and engineer howard delman contributed to the hardware
during a meeting in april rains discussed planet grab a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to cosmos
the unfinished game featured a giant indestructible asteroid
logg did play cosmos and remembered shooting the indestructible asteroid to no effect
so rains asked logg well why dont we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up in response logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces
thus combining the two dimensional approach of space war with space invaders addictive gameplay of completion and eliminate all threats
both agreed on the concept
asteroids was implemented on hardware developed by delman and is a vector game in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor
rains initially wanted the game done in raster graphics but logg experienced in vector graphics suggested an xy monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming
the hardware is chiefly a mos executing the game program and quadrascan a high resolution vector graphics processor developed by atari and referred to as an xy display system and the digital vector generator
the original design concepts for quadrascan came out of cyan engineering ataris off campus research lab in grass valley california in
cyan gave it to delman who finished the design and first used it for lunar lander
logg received delmans modified board with five buttons sound effects and additional ram and he used it to develop asteroids
the size of the board was by inches and it was linked up to a monitor
logg modeled the players ship the five button control scheme and the game physics after spacewar which he had played as a student at the university of california berkeley but made several changes to improve playability
the ship was programmed into the hardware and rendered by the monitor and it was configured to move with thrust and inertia
the hyperspace button was not placed near loggs right thumb which he was dissatisfied with as he had a problem tak his hand off the thrust button
drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game
logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from exidys star fire
the two saucers were formulated to be different from each other
a steadily decreasing timer shortens intervals between saucer attacks to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers
a heartbeat soundtrack quickens as the game progresses
the game does not have a sound chip
delman created a hardware circuit for sound effects by hand which was wired onto the board
a prototype of asteroids was well received by several atari staff and engineers who wander between labs passing comment and stopping to play as they went
logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype so he created a second prototype for staff to play
atari tested the game in arcades in sacramento california and also observed players during focus group sessions at atari
players used to spacewar struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick players accustomed to space invaders noted they get no break in the game
logg and other engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages
asteroids slows down as the player gains lives because there is no limit to the number of lives displayed
the player can lose the game after more than lives are collected
asteroids was released for the atari vcs and atari bit computers in then the atari in
a port for the atari identical to the atari bit computer version was in development in but was not published
the atari version was a launch title and includes cooperative play the asteroids have colorful textures and the heartbeat sound effect remains intact
programmers brad stewart and bob smith were unable to fit the atari vcs port into a kb cartridge
it became the first game for the console to use bank switching a technique that increases rom size from kb to kb
asteroids was immediately successful upon release
it displaced space invaders by popularity in the united states and became ataris best selling arcade game of all time with over units sold
atari earned an estimated million in sales from the game and arcade operators earned a further million from coin drops
atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game lunar lander but demand for asteroids was so high that several hundred asteroids games were shipped in lunar lander cabinets
asteroids was so popular that some video arcade operators had to install large boxes to hold the number of coins spent by players
it replaced space invaders at the top of the us replay amusement arcade charts in april though space invaders remained the top game at street locations
asteroids went on to become the highest grossing arcade video game of in the united states dethroning space invaders
it shipped arcade units worldwide in including over sold in the united states that year and grossed about worldwide by
the game remained at the top of the us replay charts through march
the game did not perform as well overseas in europe and asia
it sold arcade units overseas for a total of arcade units sold worldwide
atari manufactured units from its us and ireland plants including asteroids deluxe units
it was a commercial failure in japan when it released there in partly due to its complex controls and partly due to the japanese market beginning to lose interest in space shoot em ups at the time
asteroids received positive reviews from video game critics and has been regarded as loggs magnum opus
richard a
edwards reviewed the asteroids home cartridge in the space gamer no
edwards commented that this home cartridge is a virtual duplicate of the ever popular atari arcade game
if blasting asteroids is the thing you want to do then this is the game but at this price i cant wholeheartedly recommend it
video games player magazine reviewed the atari vcs version rating the graphics and sound a b while giving the game an overall b rating
electronic fun with computers games magazine gave the atari vcs version an a rating
william cassidy writing for gamespys classic gaming noticed its innovations including being one of the first video games to track initials and allow players to enter their initials for appearing in the top high scores and commented that the vector graphics fit the futuristic outer space theme very well
in flux magazine ranked the arcade version th on their top video games
in next generation listed it as number on their top games of all time particularly lauding the control dynamics which require the constant juggling of speed positioning and direction
in next generation listed asteroids as number on their top games of all time commenting that asteroids was a classic the day it was released and it has never lost any of its appeal
asteroids was ranked fourth on retro gamers list of top arcade games the retro gamer staff cited its simplicity and the lack of a proper ending as allowances of revisiting the game
in asteroids was listed on time all time greatest video games list
entertainment weekly named asteroids one of the top ten games for the atari in
it was added to the museum of modern arts collection of video games
in the guardian listed asteroids as the second greatest video game of the s just below galaxian
by contrast in march the atari bit port of asteroids won sixth place in softlines dog of the year awards for badness in computer games atari division based on reader submissions
usage of the names of saturday night live characters mr bill and sluggo to refer to the saucers in an esquire article about the game led to logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a lawyer with the mr bill trademark
released in asteroids deluxe was the first sequel to asteroids
dave shepperd edited the code and made enhancements to the game without loggs involvement
the onscreen objects are tinted blue and hyperspace is replaced by a shield that depletes when used
the asteroids rotate and new killer satellite enemies break into smaller ships that home in on the players position
the arcade machines monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop
the game is more difficult than the original and enables saucers to shoot across the screen boundary eliminating the lurking strategy for high scores in the original
space duel released in arcades in replaces the rocks with colorful geometric shapes and adds cooperative two player gameplay

three clones for the apple ii were reviewed together in the creative computing software buyers guide the asteroid field asteron and apple oids
in the last of these the asteroids are in the shape of apples
two independent clones asteroid for the apple ii and fasteroids for trs were renamed to planetoids and sold by adventure international
others clones include acornsofts meteors moons of jupiter for the vic minestorm for the vectrex and quicksilvas meteor storm for the zx spectrum which uses speech synthesis
a poorly implemented asteroids clone for the vic published by bug byte motivated jeff minter to found llamasoft
the intellivision game meteor was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit for being too similar to asteroids and was reworked as astrosmash
the game borrows elements from asteroids and space invaders

asparagales is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the angiosperm phylogeny group and the angiosperm phylogeny web
the order takes its name from the type family asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots
the order has only recently been recognized in classification systems
it was first put forward by huber in and later taken up in the dahlgren system of and then the apg in and
before this many of its families were assigned to the old order liliales a very large order containing almost all monocots with colorful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm
dna sequence analysis indicated that many of the taxa previously included in liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders liliales asparagales and dioscoreales
the boundaries of the asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability
in the apg circumscription asparagales is the largest order of monocots with families genera and about species
the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse
most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials although some are climbers and some are trees or shrubs
the order also contains many geophytes
according to telomere sequence at least two evolutionary switch points happened within the order
the basal sequence is formed by tttaggg like in the majority of higher plants
basal motif was changed to vertebrate like ttaggg and finally the most divergent motif ctcggttatggg appears in allium
one of the defining characteristics of the order is the presence of phytomelanin a black pigment present in the seed coat creating a dark crust
phytomelanin is found in most families of the asparagales
the leaves of almost all species form a tight rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem but occasionally along the stem
the flowers are not particularly distinctive being lily type with six tepals and up to six stamina
the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some million years ago although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved estimates are likely to be uncertain
from an economic point of view the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots only to the order poales
species are used as food and flavourings in medicinal or cosmetic applications as cut flowers and as garden ornamentals
although most species in the order are herbaceous some no more than cm high there are a number of climbers as well as several genera forming trees which can exceed m in height
succulent genera occur in several families
almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more or less woody stem as with yucca
in some cases the leaves are produced along the stem
the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive being of a general lily type with six tepals either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina
they are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem
the asparagales are generally distinguished from the liliales by the lack of markings on the tepals the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments and the presence of secondary growth
they are generally geophytes but with linear leaves and a lack of fine reticular venation
the seeds characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated or if present have a layer of black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits
the inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed in contrast to liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis lack phytomelanin and usually display a cellular inner layer
the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize
no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales
as circumscribed within the angiosperm phylogeny group system asparagales is the largest order within the monocotyledons with families genera and about species thus accounting for about of all monocots and of the flowering plants
the attribution of botanical authority for the name asparagales belongs to johann heinrich friedrich link who coined the word asparaginae in for a higher order taxon that included asparagus although adanson and jussieau had also done so earlier
earlier circumscriptions of asparagales attributed the name to bromhead who had been the first to use the term asparagales
the type genus asparagus from which the name of the order is derived was described by carl linnaeus in with ten species
he placed asparagus within the hexandria monogynia in his sexual classification in the species plantarum
the majority of taxa now considered to constitute asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family liliaceae
the family liliaceae was first described by michel adanson in and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it including the asparagi with asparagus and three other genera
the system of organising genera into families is generally credited to antoine laurent de jussieu who formally described both the liliaceae and the type family of asparagales the asparagaceae as lilia and asparagi respectively in
jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy placing asparagus and related genera within a division of monocotyledons a class of stamina perigynia and order asparagi divided into three subfamilies
the use of the term ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as family rather than order
in creating his scheme he used a modified form of linnaeus sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers
while de jussieus stamina perigynia also included a number of orders that would eventually form families within the asparagales such as the asphodeli narcissi and irides the remainder are now allocated to other orders
jussieus asparagi soon came to be referred to as asparagaces in the french literature
meanwhile the narcissi had been renamed as the amaryllides in by jean henri jaume saint hilaire using amaryllis as the type species rather than narcissus and thus has the authority attribution for amaryllidaceae
in brown proposed that a subgroup of liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the ovaries and be referred to as amaryllideae and in de candolle described liliaces juss
and amaryllides brown as two quite separate families
the literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the english language with samuel frederick grays a natural arrangement of british plants
gray used a combination of linnaeus sexual classification and jussieus natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid but did not use formal names for these higher ranks
within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed
he treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families such as amaryllideae liliaceae asphodeleae and asparageae
the circumscription of asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of john lindley the other important british taxonomist of the early nineteenth century
in his first taxonomic work an introduction to the natural system of botany he partly followed jussieu by describing a subclass he called endogenae or monocotyledonous plants divided into two tribes the petaloidea and glumaceae
he divided the former often referred to as petaloid monocots into orders including the liliaceae but also most of the families considered to make up the asparagales today including the amaryllideae
by in his final scheme lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots introducing both an intermediate ranking and tribes within orders
lindley placed the liliaceae within the liliales but saw it as a paraphyletic family being all liliales not included in the other orders but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better
the order liliales was very large and included almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm
the liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups
this kept the liliaceae separate from the amaryllidaceae
of these liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes and amaryllidaceae into four tribes yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each others contemporary orders
the liliaceae would be reduced to a small core represented by the tribe tulipae while large groups such scilleae and asparagae would become part of asparagales either as part of the amaryllidaceae or as separate families
while of the amaryllidaceae the agaveae would be part of asparagaceae but the alstroemeriae would become a family within the liliales
the number of known genera continued to grow and by the time of the next major british classification that of the bentham hooker system in several of lindleys other families had been absorbed into the liliaceae
they used the term series to indicate suprafamilial rank with seven series of monocotyledons but did not use lindleys terms for these
however they did place the liliaceous and amaryllidaceous genera into separate series
the liliaceae were placed in series coronariae while the amaryllideae were placed in series epigynae
the liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes and the amaryllideae of five
an important addition to the treatment of the liliaceae was the recognition of the allieae as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the asparagales as the subfamily allioideae of the amaryllidaceae
the appearance of charles darwins origin of species in changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata
the darwinian approach led to the concept of phylogeny in assembling classification systems starting with eichler
eichler having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons further divided into former into seven orders
within the liliiflorae were seven families including liliaceae and amaryllidaceae
liliaceae included allium and ornithogalum and asparagus
engler in his system developed eichlers ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including die natrlichen pflanzenfamilien and syllabus der pflanzenfamilien
in his treatment of liliiflorae the liliineae were a suborder which included both families liliaceae and amaryllidaceae
the liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the amaryllidaceae four
in this rearrangement of liliaceae with fewer subdivisions the core liliales were represented as subfamily lilioideae the asparagae were represented as asparagoideae and the allioideae was preserved representing the alliaceous genera
allieae agapantheae and gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily
in the amaryllidaceae there was little change from the bentham hooker
a similar approach was adopted by wettstein
in the twentieth century the wettstein system placed many of the taxa in an order called liliiflorae
next johannes paulus lotsy proposed dividing the liliiflorae into a number of smaller families including asparagaceae
then herbert huber following lotsys example proposed that the liliiflorae be split into four groups including the asparagoid liliiflorae
the widely used cronquist system used the very broadly defined order liliales
these various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact till that of dahlgren incorporating new information including synapomorphy
dahlgren developed hubers ideas further and popularised them with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units
they created a new order calling it asparagales
this was one of five orders within the superorder liliiflorae
where cronquist saw one family dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders
over the s in the context of a more general review of the classification of angiosperms the liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny
by the end of that decade the royal botanic gardens at kew the british museum of natural history and the edinburgh botanical gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria
that committee finally recommended that new families be created in the place of the original broad liliaceae largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families
the order asparagales as currently circumscribed has only recently been recognized in classification systems through the advent of phylogenetics
the s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants
the establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as cronquist and thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data
this complicated the discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring
rbcl gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the liliales in
from four morphological orders sensu dahlgren
the largest clade representing the liliaceae all previously included in liliales but including both the calochortaceae and liliaceae sensu tamura
this redefined family that became referred to as core liliales but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the angiosperm phylogeny group
the revision of the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg iii places the order in the clade monocots
from the dahlgren system of onwards studies based mainly on morphology had identified the asparagales as a distinct group but had also included groups now located in liliales pandanales and zingiberales
research in the st century has supported the monophyly of asparagales based on morphology s rdna and other dna sequences although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that asparagales may be paraphyletic with orchidaceae separated from the rest
within the monocots asparagales is the sister group of the commelinid clade
this cladogram shows the placement of asparagales within the orders of lilianae sensu chase reveal based on molecular phylogenetic evidence
the lilioid monocot orders are bracketed namely petrosaviales dioscoreales pandanales liliales and asparagales
these constitute a paraphyletic assemblage that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants to form a clade all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included
while acorales and alismatales have been collectively referred to as alismatid monocots the remaining clades have been referred to as the core monocots
the relationship between the orders is that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids
numbers indicate crown group divergence times in mya
a phylogenetic tree for the asparagales generally to family level but including groups which were recently and widely treated as families but which are now reduced to subfamily rank is shown below
the tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group the lower asparagales from orchidaceae to asphodelaceae and a well supported monophyletic group of core asparagales comprising the two largest families amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato
two differences between these two groups are the mode of microsporogenesis and the position of the ovary
the lower asparagales typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots whereas the core asparagales have reverted to successive microsporogenesis
the lower asparagales typically have an inferior ovary whereas the core asparagales have reverted to a superior ovary
a morphological study by rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the asparagales stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the core asparagales could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries
however stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the lower asparagales in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies
the position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character than previously thought
the apg iii system when it was published in greatly expanded the families xanthorrhoeaceae amaryllidaceae and asparagaceae
thirteen of the families of the earlier apg ii system were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families
the expanded xanthorrhoeaceae is now called asphodelaceae
the apg ii families and their equivalent apg iii subfamilies are as follows orchidaceae is possibly the largest family of all angiosperms and hence by far the largest in the order
the dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids but dna sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined
several studies suggest that orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the asparagales
other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree generally among the boryaceae hypoxidaceae clade
the position of orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis but cannot be taken as confirmed
orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries two characters that are typical of the lower asparagales
however their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries and most orchids have dust like seeds atypical of the rest of the order
in terms of the number of species orchidaceae diversification is remarkable with recent estimations suggesting that despite the old origin of the family dating back to the late cretaceous modern orchid diversity originated mostly during the last million years
however although the other asparagales may be less rich in species they are more variable morphologically including tree like forms
the four families excluding boryaceae form a well supported clade in studies based on dna sequence analysis
all four contain relatively few species and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name hypoxidaceae sensu lato
the relationship between boryaceae and other asparagales has remained unclear for a long time
the boryaceae are mycorrhizal but not in the same way as orchids
morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between boryaceae and blandfordiaceae
there is relatively low support for the position of boryaceae in the tree shown above
the relationship shown between ixioliriaceae and tecophilaeaceae is still unclear
some studies have supported a clade of these two families others have not
the position of doryanthaceae has also varied with support for the position shown above but also support for other positions
the clade from iridaceae upwards appears to have stronger support
all have some genetic characteristics in common having lost arabidopsis type telomeres
iridaceae is distinctive among the asparagales in the unique structure of the inflorescence the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other asparagales
members of the clade from iridaceae upwards have infra locular septal nectaries which rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries
the next node in the tree has strong support
anomalous secondary thickening occurs among this clade eg in xanthorrhoea and dracaena with species reaching tree like proportions
the core asparagales comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato are a strongly supported clade as are clades for each of the families
relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear particularly within the asparagaceae sensu lato
stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified
thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above based on apweb is somewhat uncertain
several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the asparagales based on phylogenetic evidence
earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies which have been preferred in the table below
a study suggests that the asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots about the same as the order poales although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the eudicot order lamiales the clade with the highest rate
the taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by kubitzki
up to date information on the asparagales can be found on the angiosperm phylogeny website
the apg iii systems family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the kew hosted world checklist of selected plant families
with this circumscription the order consists of families with approximately genera and species
order asparagales link the earlier version apg ii allowed bracketed families ie families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them
these are the families given under including in the list above
apg iii does not allow bracketed families requiring the use of the more comprehensive family otherwise the circumscription of the asparagales is unchanged
a separate paper accompanying the publication of the apg iii system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued
the first apg system of contained some extra families included in square brackets in the list above
two older systems which use the order asparagales are the dahlgren system and the kubitzki system
the families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below
the equivalent family in the modern apg iii system is shown in the third column
note that although these systems may use the same name for a family the genera which it includes may be different so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases
the asparagales include many important crop plants and ornamental plants
crops include allium asparagus and vanilla while ornamentals include irises hyacinths and orchids
the alismatales are an order of flowering plants including about species
plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic
some grow in fresh water some in marine habitats
perhaps the most important food crop in the order is the taro plant colocasia esculenta
the alismatales comprise herbaceous flowering plants of often aquatic and marshy habitats and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the amaryllidaceae
they also include the only marine angiosperms growing completely submerged the seagrasses
the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm
both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface
there they can pollinate carpellate flowers floating on the surface via long pedicels
in others pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands increasing chance of success
most aquatic species have a totally submerged juvenile phase and flowers are either floating or emerge above the waters surface
vegetation may be totally submersed have floating leaves or protrude from the water
collectively they are commonly known as water plantain
the alismatales contain about genera in families with a cosmopolitan distribution
phylogenetically they are basal monocots diverging early in evolution relative to the lilioid and commelinid monocot lineages
together with the acorales the alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots
cronquists subclass alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order alismatales as defined by apg minus the araceae
in tahktajans classification the order alismatales contains only the alismataceae and limnocharitaceae making it equivalent to the alismataceae as revised in apg iii
other families included in the alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among additional orders all of which are assigned with the following exception to the subclass alismatidae
araceae in tahktajan is assigned to the arales and placed in the subclass aridae tofieldiaceae to the melanthiales and placed in the liliidae
the angiosperm phylogeny group system of and apg ii assigned the alismatales to the monocots which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below
the biggest departure from earlier systems is the inclusion of family araceae
by its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species
the family araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera totaling over two thousand species
the rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species many of which are in very small families
the apg iii system differs only in that the limnocharitaceae are combined with the alismataceae it was also suggested that the genus maundia could be separated into a monogeneric family the maundiaceae but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the maundiaceae could be recognized
in apg iv it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate maundia to family level as the monogeneric maundiaceae
the authors considered including a number of the smaller orders within the juncaginaceae but an online survey of botanists and other users found little support for this lumping approach
consequently the family structure for apg iv is the apiales are an order of flowering plants
the families are those recognized in the apg iii system
this is typical of the newer classifications though there is some slight variation and in particular the torriceliaceae may also be divided
under this definition well known members include carrots celery parsley and hedera helix
the order apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the apg iii system
within the asterids apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids and within the campanulids it belongs to a clade known in phylogenetic nomenclature as apiidae
in a subclade of apiidae named dipsapiidae was defined to consist of the three orders apiales paracryphiales and dipsacales
under the cronquist system only the apiaceae and araliaceae were included here and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids
the pittosporaceae were placed within the rosales and many of the other forms within the family cornaceae
pennantia was in the family icacinaceae
in the classification system of dahlgren the families apiaceae and araliaceae were placed in the order ariales in the superorder araliiflorae
the present understanding of the apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of dna sequences by phylogenetic methods
the circumscriptions of some of the families have changed
in one of the subfamilies of araliaceae was shown to be polyphyletic
the largest and obviously closely related families of apiales are araliaceae myodocarpaceae and apiaceae which resemble each other in the structure of their gynoecia
in this respect however the pittosporaceae is notably distinct from them
typical syncarpous gynoecia exhibit four vertical zones determined by the extent of fusion of the carpels
in most plants the synascidiate and symplicate zones are fertile and bear the ovules
each of the first three families possess mainly bi or multilocular ovaries in a gynoecium with a long synascidiate but very short symplicate zone where the ovules are inserted at their transition the so called cross zone
in gynoecia of the pittosporaceae the symplicate is much longer than the synascidiate zone and the ovules are arranged along the first
members of the latter family consequently have unilocular ovaries with a single cavity between adjacent carpels
asterales is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family asteraceae known for composite flowers made of florets and ten families related to the asteraceae
while asterids in general are characterized by fused petals composite flowers consisting of many florets create the false appearance of separate petals
the order is cosmopolitan and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees and shrubs are also present
asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor
asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels
synapomorphies include the presence in the plants of oligosaccharide inulin a nutrient storage molecule used instead of starch and unique stamen morphology
the stamens are usually found around the style either aggregated densely or fused into a tube probably an adaptation in association with the plunger pollination that is common among the families of the order wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil
the name and order asterales is botanically venerable dating back to at least in the hutchinson system of plant taxonomy when it contained only five families of which only two are retained in the apg iii classification
under the cronquist system of taxonomic classification of flowering plants asteraceae was the only family in the group but newer systems have expanded it to
in the classification system of rolf dahlgren the asterales were in the superorder asteriflorae
the order asterales currently includes families the largest of which are the asteraceae with about species and the campanulaceae with about species
the remaining families count together for less than species
the two large families are cosmopolitan with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere and the smaller families are usually confined to australia and the adjacent areas or sometimes south america
only the asteraceae have composite flower heads the other families do not but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the rosids
the phylogenetic tree according to apg iii for the campanulid clade is as below
although most extant species of asteraceae are herbaceous the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant a tree or shrub perhaps adapted to dry conditions radiating from south america
less can be said about the asterales themselves with certainty although since several families in asterales contain trees the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub
because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them
asterales are angiosperms flowering plants that appeared about million years ago
the asterales order probably originated in the cretaceous on the supercontinent gondwana which broke up from mya forming the area that is now australia south america africa india and antarctica
asterales contain about of eudicot diversity
from an analysis of relationships and diversities within the asterales and with their superorders estimates of the age of the beginning of the asterales have been made which range from mya to mya
however few fossils have been found of the menyanthaceae asteraceae clade in the oligocene about mya
fossil evidence of the asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs so the precise estimation of the orders age is quite difficult
an oligocene pollen is known for asteraceae and goodeniaceae and seeds from oligocene and miocene are known for menyanthaceae and campanulaceae respectively
the core asterales are stylidiaceae apa clade mgca clade and asteraceae
other asterales are rousseaceae campanulaceae and pentaphragmataceae
all asterales families are represented in the southern hemisphere however asteraceae and campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and menyanthaceae nearly so
the asterales by dint of being a super set of the family asteraceae include some species grown for food including the sunflower lettuce and chicory
many are also used as spices and traditional medicines
asterales are common plants and have many known uses
for example pyrethrum is a natural insecticide with minimal environmental impact
wormwood derived from a genus that includes the sagebrush is used as a source of flavoring for absinthe a bitter classical liquor of european origin
an asteroid is a minor planet an object that is neither a true planet nor an identified comet that orbits within the inner solar system
they are rocky metallic or icy bodies with no atmosphere
the size and shape of asteroids vary significantly ranging from small rubble piles under a kilometer across and larger than meteoroids to ceres a dwarf planet almost km in diameter
of the roughly one million known asteroids the greatest number are located between the orbits of mars and jupiter approximately to au from the sun in a region known as the main asteroid belt
asteroids are generally classified to be of three types c type m type and s type
these describe asteroids with carbonaceous metallic and silicaceous compositions respectively
the size of asteroids varies greatly the largest ceres is almost across and qualifies as a dwarf planet
the total mass of all the asteroids combined is only that of earths moon
the majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical stable orbits revolving in the same direction as the earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the sun
asteroids have historically been observed from earth
the first close up observation of an asteroid was made by the galileo spacecraft
several dedicated missions to asteroids were subsequently launched by nasa and jaxa with plans for other missions in progress
nasas near shoemaker studied eros and dawn observed vesta and ceres
jaxas missions hayabusa and hayabusa studied and returned samples of itokawa and ryugu respectively
osiris rex studied bennu collecting a sample in which was delivered back to earth in
nasas lucy launched in is tasked with studying ten different asteroids two from the main belt and eight jupiter trojans
psyche launched in october aims to study a metallic asteroid of the same name
near earth asteroids can threaten all life on the planet an asteroid impact event may have resulted in the cretaceous paleogene extinction
different asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the double asteroid redirection test spacecraft or dart was launched in and intentionally impacted dimorphos in september successfully altering its orbit by crashing into it
the first discovered asteroid ceres was originally considered a new planet
it was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions
this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term asteroid coined in greek as or asteroeids meaning star like star shaped and derived from the ancient greek astr star planet
in the early second half of the th century the terms asteroid and planet were still used interchangeably
traditionally small bodies orbiting the sun were classified as comets asteroids or meteoroids with anything smaller than one meter across being called a meteoroid
the term asteroid never had a formal definition with the broader term small solar system bodies being preferred by the international astronomical union
as no iau definition exists asteroid can be defined as an irregularly shaped rocky body orbiting the sun that does not qualify as a planet or a dwarf planet under the iau definitions of those terms
when found asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets and there was no unified term for the two until small solar system body was coined in
the main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation
a few objects have ended up being dual listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity
conversely some comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroid like
a further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids asteroids with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets
for almost two centuries from the discovery of ceres in until the discovery of the first centaur chiron in all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of jupiter though a few such as hidalgo ventured far beyond jupiter for part of their orbit
when astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than jupiter now called centaurs they numbered them among the traditional asteroids
there was debate over whether these objects should be considered asteroids or given a new classification
then when the first trans neptunian object albion was discovered in and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up new terms were invented to sidestep the issue kuiper belt object trans neptunian object scattered disc object and so on
they inhabit the cold outer reaches of the solar system where ices remain solid and comet like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity if centaurs or trans neptunian objects were to venture close to the sun their volatile ices would sublimate and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids
the innermost of these are the kuiper belt objects called objects partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets
they are thought to be predominantly comet like in composition though some may be more akin to asteroids
furthermore most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei
other recent observations such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the stardust probe are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids suggesting a continuum between asteroids and comets rather than a sharp dividing line
the minor planets beyond jupiters orbit are sometimes also called asteroids especially in popular presentations
however it is becoming increasingly common for the term asteroid to be restricted to minor planets of the inner solar system
therefore this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids objects of the asteroid belt jupiter trojans and near earth objects
when the iau introduced the class small solar system bodies in to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets they created the class of dwarf planets for the largest minor planets those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity
according to the iau the term minor planet may still be used but generally the term small solar system body will be preferred
currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres at about across has been placed in the dwarf planet category
despite their large numbers asteroids are a relatively recent discovery with the first known asteroid ceres only being identified in
only one asteroid vesta which has a relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye
when favorably positioned vesta can be seen in dark skies
rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short amount of time
the minor planet center had data on minor planets in the inner and outer solar system of which about had enough information to be given numbered designations
in german astronomer johann elert bode citing johann daniel titius published a numerical procession known as the titius bode law
except for an unexplained gap between mars and jupiter bodes formula seemed to predict the orbits of the known planets
he wrote the following explanation for the existence of a missing planet this latter point seems in particular to follow from the astonishing relation which the known six planets observe in their distances from the sun
let the distance from the sun to saturn be taken as then mercury is separated by such parts from the sun
venus is
the earth
now comes a gap in this so orderly progression
after mars there follows a space of parts in which no planet has yet been seen
can one believe that the founder of the universe had left this space empty certainly not
from here we come to the distance of jupiter by parts and finally to that of saturn by parts
bodes formula predicted another planet would be found with an orbital radius near astronomical units or million km from the sun
the titius bode law got a boost with william herschels discovery of uranus near the predicted distance for a planet beyond saturn
in a group headed by franz xaver von zach editor of the german astronomical journal monatliche correspondenz sent requests to experienced astronomers asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet
although they did not discover ceres they later found the asteroids pallas juno and vesta
one of the astronomers selected for the search was giuseppe piazzi a catholic priest at the academy of palermo sicily
before receiving his invitation to join the group piazzi discovered ceres on january
he was searching for the th of the catalogue of the zodiacal stars of mr la caille but found that it was preceded by another
instead of a star piazzi had found a moving star like object which he first thought was a comet the light was a little faint and of the colour of jupiter but similar to many others which generally are reckoned of the eighth magnitude
therefore i had no doubt of its being any other than a fixed star
the evening of the third my suspicion was converted into certainty being assured it was not a fixed star
nevertheless before i made it known i waited till the evening of the fourth when i had the satisfaction to see it had moved at the same rate as on the preceding days
piazzi observed ceres a total of times the final time on february when illness interrupted his work
he announced his discovery on january in letters to only two fellow astronomers his compatriot barnaba oriani of milan and bode in berlin
he reported it as a comet but since its movement is so slow and rather uniform it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet
in april piazzi sent his complete observations to oriani bode and french astronomer jrme lalande
the information was published in the september issue of the monatliche correspondenz
by this time the apparent position of ceres had changed and was too close to the suns glare for other astronomers to confirm piazzis observations
toward the end of the year ceres should have been visible again but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position
to recover ceres mathematician carl friedrich gauss then years old developed an efficient method of orbit determination
in a few weeks he predicted the path of ceres and sent his results to von zach
on december von zach and fellow celestial policeman heinrich w
olbers found ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it
at au from the sun ceres appeared to fit the titius bode law almost perfectly however neptune once discovered in was au closer than predicted leading most astronomers to conclude that the law was a coincidence
piazzi named the newly discovered object ceres ferdinandea in honor of the patron goddess of sicily and of king ferdinand of bourbon
three other asteroids were discovered by von zachs group over the next few years with vesta found in
no new asteroids were discovered until
amateur astronomer karl ludwig hencke started his searches of new asteroids in and fifteen years later while looking for vesta he found the asteroid later named astraea
it was the first new asteroid discovery in years
carl friedrich gauss was given the honor of naming the asteroid
after this other astronomers joined asteroids were found by the end of
in when james craig watson discovered the th asteroid the french academy of sciences engraved the faces of karl theodor robert luther john russell hind and hermann goldschmidt the three most successful asteroid hunters at that time on a commemorative medallion marking the event
in max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long exposure photographic plates
this dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods wolf alone discovered asteroids beginning with brucia whereas only slightly more than had been discovered up to that point
it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them some calling them vermin of the skies a phrase variously attributed to eduard suess and edmund weiss
even a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named
in the past asteroids were discovered by a four step process
first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide field telescope or astrograph
pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart
multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days
second the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope
a body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films
under the stereoscope the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars
third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope
the location would be measured relative to known star locations
these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a letter representing the half month of discovery and finally a letter and a number indicating the discoverys sequential number
the last step is sending the locations and time of observations to the minor planet center where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit
if so the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the international astronomical union
by the royal astronomical society decided that asteroids were being discovered at such a rapid rate that a different system was needed to categorize or name asteroids
in when de gasparis discovered the twentieth asteroid benjamin valz gave it a name and a number designating its rank among asteroid discoveries massalia
sometimes asteroids were discovered and not seen again
so starting in new asteroids were listed by the year and a capital letter indicating the order in which the asteroids orbit was calculated and registered within that specific year
for example the first two asteroids discovered in were labeled a and b
however there were not enough letters in the alphabet for all of the asteroids discovered in so z was followed by aa
a number of variations of these methods were tried including designations that included year plus a greek letter in
a simple chronological numbering system was established in
currently all newly discovered asteroids receive a provisional designation consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half month of discovery and the sequence within that half month
once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name
the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number eg eros but dropping the parentheses is quite common
informally it is also common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text
in addition names can be proposed by the asteroids discoverer within guidelines established by the international astronomical union
the first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets
by there were two dozen asteroid symbols which often occurred in multiple variants
in after the fifteenth asteroid eunomia had been discovered johann franz encke made a major change in the upcoming edition of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch
he introduced a disk a traditional symbol for a star as the generic symbol for an asteroid
the circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid
the numbered circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers and the next asteroid to be discovered was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery
however psyche was given an iconic symbol as well as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years
massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol and no iconic symbols were created after the discovery of fides
many asteroids are the shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young suns solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets
it is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of objects in the solar nebula until jupiter neared its current mass at which point excitation from orbital resonances with jupiter ejected over of planetesimals in the belt
simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately in diameter accreted during that early era whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the jovian disruption
ceres and vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core leaving rocky minerals in the crust
in the nice model many kuiper belt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt at distances greater than au
most were later ejected by jupiter but those that remained may be the d type asteroids and possibly include ceres
various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner solar system
their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the yarkovsky effect
significant populations include the majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter generally in relatively low eccentricity orbits
this belt is estimated to contain between and million asteroids larger than in diameter and millions of smaller ones
these asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by jupiter
contrary to popular imagery the asteroid belt is mostly empty
the asteroids are spread over such a large volume that reaching an asteroid without aiming carefully would be improbable
nonetheless hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known and the total number ranges in the millions or more depending on the lower size cutoff
over asteroids are known to be larger than km and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between and million asteroids with a diameter of km or more
the absolute magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are between and with the median at about
the total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be kg which is just of the mass of the moon the mass of the kuiper belt and scattered disk is over times as large
the four largest objects ceres vesta pallas and hygiea account for maybe of the belts total mass with accounted for by ceres alone
trojans are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two lagrangian points of stability and which lie ahead of and behind the larger body
in the solar system most known trojans share the orbit of jupiter
they are divided into the greek camp at and the trojan camp at
more than a million jupiter trojans larger than one kilometer are thought to exist of which more than are currently catalogued
in other planetary orbits only nine mars trojans neptune trojans two uranus trojans and two earth trojans have been found to date
a temporary venus trojan is also known
numerical orbital dynamics stability simulations indicate that saturn and uranus probably do not have any primordial trojans
near earth asteroids or neas are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of earth
asteroids that actually cross earths orbital path are known as earth crossers
a total of near earth asteroids were known have a diameter of one kilometer or larger
a small number of neas are extinct comets that have lost their volatile surface materials although having a faint or intermittent comet like tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a near earth comet making the boundaries somewhat fuzzy
the rest of the near earth asteroids are driven out of the asteroid belt by gravitational interactions with jupiter
many asteroids have natural satellites
there were neas known to have at least one moon including three known to have two moons
the asteroid florence one of the largest potentially hazardous asteroids with a diameter of has two moons measuring across which were discovered by radar imaging during the asteroids approach to earth
it is unclear whether martian moons phobos and deimos are captured asteroids or were formed due to impact event on mars
phobos and deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous c type asteroids with spectra albedo and density very similar to those of c or d type asteroids
based on their similarity one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main belt asteroids
both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in marss equatorial plane and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces although it is not clear whether sufficient time was available for this to occur for deimos
capture also requires dissipation of energy
the current martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a phobos sized object by atmospheric braking
geoffrey a
landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces
phobos could be a second generation solar system object that coalesced in orbit after mars formed rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as mars
another hypothesis is that mars was once surrounded by many phobos and deimos sized bodies perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal
the high porosity of the interior of phobos is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin
observations of phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates which are well known from the surface of mars
the spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites again pointing away from an asteroidal origin
both sets of findings support an origin of phobos from material ejected by an impact on mars that reaccreted in martian orbit similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of earths moon
asteroids vary greatly in size from almost for the largest down to rocks just meter across below which an object is classified as a meteoroid
the three largest are very much like miniature planets they are roughly spherical have at least partly differentiated interiors and are thought to be surviving protoplanets
the vast majority however are much smaller and are irregularly shaped they are thought to be either battered planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies
the dwarf planet ceres is by far the largest asteroid with a diameter of
the next largest are vesta and pallas both with diameters of just over
vesta is the brightest of the four main belt asteroids that can on occasion be visible to the naked eye
on some rare occasions a near earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid see apophis
the mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt lying between the orbits of mars and jupiter is estimated to be of the mass of the moon
of this ceres comprises about of the total
adding in the next three most massive objects vesta pallas and hygiea brings this figure up to a bit over whereas the next seven most massive asteroids bring the total up to
the number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease
the number of asteroids decreases markedly with increasing size
although the size distribution generally follows a power law there are bumps at about and where more asteroids than expected from such a curve are found
most asteroids larger than approximately km in diameter are primordial whereas most smaller asteroids are products of fragmentation of primordial asteroids
the primordial population of the main belt was probably times what it is today
three largest objects in the asteroid belt ceres vesta and pallas are intact protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly shaped asteroids
the fourth largest asteroid hygiea appears nearly spherical although it may have an undifferentiated interior like the majority of asteroids
the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt
ceres is the only asteroid that appears to have a plastic shape under its own gravity and hence the only one that is a dwarf planet
it has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids of around and may possess a surface layer of ice
like the planets ceres is differentiated it has a crust a mantle and a core
no meteorites from ceres have been found on earth
vesta too has a differentiated interior though it formed inside the solar systems frost line and so is devoid of water its composition is mainly of basaltic rock with minerals such as olivine
aside from the large crater at its southern pole rheasilvia vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape
vesta is the parent body of the vestian family and other v type asteroids and is the source of the hed meteorites which constitute of all meteorites on earth
pallas is unusual in that like uranus it rotates on its side with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane
its composition is similar to that of ceres high in carbon and silicon and perhaps partially differentiated
pallas is the parent body of the palladian family of asteroids
hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and unlike the other largest asteroids lies relatively close to the plane of the ecliptic
it is the largest member and presumed parent body of the hygiean family of asteroids
because there is no sufficiently large crater on the surface to be the source of that family as there is on vesta it is thought that hygiea may have been completely disrupted in the collision that formed the hygiean family and recoalesced after losing a bit less than of its mass
observations taken with the very large telescopes sphere imager in and revealed that hygiea has a nearly spherical shape which is consistent both with it being in hydrostatic equilibrium or formerly being in hydrostatic equilibrium or with being disrupted and recoalescing
internal differentiation of large asteroids is possibly related to their lack of natural satellites as satellites of main belt asteroids are mostly believed to form from collisional disruption creating a rubble pile structure
measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit
very few asteroids with a diameter larger than meters have a rotation period less than hours
for asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force so any loose surface material would be flung out
however a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly
this suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over meters are rubble piles formed through the accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids
asteroids become darker and redder with age due to space weathering
however evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly in the first hundred thousand years limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids
except for the big four asteroids are likely to be broadly similar in appearance if irregular in shape
mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroids radius
earth based observations of davida one of the largest asteroids after the big four reveal a similarly angular profile suggesting it is also saturated with radius size craters
medium sized asteroids such as mathilde and ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface
of the big four pallas and hygiea are practically unknown
vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid
dawn spacecraft revealed that ceres has a heavily cratered surface but with fewer large craters than expected
models based on the formation of the current asteroid belt had suggested ceres should possess to craters larger than in diameter
the largest confirmed crater on ceres kerwan basin is across
the most likely reason for this is viscous relaxation of the crust slowly flattening out larger impacts
asteroids are classified by their characteristic emission spectra with the majority falling into three main groups c type m type and s type
these describe carbonaceous metallic and silicaceous compositions respectively
the physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood
ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle vesta is thought to have a nickel iron core olivine mantle and basaltic crust
thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid hygiea seems to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite but it may actually be a differentiated asteroid that was globally disrupted by an impact and then reassembled
other asteroids appear to be the remnant cores or mantles of proto planets high in rock and metal
most small asteroids are believed to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity although the largest are probably solid
some asteroids have moons or are co orbiting binaries rubble piles moons binaries and scattered asteroid families are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid or possibly a planet
in the main asteroid belt there appear to be two primary populations of asteroid a dark volatile rich population consisting of the c type and p type asteroids with albedos less than and densities under and a dense volatile poor population consisting of the s type and m type asteroids with albedos over and densities greater than within these populations larger asteroids are denser presumably due to compression
there appears to be minimal macro porosity in the score of asteroids with masses greater than
composition is calculated from three primary sources albedo surface spectrum and density
the last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have
so far every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume
the investigated asteroids are as large as km in diameter and include hermione and sylvia
few asteroids are larger than sylvia none of them have moons
the fact that such large asteroids as sylvia may be rubble piles presumably due to disruptive impacts has important consequences for the formation of the solar system computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge
this means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly
scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the moon
in the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of themis using nasas infrared telescope facility
the surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice
as this ice layer is sublimating it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface
organic compounds were also detected on the surface
the presence of ice on themis makes the initial theory plausible
in october water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf gd
on january european space agency scientists reported the detection for the first definitive time of water vapor on ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt
the detection was made by using the far infrared abilities of the herschel space observatory
the finding is unexpected because comets not asteroids are typically considered to sprout jets and plumes
according to one of the scientists the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids
findings have shown that solar winds can react with the oxygen in the upper layer of the asteroids and create water
it has been estimated that every cubic metre of irradiated rock could contain up to litres study was conducted using an atom probe tomography numbers are given for the itokawa s type asteroid
acfer a meteorite discovered in algeria in was shown in to have an ultraporous lithology porous texture that could be formed by removal of ice that filled these pores this suggests that upl represent fossils of primordial ice
asteroids contain traces of amino acids and other organic compounds and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life or may have even brought life itself to earth
in august a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna and rna components may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space
in november scientists reported detecting for the first time sugar molecules including ribose in meteorites suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio ingredients important to life and supporting the notion of an rna world prior to a dna based origin of life on earth and possibly as well the notion of panspermia
asteroids are commonly categorized according to two criteria the characteristics of their orbits and features of their reflectance spectrum
many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics
apart from the broadest divisions it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered
groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past
families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt but several small families have been reported among the jupiter trojans
main belt families were first recognized by kiyotsugu hirayama in and are often called hirayama families in his honor
about of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids
a family has also been associated with the plutoid dwarf planet
some asteroids have unusual horseshoe orbits that are co orbital with earth or another planet
examples are cruithne and
the first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between saturns moons epimetheus and janus
sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasi satellites for a few decades or a few hundred years before returning to their earlier status
both earth and venus are known to have quasi satellites
such objects if associated with earth or venus or even hypothetically mercury are a special class of aten asteroids
however such objects could be associated with the outer planets as well
in an asteroid taxonomic system based on color albedo and spectral shape was developed by chapman morrison and zellner
these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroids surface material
the original classification system had three categories c types for dark carbonaceous objects s types for stony objects and u for those that did not fit into either c or s
this classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types
the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied
the two most widely used taxonomies now used are the tholen classification and smass classification
the former was proposed in by david j
tholen and was based on data collected from an eight color asteroid survey performed in the s
this resulted in asteroid categories
in the small main belt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted in a modified version of the tholen taxonomy with different types
both systems have three broad categories of c s and x asteroids where x consists of mostly metallic asteroids such as the m type
there are also several smaller classes
the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals
originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroids composition
however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and a variety of classifications are in use
this has led to significant confusion
although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of the same materials
active asteroids are objects that have asteroid like orbits but show comet like visual characteristics
that is they show comae tails or other visual evidence of mass loss but their orbit remains within jupiters orbit
these bodies were originally designated main belt comets in by astronomers david jewitt and henry hsieh but this name implies they are necessarily icy in composition like a comet and that they only exist within the main belt whereas the growing population of active asteroids shows that this is not always the case
the first active asteroid discovered is elst pizarro
it was discovered in but then was found to have a tail by eric elst and guido pizarro in and given the cometary designation p elst pizarro
another notable object is p panstarrs observations made by the hubble space telescope revealed that it had six comet like tails
the tails are suspected to be streams of material ejected by the asteroid as a result of a rubble pile asteroid spinning fast enough to remove material from it
by smashing into the asteroid dimorphos nasas double asteroid redirection test spacecraft made it an active asteroid
scientists had proposed that some active asteroids are the result of impact events but no one had ever observed the activation of an asteroid
the dart mission activated dimorphos under precisely known and carefully observed impact conditions enabling the detailed study of the formation of an active asteroid for the first time
observations show that dimorphos lost approximately million kilograms after the collision
impact produced a dust plume that temporarily brightened the didymos system and developed a long dust tail that persisted for several months
until the age of space travel objects in the asteroid belt could only be observed with large telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery
the best modern ground based telescopes and the earth orbiting hubble space telescope can only resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids
limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves and their spectral properties
sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occultations
radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters especially for near earth asteroids
spacecraft flybys can provide much more data than any ground or space based observations sample return missions gives insights about regolith composition
as asteroids are rather small and faint objects the data that can be obtained from ground based observations are limited
by means of ground based optical telescopes the visual magnitude can be obtained when converted into the absolute magnitude it gives a rough estimate of the asteroids size
light curve measurements can also be made by gbo when collected over a long period of time it allows an estimate of the rotational period the pole orientation and a rough estimate of the asteroids shape
spectral data gives information about the objects composition used to classify the observed asteroids
such observations are limited as they provide information about only the thin layer on the surface
as planetologist patrick michel writes mid to thermal infrared observations along with polarimetry measurements are probably the only data that give some indication of actual physical properties
measuring the heat flux of an asteroid at a single wavelength gives an estimate of the dimensions of the object these measurements have lower uncertainty than measurements of the reflected sunlight in the visible light spectral region
if the two measurements can be combined both the effective diameter and the geometric albedo the latter being a measure of the brightness at zero phase angle that is when illumination comes from directly behind the observer can be derived
in addition thermal measurements at two or more wavelengths plus the brightness in the visible light region give information on the thermal properties
the thermal inertia which is a measure of how fast a material heats up or cools off of most observed asteroids is lower than the bare rock reference value but greater than that of the lunar regolith this observation indicates the presence of an insulating layer of granular material on their surface
moreover there seems to be a trend perhaps related to the gravitational environment that smaller objects have a small regolith layer consisting of coarse grains while larger objects have a thicker regolith layer consisting of fine grains
however the detailed properties of this regolith layer are poorly known from remote observations
moreover the relation between thermal inertia and surface roughness is not straightforward so one needs to interpret the thermal inertia with caution
near earth asteroids that come into close vicinity of the planet can be studied in more details with radar it provides information about the surface of the asteroid
such observations were conducted by the arecibo observatory in puerto rico and goldstone observatory in california
radar observations can also be used for accurate determination of the orbital and rotational dynamics of observed objects
both space and ground based observatories conducted asteroid search programs the space based searches are expected to detect more objects because there is no atmosphere to interfere and because they can observe larger portions of the sky
neowise observed more than asteroids of the main belt spitzer space telescope observed more than near earth asteroids
these observations determined rough sizes of the majority of observed objects but provided limited detail about surface properties
asteroids were also studied by the hubble space telescope such as tracking the colliding asteroids in the main belt break up of an asteroid observing an active asteroid with six comet like tails and observing asteroids that were chosen as targets of dedicated missions
according to patrick michel the internal structure of asteroids is inferred only from indirect evidence bulk densities measured by spacecraft the orbits of natural satellites in the case of asteroid binaries and the drift of an asteroids orbit due to the yarkovsky thermal effect
a spacecraft near an asteroid is perturbed enough by the asteroids gravity to allow an estimate of the asteroids mass
the volume is then estimated using a model of the asteroids shape
mass and volume allow the derivation of the bulk density whose uncertainty is usually dominated by the errors made on the volume estimate
the internal porosity of asteroids can be inferred by comparing their bulk density with that of their assumed meteorite analogues dark asteroids seem to be more porous than bright ones
the nature of this porosity is unclear
the first asteroid to be photographed in close up was gaspra in followed in by ida and its moon dactyl all of which were imaged by the galileo probe en route to jupiter
other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include braille annefrank teins and lutetia and toutatis
the first dedicated asteroid probe was nasas near shoemaker which photographed mathilde in before entering into orbit around eros finally landing on its surface in
it was the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid
from september to november the japanese hayabusa probe studied itokawa in detail and returned samples of its surface to earth on june the first asteroid sample return mission
in nasa launched the dawn spacecraft which orbited vesta for a year and observed the dwarf planet ceres for three years
hayabusa a probe launched by jaxa orbited its target asteroid ryugu for more than a year and took samples that were delivered to earth in
the spacecraft is now on an extended mission and expected to arrive at a new target in
nasa launched the osiris rex in a sample return mission to asteroid bennu
in the probe departed the asteroid with a sample from its surface
sample was delivered to earth in september
the spacecraft continues its extended mission designated osiris apex to explore near earth asteroid apophis in
in nasa launched double asteroid redirection test a mission to test technology for defending earth against potential hazardous objects
dart deliberately crashed into the minor planet moon dimorphos of the double asteroid didymos in september to assess the potential of a spacecraft impact to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with earth
in october nasa declared dart a success confirming it had shortened dimorphos orbital period around didymos by about minutes
the concept of asteroid mining was proposed in s
matt anderson defines successful asteroid mining as the development of a mining program that is both financially self sustaining and profitable to its investors
it has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth or materials for constructing space habitats
materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for space manufacturing and construction
as resource depletion on earth becomes more real the idea of extracting valuable elements from asteroids and returning these to earth for profit or using space based resources to build solar power satellites and space habitats becomes more attractive
hypothetically water processed from ice could refuel orbiting propellant depots
from the astrobiological perspective asteroid prospecting could provide scientific data for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
some astrophysicists have suggested that if advanced extraterrestrial civilizations employed asteroid mining long ago the hallmarks of these activities might be detectable
there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earths and that could given enough time collide with earth
the three most important groups of near earth asteroids are the apollos amors and atens
the near earth asteroid eros had been discovered as long ago as and the s brought a flurry of similar objects
in order of discovery these were amor apollo adonis and finally hermes which approached within au of earth in
astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact
two events in later decades increased the alarm the increasing acceptance of the alvarez hypothesis that an impact event resulted in the cretaceous paleogene extinction and the observation of comet shoemaker levy crashing into jupiter
the us military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across
all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys consisting of charge coupled device cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes
it was estimated that to of near earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered
the linear system alone had discovered asteroids
among the surveys near earth asteroids have been discovered including almost more than in diameter
in june the national science and technology council warned that the united states is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national near earth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare
according to expert testimony in the united states congress in nasa would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched
various collision avoidance techniques have different trade offs with respect to metrics such as overall performance cost failure risks operations and technology readiness
there are various methods for changing the course of an asteroid comet
these can be differentiated by various types of attributes such as the type of mitigation energy source and approach strategy
strategies fall into two basic sets fragmentation and delay
fragmentation concentrates on rendering the impactor harmless by fragmenting it and scattering the fragments so that they miss the earth or are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere
delay exploits the fact that both the earth and the impactor are in orbit
an impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time or more correctly when some point on earths surface intersects the impactors orbit when the impactor arrives
since the earth is approximately km in diameter and moves at approx
km per second in its orbit it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about seconds or slightly over seven minutes
delaying or advancing the impactors arrival by times of this magnitude can depending on the exact geometry of the impact cause it to miss the earth
project icarus was one of the first projects designed in as a contingency plan in case of collision with icarus
the plan relied on the new saturn v rocket which did not make its first flight until after the report had been completed
six saturn v rockets would be used each launched at variable intervals from months to hours away from impact
each rocket was to be fitted with a single megaton nuclear warhead as well as a modified apollo service module and uncrewed apollo command module for guidance to the target
the warheads would be detonated meters from the surface deflecting or partially destroying the asteroid
depending on the subsequent impacts on the course or the destruction of the asteroid later missions would be modified or cancelled as needed
the last ditch launch of the sixth rocket would be hours prior to impact
asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories
asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction as places human beings might colonize resources for extracting minerals hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points and as a threat to life on earth or other inhabited planets dwarf planets and natural satellites by potential impact
an allocution or allocutus is a formal statement made to a court by the defendant who has been found guilty before being sentenced
it is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using common law
an allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient
in plea bargains an allocution may be required of the defendant
the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence
in principle that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendants guilt in the matter
the term allocution is used generally only in jurisdictions in the united states but there are vaguely similar processes in other common law countries
in many other jurisdictions it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on their clients behalf and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak
in australia the term allocutus is used by the clerk of arraigns or another formal associate of the court
it is generally phrased as prisoner at the bar you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the offence of xyz
do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this court should not now be passed upon you the defense counsel will then make a plea in mitigation in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendants previous good character and good works if any
the right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute if a judge or magistrate refuses to hear such a plea or does not properly consider it the sentence can be overturned on appeal
in most of the united states defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed
some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right
in its absence a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing
in the federal system federal rules of criminal procedure provides that the court must address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence
the federal public defender recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in
an is a written statement voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath or affirmation which is administered by a person who is authorized to do so by law
such a statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiants signature by a taker of oaths such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths
an affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing or in other words it contains a verification which means that it is made under oath on penalty of perjury and this serves as evidence for its veracity and is required in court proceedings
an affidavit is typically defined as a written declaration or statement that is sworn or affirmed before a person who has authority to administer an oath
there is no general defined form for an affidavit although for some proceedings an affidavit must satisfy legal or statutory requirements in order to be considered
an affidavit may include in some cases an introductory clause called a preamble is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority
an affidavit may also recite that the statement it records was made under penalty of perjury
an affidavit that is prepared for use within the context of litigation may also include a caption that identifies the venue and parties to the relevant judicial proceedings
on march the high court of australia held that the act uniform evidence legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight
the term affidavit is used in the uk
according the uk government website the affidavit can be sworn or affirmed by a solicitor notary or commissioner for oaths or by an authorised member of court staff
in indian law although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein the courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit
affidavit is not treated as evidence within the meaning of section of the evidence act
however it was held by the supreme court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the court so orders for sufficient reasons namely the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for cross examination
therefore an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the court
in sri lanka under the oaths ordinance with the exception of a court martial a person may submit an affidavit signed in the presence of a commissioner for oaths or a justice of the peace
affidavits are made in a similar way as to england and wales although make oath is sometimes omitted
an affirmed affidavit may be substituted for an sworn affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths
the person making the affidavit is known as the deponent and signs the affidavit
the affidavit concludes in the standard format sworn affirmed before me of commissioner for oaths solicitor a commissioner for oaths on the at and i know the deponent and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths
it is important that the commissioner states his her name clearly sometimes documents are rejected when the name cannot be ascertained
in august a new method of filing affidavits came into force
under section of the civil law and criminal law act witnesses are no longer required to swear before god or make an affirmation when filing an affidavit
instead witnesses will make a non religious statement of truth and if it is breached will be liable for up to one year in prison if convicted summarily or upon conviction on indictment to a maximum fine of or imprisonment for a term not exceeding years or both
this is designed to replace affidavits and statutory declarations in situations where the electronic means of lodgement or filing of documents with the court provided for in section is utilised
as of january it has yet to be adopted widely and it is expected it will not be used for some time by lay litigants who will still lodge papers in person
in american jurisprudence under the rules for hearsay admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar
affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence
an affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witnesss recollection
materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence
if the affiant is a party in the case the affiants opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence as statements by a party opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule
affidavits are typically included in the response to interrogatories
requests for admissions under federal rule of civil procedure however are not required to be sworn
when a person signs an affidavit that person is eligible to take the stand at a trial or evidentiary hearing
one party may wish to summon the affiant to verify the contents of the affidavit while the other party may want to cross examine the affiant about the affidavit
some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion
in such a case a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion as certain assumptions are made to wit the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes judicial economy
the lawyer is an officer of the court and knows that a false swearing by them if found out could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including disbarment
the lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit
affidavits should not be confused with unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury
in federal courts and about states as of unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury are authorized by statute as acceptable in lieu of affidavits
the key differences are that an unsworn declaration does not bear the jurat of a notary public and the declarant is not required to swear an oath or affirmation
rather the signature of the declarant under a carefully worded phrase binding them to the truth of their statements under penalty of perjury is deemed as a matter of law to be sufficiently solemn to remind the declarant of their duty to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
the point of such affidavit substitution statutes is that unsworn declarations can be prepared and executed far more quickly and economically than affidavits in that the witness need not meet personally with a notary public for the notarization process
the acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions
equally the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court is not a given
this matter is addressed by the use of the apostille a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the hague convention abolishing the requirement of legalization for foreign public documents
documents which have been notarized by a notary public and certain other documents and then certified with a conformant apostille are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the hague convention
thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues
aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac
it is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between pisces to the west and taurus to the east
the name aries is latin for ram
its old astronomical symbol is
it is one of the constellations described by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and remains one of the modern constellations
it is a mid sized constellation ranking th in overall size with an area of square degrees
aries has represented a ram since late babylonian times
before that the stars of aries formed a farmhand
different cultures have incorporated the stars of aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in china and a porpoise in the marshall islands
aries is a relatively dim constellation possessing only four bright stars hamal sheratan mesarthim and arietis
the few deep sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies
several meteor showers appear to radiate from aries including the daytime arietids and the epsilon arietids
aries is now recognized as an official constellation albeit as a specific region of the sky by the international astronomical union
it was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars and has remained a constellation since ancient times it now includes the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars
in the description of the babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the mulapin the constellation now known as aries was the final station along the ecliptic
the mulapin was a comprehensive table of the rising and settings of stars which likely served as an agricultural calendar
modern day aries was known as the agrarian worker or the hired man
although likely compiled in the th or th century bc the mulapin reflects a tradition that marks the pleiades as the vernal equinox which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the middle bronze age
the earliest identifiable reference to aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from to bc
on several boundary stones a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters
the shift in identification from the constellation as the agrarian worker to the ram likely occurred in later babylonian tradition because of its growing association with dumuzi the shepherd
by the time the mulapin was created in bc modern aries was identified with both dumuzis ram and a hired labourer
the exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of aries or other ram figures
in ancient egyptian astronomy aries was associated with the god amun ra who was depicted as a man with a rams head and represented fertility and creativity
because it was the location of the vernal equinox it was called the indicator of the reborn sun
during the times of the year when aries was prominent priests would process statues of amon ra to temples a practice that was modified by persian astronomers centuries later
aries acquired the title of lord of the head in egypt referring to its symbolic and mythological importance
aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times
in hellenistic astrology the constellation of aries is associated with the golden ram of greek mythology that rescued phrixus and helle on orders from hermes taking phrixus to the land of colchis
phrixus and helle were the son and daughter of king athamas and his first wife nephele
the kings second wife ino was jealous and wished to kill his children
to accomplish this she induced famine in boeotia then falsified a message from the oracle of delphi that said phrixus must be sacrificed to end the famine
athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop mount laphystium when aries sent by nephele arrived
helle fell off of ariess back in flight and drowned in the dardanelles also called the hellespont in her honour
historically aries has been depicted as a crouched wingless ram with its head turned towards taurus
ptolemy asserted in his almagest that hipparchus depicted alpha arietis as the rams muzzle though ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure
instead it was listed as an unformed star and denoted as the star over the head
john flamsteed in his atlas coelestis followed ptolemys description by mapping it above the figures head
flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting aries lying down
astrologically aries has been associated with the head and its humors
it was strongly associated with mars both the planet and the god
it was considered to govern western europe and syria and to indicate a strong temper in a person
the first point of aries the location of the vernal equinox is named for the constellation
this is because the sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in aries more than two millennia ago
hipparchus defined it in bc
as a point south of gamma arietis
because of the precession of the equinoxes the first point of aries has since moved into pisces and will move into aquarius by around ad
the sun now appears in aries from late april through mid may though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring
medieval muslim astronomers depicted aries in various ways
astronomers like al sufi saw the constellation as a ram modelled on the precedent of ptolemy
however some islamic celestial globes depicted aries as a nondescript four legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns
some early bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky this constellation featured the pleiades as the rams tail
the generally accepted arabic formation of aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five unformed stars four of which were over the animals hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over ariess head
al sufis depiction differed from both other arab astronomers and flamsteeds in that his aries was running and looking behind itself
the obsolete constellations apes vespa lilium and musca borealis all centred on the same four stars now known as and arietis
in petrus plancius introduced apes a constellation representing a bee
in the same stars were used by jakob bartsch for vespa representing a wasp
in augustin royer used these stars for his constellation lilium representing the fleur de lis
none of these constellations became widely accepted
johann hevelius renamed the constellation musca in in his firmamentum sobiescianum
to differentiate it from musca the southern fly it was later renamed musca borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into aries
in the international astronomical union defined its recommended three letter abbreviation ari
the official boundaries of aries were defined in by eugne delporte as a polygon of segments
its right ascension is between h m and h m and its declination is between and in the equatorial coordinate system
in traditional chinese astronomy stars from aries were used in several constellations
the brightest stars alpha beta and gamma arietis formed a constellation called louvariously translated as bond or lasso also sickle which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle
this name was shared by the th lunar mansion the location of the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox
this constellation has also been associated with harvest time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head
and arietis were part of a constellation called wei which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the th lunar mansion which represented granaries
delta and zeta arietis were a part of the constellation tianyin thought to represent the emperors hunting partner
zuogeng a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector was composed of mu nu omicron pi and sigma arietis
he was accompanied by yeou kang a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution
in a similar system to the chinese the first lunar mansion in hindu astronomy was called aswini after the traditional names for beta and gamma arietis the aswins
because the hindu new year began with the vernal equinox the rig veda contains over new years related hymns to the twins making them some of the most prominent characters in the work
aries itself was known as aja and mesha
in hebrew astronomy aries was named taleh it signified either simeon or gad and generally symbolizes the lamb of the world
the neighboring syrians named the constellation amru and the bordering turks named it kuzi
half a world away in the marshall islands several stars from aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a porpoise along with stars from cassiopeia andromeda and triangulum
alpha beta and gamma arietis formed the head of the porpoise while stars from andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of cassiopeia formed the tail
other polynesian peoples recognized aries as a constellation
the marquesas islanders called it na pai ka the mori constellation pipiri may correspond to modern aries as well
in indigenous peruvian astronomy a constellation with most of the same stars as aries existed
it was called the market moon and the kneeling terrace as a reminder of when to hold the annual harvest festival ayri huay
aries has three prominent stars forming an asterism designated alpha beta and gamma arietis by johann bayer
alpha and beta are commonly used for navigation
there is also one other star above the fourth magnitude arietis
arietis called hamal is the brightest star in aries
its traditional name is derived from the arabic word for lamb or head of the ram which references ariess mythological background
with a spectral class of k and a luminosity class of iii it is an orange giant with an apparent visual magnitude of which lies light years from earth
hamal has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is arietis also known as sheratan is a blue white star with an apparent visual magnitude of
its traditional name is derived from sharatayn the arabic word for the two signs referring to both beta and gamma arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox
the two stars were known to the bedouin as qarna al hamal horns of the ram
it is light years from earth
it has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is it is a spectroscopic binary star one in which the companion star is only known through analysis of the spectra
the spectral class of the primary is a
hermann carl vogel determined that sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in its orbit was determined by hans ludendorff in
it has since been studied for its eccentric orbit
arietis with a common name of mesarthim is a binary star with two white hued components located in a rich field of magnitude stars
its traditional name has conflicting derivations
it may be derived from a corruption of al sharatan the arabic word meaning pair or a word for fat ram
however it may also come from the sanskrit for first star of aries or the hebrew for ministerial servants both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names
along with beta arietis it was known to the bedouin as qarna al hamal
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude
the system is light years from earth
the two components are separated by arcseconds and the system as a whole has an apparent magnitude of the primary has a luminosity of and the secondary has a luminosity of the primary is an a type star with an absolute magnitude of and the secondary is a b type star with an absolute magnitude of the angle between the two components is
mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by robert hooke in one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries
the primary arietis is an alpha canum venaticorum variable star that has a range of magnitudes and a period of days
it is unusual because of its strong silicon emission lines
the constellation is home to several double stars including epsilon lambda and pi arietis
arietis is a binary star with two white components
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the system is light years from earth
its overall magnitude is and the primary has an absolute magnitude of its spectral class is a
the two components are separated by arcseconds
arietis is a wide double star with a white hued primary and a yellow hued secondary
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the primary is light years from earth
it has an absolute magnitude of and a spectral class of f
the two components are separated by arcseconds at an angle of the two stars are located east of arietis
arietis is a close binary star with a blue white primary and a white secondary
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the primary is light years from earth
the primary itself is a wide double star with a separation of arcseconds the tertiary has a magnitude of the primary and secondary are separated by arcseconds
most of the other stars in aries visible to the naked eye have magnitudes between and
ari called boten is a star of magnitude light years away
it has an absolute magnitude of and a spectral class of k
arietis is a star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is a and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is f and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a similar star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is k and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a dim star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b and its absolute magnitude is arietis known both as c arietis and nair al butain is a brighter star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b and it has a luminosity of
its absolute magnitude is arietis is a runaway star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b
it was likely ejected from the orion nebula approximately five million years ago possibly due to supernovae
finally teegardens star is the closest star to earth in aries
it is a red dwarf of magnitude and spectral class mv
with a proper motion of arcseconds per year it is the th closest star to earth overall
aries has its share of variable stars including r and u arietis mira type variable stars and t arietis a semi regular variable star
r arietis is a mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
it is light years away
u arietis is another mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
t arietis is a semiregular variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
it is light years away
one particularly interesting variable in aries is sx arietis a rotating variable star considered to be the prototype of its class helium variable stars
sx arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of helium i and silicon iii
they are normally main sequence bp bp stars and their variations are not usually visible to the naked eye
therefore they are observed photometrically usually having periods that fit in the course of one night
similar to s sx arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field which correspond to the periodic rotation they differ from the canum venaticorum variables in their higher temperature
there are between and sx arietis variable stars currently known ten are noted as being uncertain in the general catalog of variable stars
ngc is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of located southeast of arietis and arcminutes west of arietis
it is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope
it is by arcminutes meaning that its surface brightness magnitude is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude
ngc is a class sab galaxy which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly
the main arm on the northwest side of the galaxy is home to many star forming regions this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies
ngc has a small companion galaxy ngc that is about light years away from the larger galaxy
the two galaxies together are also classified as arp in the arp peculiar galaxy catalog
ngc has a diameter of light years and the system is million light years from earth
another spiral galaxy in aries is ngc a face on class sabc galaxy
it is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms
it has no ring and a faint bulge and is by arcminutes
it has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core
light years in diameter ngc is million light years from earth
ngc and ngc are a pair of galaxies in aries that are only about light years apart
part of the ngc group of galaxies both are at a distance of approximately million light years
ngc is an edge on spiral galaxy that is by arcminutes
ngc an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary is the brighter of the two at magnitude ngc has a magnitude of
both galaxies have bright cores but ngc is the larger galaxy at a diameter of light years ngc has a diameter of light years
ngc is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane
ngc itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight
it has multiple spiral arms and a bright core
because it is so diffuse it has a low surface brightness
it has a diameter of light years and is million light years away
ngc is the brightest member of an galaxy group that also includes ngc ngc and ngc with a magnitude of
it is by arcminutes and is million light years away with a diameter of light years
its companion is ngc which is about light years from the core of ngc
they are interacting gravitationally as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust
arp is a different pair of interacting galaxies in aries consisting of ngc and ic
ngc is an e elliptical galaxy
it is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies
ngc is by arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of its diameter is light years and it is million light years away
another unusual galaxy in aries is segue a dwarf and satellite galaxy of the milky way recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization
aries is home to several meteor showers
the daytime arietid meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day lasting from may to july
it is an annual shower associated with the marsden group of comets that peaks on june with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of meteors
its parent body may be the asteroid icarus
the meteors are sometimes visible before dawn because the radiant is degrees away from the sun
they usually appear at a rate of per hour as earthgrazers meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon
because most of the daytime arietids are not visible to the naked eye they are observed in the radio spectrum
this is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake
other meteor showers radiate from aries during the day these include the daytime epsilon arietids and the northern and southern daytime may arietids
the jodrell bank observatory discovered the daytime arietids in when james hey and g
stewart adapted the world war ii era radar systems for meteor observations
the delta arietids are another meteor shower radiating from aries
peaking on december with a low peak rate the shower lasts from december to january with the highest rates visible from to december
the average delta arietid meteor is very slow with an average velocity of per second
however this shower sometimes produces bright fireballs
this meteor shower has northern and southern components both of which are likely associated with ha a near earth asteroid
the autumn arietids also radiate from aries
the shower lasts from september to october and peaks on october
its peak rate is low
the epsilon arietids appear from to october
other meteor showers radiating from aries include the october delta arietids daytime epsilon arietids daytime may arietids sigma arietids nu arietids and beta arietids
the sigma arietids a class iv meteor shower are visible from to october with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on october
aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets
hip a g type star is orbited by three giant planets
hd like hip is a g type main sequence star slightly larger than the sun with two orbiting planets
one planet is times the mass of jupiter and the other is times the mass of jupiter
hd is a g type star approximately the size of the sun with one orbiting planet
the planet discovered in has a mass times that of jupiter and orbits every days
in scientists conducting the carmenes survey at the calar alto observatory announced evidence of two earth mass exoplanets orbiting teegardens star located in aries within its habitable zone
the star is a small red dwarf with only around a tenth of the mass and radius of the sun
it has a large radial velocity
simbad aquarius is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac between capricornus and pisces
its name is latin for water carrier or cup carrier and its old astronomical symbol is a representation of water
aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac
it was one of the constellations listed by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and it remains one of the modern constellations
it is found in a region often called the sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as cetus the whale pisces the fish and eridanus the river
at apparent magnitude beta aquarii is the brightest star in the constellation
aquarius is identified as the great one in the babylonian star catalogues and represents the god ea himself who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase
the babylonian star figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium
it contained the winter solstice in the early bronze age
in old babylonian astronomy ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the suns path the way of ea corresponding to the period of days on either side of winter solstice
aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the babylonians regularly experienced and thus was negatively connoted
in ancient egypt astronomy aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the nile the banks were said to flood when aquarius put his jar into the river beginning spring
in the greek tradition the constellation came to be represented simply as a single vase from which a stream poured down to piscis austrinus
the name in the hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha water pitcher
in greek mythology aquarius is sometimes associated with deucalion the son of prometheus who built a ship with his wife pyrrha to survive an imminent flood
they sailed for nine days before washing ashore on mount parnassus
aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful ganymede a youth in greek mythology and the son of trojan king tros who was taken to mount olympus by zeus to act as cup carrier to the gods
neighboring aquila represents the eagle under zeus command that snatched the young boy some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact zeus transformed
one tradition stated that he was carried off by eos
yet another figure associated with the water bearer is cecrops i a king of athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods
in the first century ptolemys almagest established the common western depiction of aquarius
his water jar an asterism itself consists of gamma pi eta and zeta aquarii it pours water in a stream of more than stars terminating with fomalhaut now assigned solely to piscis austrinus
the water bearers head is represented by th magnitude aquarii while his left shoulder is beta aquarii his right shoulder and forearm are represented by alpha and gamma aquarii respectively
in chinese astronomy the stream of water flowing from the water jar was depicted as the army of yu lin
the name yu lin means feathers and forests referring to the numerous light footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars
the constellations stars were the most numerous of any chinese constellation numbering the majority of which were located in modern aquarius
the celestial army was protected by the wall leibizhen which counted iota lambda phi and sigma aquarii among its stars
and aquarii represent fou youe the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions
also in aquarius is loui pi tchin the ramparts that stretch from and piscium and and aquarii through phi lambda sigma and iota aquarii to delta gamma kappa and epsilon capricorni
near the border with cetus the axe fuyue was represented by three stars its position is disputed and may have instead been located in sculptor
tienliecheng also has a disputed position the star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed nu and xi aquarii but may instead have been located south in piscis austrinus
the water jar asterism was seen to the ancient chinese as the tomb fenmu
nearby the emperors mausoleum xiuliang stood demarcated by kappa aquarii and three other collinear stars
ku and qi each composed of two stars were located in the same region
three of the chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations
nu also the name for the th lunar mansion was a handmaiden represented by epsilon mu and aquarii
the th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation xu formed by beta aquarii and alpha equulei it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals
wei the rooftop and th lunar mansion was a v shaped constellation formed by alpha aquarii theta pegasi and epsilon pegasi it shared its name with two other chinese constellations in modern day scorpius and aries
despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size aquarius has no particularly bright stars its four brightest stars being less than however recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems
the two brightest stars aquarii and aquarii are luminous yellow supergiants of spectral types gib and gib respectively that were once hot blue white b class main sequence stars to times as massive as the sun
the two are also moving through space perpendicular to the plane of the milky way
just shading aquarii is the brightest star in aquarius with apparent it also has the proper name of sadalsuud
having cooled and swollen to around times the suns diameter it is around times as luminous as the sun
it is around times as massive as the sun and around million years old
sadalsuud is from earth
aquarii also known as sadalmelik has apparent it is distant from earth and is around times as massive as the sun and times as luminous
it is million years old
aquarii also called sadachbia is a white main sequence star of spectral type star of spectral type av that is between and million years old and is around times the suns mass and double its radius
its magnitude is and it is away hence its luminosity is
the name sadachbia comes from the arabic for lucky stars of the tents sad al akhbiya
aquarii also known as skat or scheat is a blue white spectral type a star with apparent magnitude and luminosity
aquarii also known as albali is a blue white spectral type a star with apparent magnitude absolute magnitude and a luminosity of
aquarii is a spectral type f double star both stars are white
in combination they appear to be magnitude with luminosity
the primary has magnitude and the secondarys magnitude is but both have absolute the systems orbital period is years currently the two components are moving farther apart
aquarii sometimes called ancha is spectral type g with apparent magnitude and an absolute aquarii also called situla has an apparent aquarii also called hudoor or ekchusis is spectral type m with magnitude and luminosity
aquarii also called bunda is spectral type a with an apparent magnitude and an absolute aquarii also called seat is spectral type b with apparent magnitude and absolute twelve exoplanet systems have been found in aquarius as of
gliese one of the nearest stars to earth at a distance of light years was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system
it is orbited by four planets including one terrestrial planet times the mass of earth
the planets vary in orbital period from days to days
aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet aquarii b
the planets mass is times the mass of jupiter and its orbital period is days
gliese is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long period jupiter like planet gliese b
the planets mass is times that of jupiter and its orbital period is days
there are also less prominent systems in aquarius
wasp a type g star of magnitude is host to one exoplanet wasp b
the star is parsecs from earth and has a mass of solar masses and a radius of solar radii
wasp b was discovered in by the transit method
it orbits its parent star every days at a distance of astronomical units
it is jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of jupiter radii
hd a k star located parsecs from earth is host to one planet hd b
the host star is larger than the sun more massive at solar masses and larger at solar radii
the planet was discovered by the radial velocity method in and has a mass of jupiter masses
it orbits every days at a distance of au
much closer to its sun is wasp b which orbits every days only au from its sun yellow dwarf wasp
wasp is close in size to the sun having a radius of solar radii and a mass even closer at solar masses
wasp b was discovered in by the transit method like wasp b
it is slightly larger than jupiter with a mass of jupiter masses and a radius of jupiter masses
there are several more single planet systems in aquarius
hd a magnitude yellow star located parsecs from earth is host to one known planet hd b
the jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as earth orbits the sun au though its orbital period is significantly longer at around days
hd b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in aquarius detected by the radial velocity method in
the star it orbits resembles the sun beyond their similar spectral class it has a radius of solar radii and a mass of solar masses
hd b a larger planet at jupiter masses orbits host star hd at a distance of au
the star itself barely below the threshold of naked eye visibility at magnitude is a giv star located parsecs from earth
though it has a similar mass to the sun solar massesit is significantly less dense with its radius of solar radii
its lone planet was discovered in by the radial velocity method like several other exoplanets in the constellation
as of there were only two known multiple planet systems within the bounds of aquarius the gliese and hd systems
the former is quite prominent the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at parsecs
the hd system consists of the planets hd b and hd c orbiting their k type magnitude sun
both discovered in by the radial velocity method the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star
hd c is the larger at jupiter masses its smaller sibling is barely smaller at jupiter masses
the error in the mass measurements is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant
hd c also orbits further from the star than hd b au compared to
on february nasa announced that ultracool dwarf star trappist in aquarius has seven earth like rocky planets
of these as many as four may lie within the systems habitable zone and may have liquid water on their surfaces
the discovery of the trappist system is seen by astronomers as a significant step toward finding life beyond earth
because of its position away from the galactic plane the majority of deep sky objects in aquarius are galaxies globular clusters and planetary nebulae
aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the messier catalog the globular clusters messier messier and the asterism messier
while m was originally catalogued as a sparsely populated open cluster modern analysis indicates the main stars are not close enough together to fit this definition reclassifying m as an asterism
two well known planetary nebulae are also located in aquarius the saturn nebula to the southeast of aquarii and the famous helix nebula southwest of aquarii
m also catalogued as ngc is a rich globular cluster located approximately light years from earth
at magnitude it is viewable in small aperture instruments but a mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars
m also catalogued as ngc is a small th magnitude globular cluster located approximately light years from earth
m also catalogued as ngc is an open cluster with highly disputed status
aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae
ngc also known as the saturn nebula is an th magnitude planetary nebula located light years from earth
it was given its moniker by the th century astronomer lord rosse for its resemblance to the planet saturn in a telescope it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble saturns rings
it appears blue green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude compared to the helix nebula another planetary nebula in aquarius it is quite small
ngc also known as the helix nebula is the closest planetary nebula to earth at a distance of light years
it covers square degrees making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from earth
however because it is so large it is only viewable as a very faint object though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of one of the visible galaxies in aquarius is ngc of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae
a spiral galaxy it has an integrated magnitude of and is by arcseconds
ngc is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the atoms for peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom
there are three major meteor showers with radiants in aquarius the eta aquariids the delta aquariids and the iota aquariids
the eta aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from aquarius
it peaks between and may with a rate of approximately meteors per hour
originally discovered by chinese astronomers in eta aquariids can be seen coming from the water jar beginning on april and as late as may
the parent body of the shower is halleys comet a periodic comet
fireballs are common shortly after the peak approximately between may and may
the normal meteors appear to have yellow trails
the delta aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on july and second on august
the first radiant is located in the south of the constellation while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of pisces asterism
the southern radiants peak rate is about meteors per hour while the northern radiants peak rate is about meteors per hour
the iota aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on august with a rate of approximately meteors per hour
the sun appears in the constellation aquarius from february to march
in tropical astrology the sun is considered to be in the sign aquarius from january to february and in sidereal astrology from february to march
aquarius is also associated with the age of aquarius a concept popular in s counterculture and medieval alchemy
the date of the start of the age of aquarius is a topic of much debate
the earliest commercial japanese animation dates to
a characteristic art style emerged in the s with the works of cartoonist osamu tezuka and spread in following decades developing a large domestic audience
anime is distributed theatrically through television broadcasts directly to home media and over the internet
in addition to original works anime are often adaptations of japanese comics light novels or video games
it is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences
anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies
it combines graphic art characterization cinematography and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques
compared to western animation anime production generally focuses less on movement and more on the detail of settings and use of camera effects such as panning zooming and angle shots
diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes
the anime industry consists of over production companies including major studios such as studio ghibli kyoto animation sunrise bones ufotable mappa wit studio comix wave films production ig and toei animation
since the s the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed subtitled programming and since the s due to the rise of streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture both within japan and worldwide
japanese animation accounted for of the worlds animated television shows
as a type of animation anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself
in japanese the term anime is used to refer to all animated works regardless of style or origin
english language dictionaries typically define anime as a style of japanese animation or as a style of animation originating in japan
other definitions are based on origin making production in japan a requisite for a work to be considered anime
the etymology of the term anime is disputed
the english word animation is written in japanese katakana as and as in its shortened form
some sources claim that the term is derived from the french term for animation but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in france in the late s and s
in english anime when used as a common noun normally functions as a mass noun
as with a few other japanese words such as sak and pokmon english texts sometimes spell anime as anim with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader to pronounce the letter not to leave it silent as english orthography may suggest
prior to the widespread use of anime the term japanimation a portmanteau of japan and animation was prevalent throughout the s and s
in the mid s the term anime began to supplant japanimation in general the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify japanese animation
animation in japan began in the early th century when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in france germany the united states and russia
a claim for the earliest japanese animation is katsud shashin a private work by an unknown creator
in the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear animators such as ten shimokawa seitar kitayama and junichi kuchi produced numerous films the oldest surviving of which is kuchis namakura gatana
many early works were lost with the destruction of shimokawas warehouse in the great kant earthquake
by the mid s animation was well established in japan as an alternative format to the live action industry
it suffered competition from foreign producers such as disney and many animators including nobur fuji and yasuji murata continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation
other creators including kenz masaoka and mitsuyo seo nevertheless made great strides in technique benefiting from the patronage of the government which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda
in the government dissolved several artists organizations to form the the first talkie anime was chikara to onna no yo no naka a short film produced by masaoka
the first feature length anime film was produced by seo with a sponsorship from the imperial japanese navy
the s saw a proliferation of short animated advertisements created for television
in the s manga artist and animator osamu tezuka adapted and simplified disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions
originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced staff many of his limited animation practices came to define the mediums style
three tales was the first anime film broadcast on television the first anime television series was instant history
an early and influential success was astro boy a television series directed by tezuka based on his manga of the same name
many animators at tezukas mushi production later established major anime studios
the s saw growth in the popularity of manga many of which were later animated
tezukas work and that of other pioneers in the field inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today
the giant robot genre for instance took shape under tezuka developed into the super robot genre under go nagai and others and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by yoshiyuki tomino who developed the real robot genre
robot anime series such as gundam and super dimension fortress macross became instant classics in the s and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades
the bubble economy of the s spurred a new era of high budget and experimental anime films including nausica of the valley of the wind and akira
neon genesis evangelion a television series produced by gainax and directed by hideaki anno began another era of experimental anime titles such as ghost in the shell and cowboy bebop
in the s anime also began attracting greater interest in western countries major international successes include sailor moon and dragon ball z both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide
in spirited away a studio ghibli feature film directed by hayao miyazaki won the academy award for best animated feature at the th academy awards
it later became the highest grossing anime film earning more than million
since the s an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels successful examples include the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and fate stay night
became the highest grossing japanese film and one of the worlds highest grossing films of
it also became the fastest grossing film in japanese cinema because in days it made billion yen
it beat the previous record of spirited away which took days
in the anime adaptations of jujutsu kaisen and tokyo revengers were among the top most discussed tv shows worldwide on twitter
in attack on titan won the award of most in demand tv series in the world in the global tv demand awards
attack on titan became the first ever non english language series to earn the title of worlds most in demand tv show previously held by only the walking dead and game of thrones
in jujutsu kaisen broke the guinness world record for the most in demand animated tv show with a global demand rating times than that of the average tv show previously held by attack on titan
anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles methods of animation its production and its process
visually anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles differing between creators artists and studios
while no single art style predominates anime as a whole they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design
anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation flat expression the suspension of time its thematic range the presence of historical figures its complex narrative line and above all a peculiar drawing style with characters characterized by large and oval eyes with very defined lines bright colors and reduced movement of the lips
modern anime follows a typical animation production process involving storyboarding voice acting character design and cel production
since the s animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process
early anime works were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards stop motion animation of paper cutouts and silhouette animation
cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium
in the st century the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by tadahito mochinaga kihachir kawamoto and tomoyasu murata
computers were integrated into the animation process in the s with works such as ghost in the shell and princess mononoke mixing cel animation with computer generated images
fuji film a major cel production company announced it would stop cel production producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes
prior to the digital era anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach
the majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in between animation
japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques and have given anime a distinct set of conventions
unlike disney animation where the emphasis is on the movement anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement
such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices
anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three dimensional views and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work
the backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations as exemplified in howls moving castle and the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all star cast usually comes out looking tremendously impressive
the cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in american animation
anime is cinematically shot as if by camera including panning zooming distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality
in anime the animation is produced before the voice acting contrary to american animation which does the voice acting first
the body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality
the height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion
head to height ratios vary drastically by art style with most anime characters falling between and heads tall
anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall
some anime works like crayon shin chan completely disregard these proportions in such a way that they resemble caricatured western cartoons
a common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size
the animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to osamu tezuka who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as betty boop who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes
tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes
the artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth
generally a mixture of a light shade the tone color and a dark shade is used
however not all anime characters have large eyes
for example the works of hayao miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes as well as realistic hair colors on their characters
hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled
the movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and hair actions is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect
poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga where eye catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for childrens manga
some anime will depict non japanese characters with specific ethnic features such as a pronounced nose and jutting jaw for european characters
in other cases anime feature characters whose race or nationality is not always defined and this is often a deliberate decision such as in the pokmon animated series
anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts
these techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in western animation and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods
for example a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused
a variety of visual symbols are employed including sweat drops to depict nervousness visible blushing for embarrassment or glowing eyes for an intense glare
another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment
the opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by j pop or j rock songs often by reputed bands as written with the series in mind but are also aimed at the general music market therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all to the thematic settings or plot of the series
also they are often used as incidental music in an episode in order to highlight particularly important scenes
future funk a musical microgenre that evolved in the early s from vaporwave with a french house euro disco influence heavily uses anime visuals and samples along with japanese city pop to build an aesthetic
since the s anime songs have experienced a rapid growth in global online popularity due to their widened availability on music streaming services like spotify and promotion by fans and artists on social media
in the opening theme idol by yoasobi of the anime series oshi no ko topped the billboard global excl
us charts with million streams and copies sold outside the us idol has become the first japanese song and anime song to top the billboard global chart as well as taking the first spot on the apple musics top global chart
anime are often classified by target demographic including and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience
shjo and shnen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of all genders in an attempt to gain crossover appeal
adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing as well as adult themes and situations
a subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled r in japan and are internationally known as hentai
by contrast some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse as typified in the comedic or harem genres due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service
some genres explore homosexual romances such as yaoi and yuri
while often used in a pornographic context the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves
animes genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification
gilles poitras compared the labeling of gundam and its complex depiction of war as a giant robot anime akin to simply labeling war and peace a war novel
science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like tezukas astro boy and yokoyamas tetsujin go
a major subgenre of science fiction is mecha with the gundam metaseries being iconic
the diverse fantasy genre includes works based on asian and western traditions and folklore examples include the japanese feudal fairytale inuyasha and the depiction of scandinavian goddesses who move to japan to maintain a computer called yggdrasil in ah my goddess
genre crossing in anime is also prevalent such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in dragon half and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film castle of cagliostro
other subgenres found in anime include magical girl harem sports martial arts literary adaptations medievalism and war
early anime works were made for theatrical viewing and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production
in nippon television aired mogura no abanchru both the first televised and first color anime to debut
it was not until the s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since
works released in a direct to video format are called original video animation or original animation video and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release
the emergence of the internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called original net animation
the home distribution of anime releases was popularized in the s with the vhs and laserdisc formats
the vhs ntsc video format used in both japan and the united states is credited with aiding the rising popularity of anime in the s
the laserdisc and vhs formats were transcended by the dvd format which offered the unique advantages including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc
the dvd format also has its drawbacks in its usage of region coding adopted by the industry to solve licensing piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the dvd player
the video cd format was popular in hong kong and taiwan but became only a minor format in the united states that was closely associated with bootleg copies
a key characteristic of many anime television shows is serialization where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons
traditional american television had an episodic format with each episode typically consisting of a self contained story
in contrast anime shows such as dragon ball z had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons which distinguished them from traditional american television shows serialization has since also become a common characteristic of american streaming television shows during the peak tv era
the animation industry consists of more than production companies with some of the major studios including toei animation gainax madhouse gonzo sunrise bones tms entertainment nippon animation paworks studio pierrot production ig ufotable and studio ghibli
many of the studios are organized into a trade association the association of japanese animations
there is also a labor union for workers in the industry the japanese animation creators association
studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects as done with studio ghiblis spirited away
an anime episode can cost between us and us to produce
in animation accounted for of the japanese film market above the market share for live action works
the popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the dvd market contributing nearly of total sales
according to a article on nikkei asian review japanese television stations have bought over worth of anime from production companies over the past few years compared with under from overseas
there has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in japan caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic
this type of anime is less popular outside japan being considered more of a niche product
spirited away was the all time highest grossing film in japan until overtaken by in
it was also the highest grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by makoto shinkais film your name
anime films represent a large part of the highest grossing japanese films yearly in japan with out of the top in and also in
anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released
while anime has been licensed by its japanese owners for use outside japan since at least the s the practice became well established in the united states in the late s to early s when such tv series as gatchaman and captain harlock were licensed from their japanese parent companies for distribution in the us market
the trend towards american distribution of anime continued into the s with the licensing of titles such as voltron and the creation of new series such as robotech through the use of source material from several original series
in the early s several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less child oriented material
some such as ad vision and central park media and its imprints achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative american anime market
others such as animeigo achieved limited success
many companies created directly by japanese parent companies did not do as well most releasing only one or two titles before completing their american operations
licenses are expensive often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie
the prices vary widely for example cost only to license while kurau phantom memory cost
simulcast internet streaming rights can be cheaper with prices around an episode but can also be more expensive with some series costing more than per episode
the anime market for the united states was worth approximately billion in
dubbed animation began airing in the united states in on networks like the wb and cartoon networks adult swim
in this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on cartoon network
as a part of localization some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non japanese culture
the cost of english localization averages us per episode
the industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films
fansubs which were originally distributed on vhs bootlegged cassettes in the s have been freely available and disseminated online since the s
since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed
they also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in english although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks
even so the laid back regulations of the japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing its popularity until there is a demand for official high quality releases for animation companies
this has led to an increase in global popularity of japanese animation reaching million in sales in
fansub practices have rapidly declined since the early s due to the advent of legal streaming services which simulcast new anime series often within a few hours of their domestic release
since the s anime has become a global multibillion industry setting a sales record in of trillion driven largely by demand from overseas audiences
in japans anime industry was valued at billion a year with of that revenue coming from overseas

there were also the american anime awards which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry and were held only once in
anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime like the academy award for best animated feature or the golden bear
in recent years the anime industry has been accused by both japanese and foreign media of underpaying and overworking its animators
in response the japanese prime minister fumio kishida promised to improve the working conditions and salary of all animators and creators working in the industry
a few anime studios such as mappa have taken actions to improve the working conditions of their employees
there has also been a slight increase in production costs and animator pays during the covid pandemic

early american adaptions in the s made japan expand into the continental european market first with productions aimed at european and japanese children such as heidi vicky the viking and barbapapa which aired in various countries
italy spain and france grew a particular interest in japans output due to its cheap selling price and productive output
as of italy imported the most anime outside japan
anime and manga were introduced to france in the late s and became massively popular in spite of a moral panic led by french politicians in the s and s
these mass imports influenced anime popularity in south american arabic and german markets
the beginning of saw the introduction of japanese anime series into the american culture
in the s japanese animation slowly gained popularity in america
media companies such as viz and mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the american market
the film akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the western world during the early s before anime was further popularized by television shows such as pokmon and dragon ball z in the late s
by japanese anime was the fastest growing genre in the american video industry
the growth of the internet later provided international audiences with an easy way to access japanese content
early on online piracy played a major role in this through over time many legal alternatives appeared
since the s streaming services have become increasingly involved in the production licensing and distribution of anime for the international markets
this is especially the case with net services such as netflix and crunchyroll which have large catalogs in western countries although as of anime fans in many developing non western countries such as india and the philippines had fewer options for obtaining access to legal content and therefore would still turn to online piracy
however beginning with the s anime has been experiencing yet another boom in global popularity and demand due to the covid pandemic and streaming services like netflix amazon prime video hbo max disney hulu and anime only services like crunchyroll and hidive increasing the international availability of the amount of new licensed anime shows as well as the size of their catalogs

the word anime alongside other japanese pop cultural terms like shonenshojo and isekai have been added to the oxford english dictionary
various anime and manga series have influenced hollywood in the making of numerous famous movies and characters
hollywood itself has produced live action adaptations of various anime series such as ghost in the shell death note dragon ball evolution and cowboy bebop
however most of these adaptations have been reviewed negatively by both the critics and the audience and have become box office flops
the main reasons for the unsuccessfulness of hollywoods adaptions of anime being the often change of plot and characters from the original source material and the limited capabilities a live action movie or series can do in comparison to an animated counterpart
one of the few particular exceptions to this includes which has become a moderate commercial success receiving generally positive reviews from both the critics and the audience for its visual effects and following the source material
the movie grossed million worldwide making it director robert rodriguezs highest grossing film
anime and manga alongside many other parts of japanese pop culture have helped japan to gain a positive worldwide image and improve its relations with other countries such as its east asian neighbours china and south korea

the federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming years
a survey conducted in countries and territories using a sample consisting of respondents held by dentsu revealed that of all surveyed people found excellency in anime and manga more than other japanese cultural or technological aspects which makes this mass japanese media the rd most liked japanese thing below japanese cuisine and japanese robotics
the advertisement company views anime as a profitable tool for marketing campaigns in foreign countries due to its popularity and high reception
anime plays a role in driving tourism to japan
in surveys held by statista between and of tourists from the united states of tourists from china and of tourists from south korea said they were motivated to visit japan because of japanese popular culture
in a survey held by crunchyroll market research of gen zs and of the general population said that they are familiar with anime
anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the s with the anime boom a period marked by animes increased global popularity
these conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels
cosplay a portmanteau of costume play is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions
japanese culture and words have entered english usage through the popularity of the medium including otaku an unflattering japanese term commonly used in english to denote an obsessive fan of anime and or manga
another word that has arisen describing obsessive fans in the united states is wapanese meaning white individuals who want to be japanese or later known as weeaboo or weeb individuals who demonstrate an obsession with japanese anime subculture a term that originated from abusive content posted on the website chanorg
while originally derogatory the terms otaku and weeb have been reappropriated by the anime fandom overtime and today are used by some fans to refer to themselves in a comedic and more positive way
anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art including computer wallpapers and anime music videos
many fans will visit sites depicted in anime games manga and other forms of otaku culture this behavior is known as anime pilgrimage
as of the s many anime fans and followers use social media platforms and other sites like youtube twitch fandom facebook reddit discord tumblr chan tiktok and twitter with online communities and databases such as imdb myanimelist to discuss anime manga and track their progress watching respective series as well as using news outlets such as anime news network
according to crunchyrolls research data from to provided by its president rahul parini revealed that there are approximately million people globally whom are either highly aware of anime show interest in anime or currently watch anime and identify as fans
due to animes increased popularity in recent years a large number of celebrities such as elon musk bts and ariana grande have come out as anime fans
one of the key points that differentiated anime from a handful of western cartoons is the potential for visceral content
once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation are just for children is put aside the audience can realize that themes involving violence suffering sexuality pain and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime just as much as other media
however as anime itself became increasingly popular its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions
south parks chinpokomon and good times with weapons episodes adult swims perfect hair forever and nickelodeons kappa mikey are examples of western satirical depictions of japanese culture and anime but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime such as konosuba
traditionally only japanese works have been considered anime but some works have sparked debate about blurring the lines between anime and cartoons such as the american anime style productions and
these anime styled works have become defined as anime influenced animation in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non japanese origin
some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration for example the french production team for ban star racers that moved to tokyo to collaborate with a japanese production team
when anime is defined as a style rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries but this has been contentious amongst fans with john oppliger stating the insistence on referring to original american art as japanese anime or manga robs the work of its cultural identity
while some anime will depict non japanese characters with specific ethnic features such as a pronounced nose and jutting jaw for european characters there are some styles that deliberately forgo any identification of its characters with real world ethnicities or nationalities termed in criticism as mukokuseki
mukokuseki characters may be depicted with culturally neutral features and can significantly impact the reception of a property outside of japan
a language awareness study of anime and other forms of japanese popular media found traits such as blonde hair and marked speech were widely used as shorthand for depicting foreign characters described as a quintessential image of foreigners with americans being the most affected nationality
a uae filipino produced tv series called torkaizer is dubbed as the middle easts first anime show and is currently in production and looking for funding
netflix has produced multiple anime series in collaboration with japanese animation studios and in doing so has offered a more accessible channel for distribution to western markets
similar initiatives have been enacted by the us based streaming service crunchyroll producing titles such as high guardian spice and an adaptation of tower of god
the web based series rwby produced by texas based company rooster teeth is produced using an anime art style and the series has been described as anime by multiple sources
for example adweek in the headline to one of its articles described the series as american made anime and in another headline the huffington post described it as simply anime without referencing its country of origin
in monty oum the creator of rwby said some believe just like scotch needs to be made in scotland an american company cant make anime
i think thats a narrow way of seeing it
anime is an art form and to say only one country can make this art is wrong
rwby has been released in japan with a japanese language dub the ceo of rooster teeth matt hullum commented this is the first time any american made anime has been marketed to japan
it definitely usually works the other way around and were really pleased about that
in japanese culture and entertainment media mix is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations different broadcast media gaming technologies cell phones toys amusement parks and other methods
it is the japanese term for a transmedia franchise
the term gained its circulation in late s but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the s with the proliferation of anime with its interconnection of media and commodity goods
a number of anime and manga media franchises such as dragon ball and gundam have gained considerable global popularity and are among the worlds highest grossing media franchises
pokmon in particular is estimated to be the highest grossing media franchise of all time
ankara historically known as ancyra and angora is the capital of turkey
located in the central part of anatolia the city has a population of million in its urban center and million in ankara province making it trkiyes second largest city after istanbul but first by the urban area
serving as the capital of the ancient celtic state of galatia and later of the roman province with the same name the city is very old with various hattian hittite lydian phrygian galatian greek persian roman byzantine and ottoman archeological sites
the ottomans made the city the capital first of the anatolia eyalet and then the angora eyalet and the angora vilayet
the historical center of ankara is a rocky hill rising over the left bank of the ankara river a tributary of the sakarya river
the hill remains crowned by the ruins of ankara castle
although few of its outworks have survived there are well preserved examples of roman and ottoman architecture throughout the city the most remarkable being the bc temple of augustus and rome that boasts the monumentum ancyranum the inscription recording the
on april the grand national assembly of trkiye was established in ankara which became the headquarters of the turkish national movement during the turkish war of independence
ankara became the new turkish capital upon the establishment of the republic on october succeeding in this role as the former turkish capital istanbul following the fall of the ottoman empire
the government is a prominent employer but ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city located at the center of trkiyes road and railway networks
the city gave its name to the angora wool shorn from angora rabbits the long haired angora goat and the angora cat
the area is also known for its pears honey and muscat grapes
although situated in one of the driest regions of trkiye and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant at per head
the orthography of the name ankara has varied over the ages
it has been identified with the hittite cult center although this remains a matter of debate
in classical antiquity and during the medieval period the city was known as in greek and in latin the galatian celtic name was probably a similar variant
following its annexation by the seljuk turks in the city became known in many european languages as angora it was also known in ottoman turkish as
the form angora is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals and in the names of several locations in the us
the regions history can be traced back to the bronze age hattic civilization which was succeeded in the nd millennium bc by the hittites in the th century bc by the phrygians and later by the lydians persians greeks galatians romans byzantines and turks
the oldest settlements in and around the city center of ankara belonged to the hattic civilization which existed during the bronze age and was gradually absorbed c
bc by the indo european hittites
the city grew significantly in size and importance under the phrygians starting around bc and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from gordion after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time
in phrygian tradition king midas was venerated as the founder of ancyra but pausanias mentions that the city was actually far older which accords with present archeological knowledge
phrygian rule was succeeded first by lydian and later by persian rule though the strongly phrygian character of the peasantry remained as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later roman period
persian sovereignty lasted until the persians defeat at the hands of alexander the great who conquered the city in bc
alexander came from gordion to ankara and stayed in the city for a short period
after his death at babylon in bc and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals ankara and its environs fell into the share of antigonus
another important expansion took place under the greeks of pontos who came there around bc and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the black sea ports and crimea to the north assyria cyprus and lebanon to the south and georgia armenia and persia to the east
by that time the city also took its name which in slightly modified form provides the modern name of ankara
in bc the city along with the rest of central anatolia was occupied by a celtic group the galatians who were the first to make ankara one of their main tribal centers the headquarters of the tectosages tribe
other centers were pessinus todays ballhisar for the trocmi tribe and tavium to the east of ankara for the tolistobogii tribe
the city was then known as ancyra
the celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers a warrior aristocracy which ruled over phrygian speaking peasants
however the celtic language continued to be spoken in galatia for many centuries
at the end of the th century st
jerome a native of dalmatia observed that the language spoken around ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the roman world near trier
the city was subsequently passed under the control of the roman empire
in bc emperor augustus raised it to the status of a polis and made it the capital city of the roman province of galatia
ankara is famous for the monumentum ancyranum which contains the official record of the acts of augustus known as the res gestae divi augusti an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple
the ruins of ancyra still furnish today valuable bas reliefs inscriptions and other architectural fragments
two other galatian tribal centers tavium near yozgat and pessinus to the west near sivrihisar continued to be reasonably important settlements in the roman period but it was ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis
an estimated people lived in ancyra in good times during the roman empire a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the roman empire until the early th century
the small ankara river ran through the center of the roman town
it has now been covered and diverted but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the roman byzantine and ottoman periods
ankaya the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center stood well outside the roman city but may have been a summer resort
in the th century the remains of at least one roman villa or large house were still standing not far from where the ankaya presidential residence stands today
to the west the roman city extended until the area of the genlik park and railway station while on the southern side of the hill it may have extended downward as far as the site presently occupied by hacettepe university
it was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the roman towns of gaul or britannia
ancyras importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern anatolia running north south and east west intersected giving it major strategic importance for romes eastern frontier
the great imperial road running east passed through ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way
they were not the only ones to use the roman highway network which was equally convenient for invaders
in the second half of the rd century ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the goths coming from the west and later by the arabs
for about a decade the town was one of the western outposts of one of palmyrean empress zenobia in the syrian desert who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the roman empire to set up a short lived state of her own
the town was reincorporated into the roman empire under emperor aurelian in
the tetrarchy a system of multiple emperors introduced by diocletian seems to have engaged in a substantial program of rebuilding and of road construction from ancyra westwards to germe and dorylaeum
in its heyday roman ancyra was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital where a high official ruled from the citys praetorium a large administrative palace or office
during the rd century life in ancyra as in other anatolian towns seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town
the city is well known during the th century as a center of christian activity due to frequent imperial visits and through the letters of the pagan scholar libanius
bishop marcellus of ancyra and basil of ancyra were active in the theological controversies of their day and the city was the site of no fewer than three church synods in and the latter two in favor of arianism
the city was visited by emperor constans i in and julian during his persian campaign in and julians successor jovian in winter
after jovians death soon after valentinian i was acclaimed emperor at ancyra and in the next year his brother valens used ancyra as his base against the usurper procopius
when the province of galatia was divided sometime in ancyra remained the civil capital of galatia i as well as its ecclesiastical center
emperor arcadius frequently used the city as his summer residence and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early th century is found in the works of palladius of galatia and nilus of ancyra
in the rebel marcian attacked the city without being able to capture it
in comentiolus brother of emperor phocas launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against heraclius
ten years later in or more likely it was captured by the sassanid persians during the byzantine sassanid war of
although the city returned to byzantine hands after the end of the war the persian presence left traces in the citys archeology and likely began the process of its transformation from a late antique city to a medieval fortified settlement
in the city also known in arabic sources as qalat as salasil was captured for the first time by the arabs of the rashidun caliphate under muawiyah the future founder of the umayyad caliphate
at about the same time the themes were established in anatolia and ancyra became capital of the opsician theme which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under emperor constantine v ancyra then became the capital of the new bucellarian theme
the city was captured at least temporarily by the umayyad prince maslama ibn hisham in the last of the umayyads territorial gains from the byzantine empire
ancyra was attacked without success by abbasid forces in and in
in emperor nikephoros i strengthened its fortifications a fact which probably saved it from sack during the large scale invasion of anatolia by caliph harun al rashid in the next year
arab sources report that harun and his successor al mamun took the city but this information is later invention
in however during the amorium campaign the armies of caliph al mutasim converged and met at the city abandoned by its inhabitants ancara was razed to the ground before the arab armies went on to besiege and destroy amorium reaching as far as smyrna
in emperor michael iii came to the city during a campaign against the arabs and ordered its fortifications restored
in the city was menaced but not taken by the paulicians under chrysocheir
the last arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in by the abbasid governor of tarsus thamal al dulafi but the city again was not captured
early christian martyrs of ancyra about whom little is known included proklos and hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of kallippi and suffered repression under the emperor trajan
in the s we hear of philumenos a christian corn merchant from southern anatolia being captured and martyred in ankara and eustathius
as in other roman towns the reign of diocletian marked the culmination of the persecution of the christians
in ancyra was one of the towns where the co emperors diocletian and his deputy galerius launched their anti christian persecution
in ancyra their first target was the year old bishop of the town whose name was clement
clements life describes how he was taken to rome then sent back and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he and his brother and various companions were put to death
the remains of the church of st
clement can be found today in a building just off iklar caddesi in the ulus district
quite possibly this marks the site where clement was originally buried
four years later a doctor of the town named plato and his brother antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under galerius
theodotus of ancyra is also venerated as a saint
however the persecution proved unsuccessful and in ancyra was the center of an important council of the early church its disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the sacrament of penance
the synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the christian church after the persecutions and in particular the treatment of lapsi christians who had given in to forced paganism to avoid martyrdom during these persecutions
though paganism was probably tottering in ancyra in clements day it may still have been the majority religion
twenty years later christianity and monotheism had taken its place
ancyra quickly turned into a christian city with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes
the town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead
during the middle of the th century ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of christ and a form of arianism seems to have originated there
in emperor julian passed through ancyra on his way to an ill fated campaign against the persians and according to christian sources engaged in a persecution of various holy men
the stone base for a statue with an inscription describing julian as lord of the whole world from the british ocean to the barbarian nations can still be seen built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of ankara castle
the column of julian which was erected in honor of the emperors visit to the city in still stands today
in arian bishops met at ancyra and deposed several bishops among them st
gregory of nyssa
in the late th century ancyra became something of an imperial holiday resort
after constantinople became the east roman capital emperors in the th and th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the bosporus to the drier mountain atmosphere of ancyra
theodosius ii kept his court in ancyra in the summers
laws issued in ancyra testify to the time they spent there
the metropolis of ancyra continued to be a residential see of the eastern orthodox church until the th century with about faithful mostly turkish speaking but that situation ended as a result of the convention concerning the exchange of greek and turkish populations
the earlier armenian genocide put an end to the residential eparchy of ancyra of the armenian catholic church which had been established in
it is also a titular metropolis of the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople
both the ancient byzantine metropolitan archbishopric and the modern armenian eparchy are now listed by the catholic church as titular sees with separate apostolic successions
after the battle of manzikert in the seljuk turks overran much of anatolia
by the turkish settlers had reached the vicinity of ancyra and the city was captured shortly after at the latest by the time of the rebellion of nikephoros melissenos in
in when the crusade under raymond iv of toulouse arrived the city had been under danishmend control for some time
the crusaders captured the city and handed it over to the byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos
byzantine rule did not last long and the city was captured by the seljuk sultanate of rum at some unknown point in it returned to danishmend control until when the seljuks of rum retook it
after the battle of kse da in in which the mongols defeated the seljuks most of anatolia became part of the dominion of the mongols
taking advantage of seljuk decline a semi religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ahiler chose angora as their independent city state in
orhan the second bey of the ottoman empire captured the city in
timur defeated bayezid i at the battle of ankara in and took the city but in angora was again under ottoman control
the levant company maintained a factory in the town from to
in the th century its population was estimated at to
it was sacked by egyptians under ibrahim pasha in
from to the city served as the capital of the angora vilayet which included most of ancient galatia
prior to world war i the town had a british consulate and a population of around roughly of whom were christian
following the ottoman defeat in world war i the ottoman capital constantinople and much of anatolia was occupied by the allies who planned to share these lands between armenia france greece italy and the united kingdom leaving for the turks the core piece of land in central anatolia
in response the leader of the turkish nationalist movement mustafa kemal atatrk established the headquarters of his resistance movement in angora in

when ankara became the capital of the republic of turkey in it was designated as a planned city for future inhabitants
during the s s and s the city grew in a planned and orderly pace
however from the s onward the city grew much faster than envisioned because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city to seek a better standard of living
as a result many illegal houses called gecekondu were built around the city causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of ankara as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough

while the chp has always gained between and of the vote in ankaya since political support elsewhere throughout ankara was minimal
the high population within ankaya as well as yenimahalle to an extent has allowed the chp to take overall second place behind the ak party in both local and general elections with the mhp a close third despite the fact that the mhp was politically stronger than the chp in almost every other district

ankara is noted within turkey for the multitude of universities it is home to
these include the following several of them being among the most reputable in the country ankara is home to a world famous domestic cat breed the turkish angora called ankara kedisi in turkish
turkish angoras are one of the ancient naturally occurring cat breeds having originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia
they mostly have a white silky medium to long length coat no undercoat and a fine bone structure
there seems to be a connection between the angora cats and persians and the turkish angora is also a distant cousin of the turkish van
although they are known for their shimmery white coat there are more than twenty varieties including black blue and reddish fur
they come in tabby and tabby white along with smoke varieties and are in every color other than pointed lavender and cinnamon eyes may be blue green or amber or even one blue and one amber or green
the w gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located
however a great many blue and odd eyed white cats have normal hearing and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors
ears are pointed and large eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile
another characteristic is the tail which is often kept parallel to the back
the angora goat is a breed of domestic goat that originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia
this breed was first mentioned in the time of moses roughly in bc
the first angora goats were brought to europe by charles v holy roman emperor about but like later imports were not very successful
angora goats were first introduced in the united states in by james p
seven adult goats were a gift from sultan abdlmecid i in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton
the fleece taken from an angora goat is called mohair
a single goat produces between of hair per year
angoras are shorn twice a year unlike sheep which are shorn only once
angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth
a poor quality diet will curtail mohair development
the united states turkey and south africa are the top producers of mohair
for a long period of time angora goats were bred for their white coat
in the colored angora goat breeders association was set up to promote breeding of colored angoras
today angora goats produce white black red and brownish fiber
angora goats were depicted on the reverse of the turkish lira banknotes of emission group fifty turkish lira i
emission group fifty turkish lira i
series ii
series the angora rabbit is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long soft hair
the angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit originating in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia along with the angora cat and angora goat
the rabbits were popular pets with french royalty in the mid th century and spread to other parts of europe by the end of the century
they first appeared in the united states in the early th century
they are bred largely for their long angora wool which may be removed by shearing combing or plucking
angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft
they have a humorous appearance as they oddly resemble a fur ball
most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully
grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit
a condition called wool block is common in angora rabbits and should be treated quickly
sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat
arabic is a central semitic language of the afroasiatic language family spoken primarily in the arab world
the iso assigns language codes to varieties of arabic including its standard form of literary arabic known as modern standard arabic which is derived from classical arabic
this distinction exists primarily among western linguists arabic speakers themselves generally do not distinguish between modern standard arabic and classical arabic but rather refer to both as or simply
arabic is the third most widespread official language after english and french one of six official languages of the united nations and is the liturgical language of islam
arabic is widely taught in schools and universities around the world and is used to varying degrees in workplaces governments and the media
during the middle ages arabic was a major vehicle of culture especially in science mathematics and philosophy
as a result many european languages have also borrowed many words from it
arabic influence mainly in vocabulary is seen in european languages mainly spanish and to a lesser extent portuguese catalan and sicilian owing to both the proximity of european and the long lasting arabic cultural and linguistic presence mainly in southern iberia during the al andalus era
the maltese language is a semitic language developed from a dialect of arabic and written in the latin alphabet
the balkan languages including greek and bulgarian have acquired many words of arabic origin especially through direct contact with ottoman turkish
arabic has influenced many other languages around the globe throughout its history especially languages of muslim cultures and countries that were conquered by muslims
some of the most influenced languages are persian turkish hindustani kashmiri kurdish bosnian kazakh bengali malay maldivian pashto punjabi albanian armenian azerbaijani sicilian spanish greek bulgarian tagalog sindhi odia hebrew and hausa and some languages in parts of africa such as somali and swahili
conversely arabic has borrowed words from other languages including aramaic as well as hebrew latin greek persian and to a lesser extent turkish english french and other semitic languages
arabic is spoken by as many as million speakers both native and non native in the arab world making it the fifth most spoken language in the world and the fourth most used language on the internet in terms of users
it also serves as the liturgical language of more than billion muslims
in bloomberg businessweek ranked arabic the fourth most useful language for business after english standard mandarin chinese and french
arabic is written with the arabic alphabet which is an abjad script and is written from right to left although the spoken varieties are sometimes written in ascii latin from left to right with no standardized orthography
arabic is usually classified as a central semitic language
linguists still differ as to the best classification of semitic language sub groups
the semitic languages changed between proto semitic and the emergence of central semitic languages particularly in grammar
innovations of the central semitic languages all maintained in arabic include there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hejaz
these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor proto arabic
the following features of proto arabic can be reconstructed with confidence on the other hand several arabic varieties are closer to other semitic languages and maintain features not found in classical arabic indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from classical arabic
thus arabic vernaculars do not descend from classical arabic classical arabic is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor
arabia had a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity
the term arab was initially used to describe those living in the arabian peninsula as perceived by geographers from ancient greece
in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside the ancient south arabian family were spoken
it is believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages were spoken in southern arabia at this time
to the north in the oases of northern hejaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages
in and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested
in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic
on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested
the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic
linguists generally believe that old arabic a collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of arabic first emerged during the iron age
previously the earliest attestation of old arabic was thought to be a single st century ce inscription in sabaic script at in southern present day saudi arabia
however this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the arabic language group such as the conversion of semitic mimation to nunation in the singular
it is best reassessed as a separate language on the central semitic dialect continuum
it was also thought that old arabic coexisted alongside and then gradually displaced epigraphic ancient north arabian which was theorized to have been the regional tongue for many centuries
ana despite its name was considered a very distinct language and mutually unintelligible from arabic
scholars named its variant dialects after the towns where the inscriptions were discovered
however most arguments for a single ana language or language family were based on the shape of the definite article a prefixed h
it has been argued that the h is an archaism and not a shared innovation and thus unsuitable for language classification rendering the hypothesis of an ana language family untenable
safaitic and hismaic previously considered ana should be considered old arabic due to the fact that they participate in the innovations common to all forms of arabic
the earliest attestation of continuous arabic text in an ancestor of the modern arabic script are three lines of poetry by a man named garmallhe found in en avdat israel and dated to around ce
this is followed by the namara inscription an epitaph of the king imru al qays bar amro dating to ce found at namaraa syria
from the th to the th centuries the nabataean script evolved into the arabic script recognizable from the early islamic era
there are inscriptions in an undotted letter arabic script dating to the th century ce found at four locations in syria
the oldest surviving papyrus in arabic dates to ce and it uses dots to produce the modern letter arabic alphabet
the language of that papyrus and of the quran is referred to by linguists as quranic arabic as distinct from its codification soon thereafter into classical arabic
in late pre islamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hejaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the nd and rd century of the hijra most strongly in judeo christian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the learned tradition
this variety and both its classicizing and lay iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an old higazi register
it is clear that the orthography of the quran was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higazi
in the late th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal poetic koine distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd probably in connection with the court of al ra
during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabic writing persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue
their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of non standardized classical arabic elements in morphology and syntax
abu al aswad al duali is credited with standardizing arabic grammar or an naw and pioneering a system of diacritics to differentiate consonants and indicate vocalization
al khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi compiled the first arabic dictionary kitb al ayn and is credited with establishing the rules of arabic prosody
al jahiz proposed to al akhfash al akbar an overhaul of the grammar of arabic but it would not come to pass for two centuries
the standardization of arabic reached completion around the end of the th century
the first comprehensive description of the arabiyya arabic sbawayhis al kitb is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts in addition to quran usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the arabiyya
arabic spread with the spread of islam
following the early muslim conquests arabic gained vocabulary from middle persian and turkish
in the early abbasid period many classical greek terms entered arabic through translations carried out at baghdads house of wisdom
by the th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world both for muslims and non muslims
for example maimonides the andalusi jewish philosopher authored works in judeo arabic arabic written in hebrew script
ibn jinni of mosul a pioneer in phonology wrote prolifically in the th century on arabic morphology and phonology in works such as kitb al munif kitb al mutasab and
ibn mada of cordoba realized the overhaul of arabic grammar first proposed by al jahiz years prior
the maghrebi lexicographer ibn manzur compiled lisn al arab a major reference dictionary of arabic in
charles fergusons koine theory claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests this view has been challenged in recent times
ahmad al jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests northern and central
the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests
instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories
according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples
pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa
in around the th and th centuries in al andalus the zajal and muwashah poetry forms developed in the dialectical arabic of cordoba and the maghreb
the nahda was a cultural and especially literary renaissance of the th century in which writers sought to fuse arabic and european forms of expression
according to james l
gelvin nahda writers attempted to simplify the arabic language and script so that it might be accessible to a wider audience
in the wake of the industrial revolution and european hegemony and colonialism pioneering arabic presses such as the amiri press established by muhammad ali dramatically changed the diffusion and consumption of arabic literature and publications
rifaa al tahtawi proposed the establishment of madrasat al alsun in and led a translation campaign that highlighted the need for a lexical injection in arabic to suit concepts of the industrial and post industrial age
in response a number of arabic academies modeled after the were established with the aim of developing standardized additions to the arabic lexicon to suit these transformations first in damascus then in cairo baghdad rabat amman and tunis
they review language development monitor new words and approve the inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries
they also publish old and historical arabic manuscripts
in a bureau of arabization standardization was added to the educational cultural and scientific organization of the arab league
these academies and organizations have worked toward the arabization of the sciences creating terms in arabic to describe new concepts toward the standardization of these new terms throughout the arabic speaking world and toward the development of arabic as a world language
this gave rise to what western scholars call modern standard arabic
from the s arabization became a postcolonial nationalist policy in countries such as tunisia algeria morocco and sudan
arabic usually refers to standard arabic which western linguists divide into classical arabic and modern standard arabic
it could also refer to any of a variety of regional vernacular arabic dialects which are not necessarily mutually intelligibleclassical arabic is the language found in the quran used from the period of pre islamic arabia to that of the abbasid caliphate
classical arabic is prescriptive according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries
modern standard arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary
however it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties
much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the industrial and post industrial era especially in modern times
due to its grounding in classical arabic modern standard arabic is removed over a millennium from everyday speech which is construed as a multitude of dialects of this language
these dialects and modern standard arabic are described by some scholars as not mutually comprehensible
the former are usually acquired in families while the latter is taught in formal education settings
however there have been studies reporting some degree of comprehension of stories told in the standard variety among preschool aged children
the relation between modern standard arabic and these dialects is sometimes compared to that of classical latin and vulgar latin vernaculars in medieval and early modern europe
msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa and the middle east and understood by most educated arabic speakers
literary arabic and standard arabic are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabic
msa uses much classical vocabulary that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa
in addition msa has borrowed or coined many terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve
some words have been borrowed from other languages notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation
the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use loan translations or to coin new words using forms within existing roots
an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse newspaper other documentaries concerning kurosawas life and works produced posthumously include ancient egypt was a civilization of ancient northeast africa
it was concentrated along the lower reaches of the nile river situated in the place that is now the country egypt
ancient egyptian civilization followed prehistoric egypt and coalesced around bc with the political unification of upper and lower egypt under menes
the history of ancient egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative instability known as intermediate periods
the various kingdoms fall into one of three categories the old kingdom of the early bronze age the middle kingdom of the middle bronze age or the new kingdom of the late bronze age
ancient egypt reached the pinnacle of its power during the new kingdom ruling much of nubia and a sizable portion of the levant
after this period it entered an era of slow decline
during the course of its history ancient egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers including the hyksos the nubians the assyrians the achaemenid persians and the macedonians under alexander the great
the greek ptolemaic kingdom formed in the aftermath of alexanders death ruled until bc when under cleopatra it fell to the roman empire and became a roman province
egypt remained under roman control until the s ad when it was conquered by the rashidun caliphate
the success of ancient egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the nile river valley for agriculture
the predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture
with resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and a military intended to assert egyptian dominance
motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of a pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs
the many achievements of the ancient egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks a system of mathematics a practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the hittites
ancient egypt has left a lasting legacy
its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world
its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia
a newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by europeans and egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy
the nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history
the fertile floodplain of the nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization
nomadic modern human hunter gatherers began living in the nile valley through the end of the middle pleistocene some years ago
by the late paleolithic period the arid climate of northern africa had become increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region
in predynastic and early dynastic times the egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today
large regions of egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates
foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the nile region supported large populations of waterfowl
hunting would have been common for egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated
by about bc small tribes living in the nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads
the largest of these early cultures in upper egypt was the badarian culture which probably originated in the western desert it was known for its high quality ceramics stone tools and its use of copper
the badari was followed by the naqada culture the naqada i the naqada ii and naqada iii
these brought a number of technological improvements
as early as the naqada i period predynastic egyptians imported obsidian from ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes
mutual trade with the levant was established during naqada ii this period was also the beginning of trade with mesopotamia which continued into the early dynastic period and beyond
over a period of about years the naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the nile valley
establishing a power center at nekhen and later at abydos naqada iii leaders expanded their control of egypt northwards along the nile
they also traded with nubia to the south the oases of the western desert to the west and the cultures of the eastern mediterranean and near east to the east
the naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personal use items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory
they also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the roman period to decorate cups amulets and figurines
during the last predynastic phase the naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient egyptian language
the early dynastic period was approximately contemporary to the early sumerian akkadian civilization of mesopotamia and of ancient elam
the third centurybc egyptian priest manetho grouped the long line of kings from menes to his own time into dynasties a system still used today
he began his official history with the king named meni who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of upper and lower egypt
the transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient egyptian writers represented and there is no contemporary record of menes
some scholars now believe however that the mythical menes may have been the king narmer who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial narmer palette in a symbolic act of unification
in the early dynastic period which began about bc the first of the dynastic kings solidified control over lower egypt by establishing a capital at memphis from which he could control the labor force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the levant
the increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at abydos which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death
the strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land labor and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient egyptian civilization
major advances in architecture art and technology were made during the old kingdom fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population made possible by a well developed central administration
some of ancient egypts crowning achievements the giza pyramids and great sphinx were constructed during the old kingdom
under the direction of the vizier state officials collected taxes coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield drafted peasants to work on construction projects and established a justice system to maintain peace and order
with the rising importance of central administration in egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services
kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death
scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of egypt and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration
as the power of the kings diminished regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king
this coupled with severe droughts between and bc is believed to have caused the country to enter the year period of famine and strife known as the first intermediate period
after egypts central government collapsed at the end of the old kingdom the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy
regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small scale civil wars
yet despite difficult problems local leaders owing no tribute to the king used their new found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces
once in control of their own resources the provinces became economically richer which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes
in bursts of creativity provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the old kingdom and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period
free from their loyalties to the king local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
by bc rulers in herakleopolis controlled lower egypt in the north while a rival clan based in thebes the intef family took control of upper egypt in the south
as the intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable
around bc the northern theban forces under nebhepetre mentuhotep ii finally defeated the herakleopolitan rulers reuniting the two lands
they inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the middle kingdom
the kings of the middle kingdom restored the countrys stability and prosperity thereby stimulating a resurgence of art literature and monumental building projects
mentuhotep ii and his eleventh dynasty successors ruled from thebes but the vizier amenemhat i upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the twelfth dynasty around bc shifted the kingdoms capital to the city of itjtawy located in faiyum
from itjtawy the kings of the twelfth dynasty undertook a far sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region
moreover the military reconquered territory in nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines while laborers built a defensive structure in the eastern delta called the walls of the ruler to defend against foreign attack
with the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal the nations population arts and religion flourished
in contrast to elitist old kingdom attitudes towards the gods the middle kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety
middle kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident eloquent style
the relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication
the last great ruler of the middle kingdom amenemhat iii allowed semitic speaking canaanite settlers from the near east into the delta region to provide a sufficient labor force for his especially active mining and building campaigns
these ambitious building and mining activities however combined with severe nile floods later in his reign strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the second intermediate period during the later thirteenth and fourteenth dynasties
during this decline the canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the delta region eventually coming to power in egypt as the hyksos
around bc as the power of the middle kingdom kings weakened a western asian people called the hyksos who had already settled in the delta seized control of egypt and established their capital at avaris forcing the former central government to retreat to thebes
the king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute
the hyksos retained egyptian models of government and identified as kings thereby integrating egyptian elements into their culture
they and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into egypt most notably the composite bow and the horse drawn chariot
after retreating south the native theban kings found themselves trapped between the canaanite hyksos ruling the north and the hyksos nubian allies the kushites to the south
after years of vassalage thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than years until bc
the kings seqenenre tao ii and kamose were ultimately able to defeat the nubians to the south of egypt but failed to defeat the hyksos
that task fell to kamoses successor ahmose i who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the hyksos presence in egypt
he established a new dynasty and in the new kingdom that followed the military became a central priority for the kings who sought to expand egypts borders and attempted to gain mastery of the near east
the new kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours including the mitanni empire assyria and canaan
military campaigns waged under tuthmosis i and his grandson tuthmosis iii extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire egypt had ever seen
beginning with merneptah the rulers of egypt adopted the title of pharaoh
between their reigns hatshepsut a queen who established herself as pharaoh launched many building projects including the restoration of temples damaged by the hyksos and sent trading expeditions to punt and the sinai
when tuthmosis iii died in bc egypt had an empire extending from niya in north west syria to the fourth cataract of the nile in nubia cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood
the new kingdom pharaohs began a large scale building campaign to promote the god amun whose growing cult was based in karnak
they also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements both real and imagined
the karnak temple is the largest egyptian temple ever built
around bc the stability of the new kingdom was threatened when amenhotep iv ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms
changing his name to akhenaten he touted the previously obscure sun deity aten as the supreme deity suppressed the worship of most other deities and moved the capital to the new city of akhetaten
he was devoted to his new religion and artistic style
after his death the cult of the aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored
the subsequent pharaohs tutankhamun ay and horemheb worked to erase all mention of akhenatens heresy now known as the amarna period
around bc ramesses ii also known as ramesses the great ascended the throne and went on to build more temples erect more statues and obelisks and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history
a bold military leader ramesses ii led his army against the hittites in the battle of kadesh and after fighting to a stalemate finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around bc
egypts wealth however made it a tempting target for invasion particularly by the libyan berbers to the west and the sea peoples a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the aegean sea
initially the military was able to repel these invasions but egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern canaan much of it falling to the assyrians
the effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption tomb robbery and civil unrest
after regaining their power the high priests at the temple of amun in thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth and their expanded power splintered the country during the third intermediate period
following the death of ramesses xi in bc smendes assumed authority over the northern part of egypt ruling from the city of tanis
the south was effectively controlled by the high priests of amun at thebes who recognized smendes in name only
during this time libyans had been settling in the western delta and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy
libyan princes took control of the delta under shoshenq i in bc founding the so called libyan or bubastite dynasty that would rule for some years
shoshenq also gained control of southern egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions
libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in leontopolis and kushites threatened from the south
around bc the kushite king piye invaded northward seizing control of thebes and eventually the delta which established the th dynasty
during the th dynasty pharaoh taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the new kingdoms
twenty fifth dynasty pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the nile valley including at memphis karnak kawa and jebel barkal
during this period the nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids since the middle kingdom
egypts far reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the third intermediate period
its foreign allies had fallen under the assyrian sphere of influence and by bc war between the two states became inevitable
between and bc the assyrians began the assyrian conquest of egypt
the reigns of both taharqa and his successor tanutamun were filled with constant conflict with the assyrians against whom egypt enjoyed several victories
ultimately the assyrians pushed the kushites back into nubia occupied memphis and sacked the temples of thebes
the assyrians left control of egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the saite kings of the twenty sixth dynasty
by bc the saite king psamtik i was able to oust the assyrians with the help of greek mercenaries who were recruited to form egypts first navy
greek influence expanded greatly as the city state of naucratis became the home of greeks in the nile delta
the saite kings based in the new capital of sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture but in bc the powerful persians led by cambyses ii began their conquest of egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh psamtik iii at the battle of pelusium
cambyses ii then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled egypt from iran leaving egypt under the control of a satrap
a few successful revolts against the persians marked the th centurybc but egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the persians
following its annexation by persia egypt was joined with cyprus and phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the achaemenid persian empire
this first period of persian rule over egypt also known as the twenty seventh dynasty ended in bc when egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties
the last of these dynasties the thirtieth proved to be the last native royal house of ancient egypt ending with the kingship of nectanebo ii
a brief restoration of persian rule sometimes known as the thirty first dynasty began in bc but shortly after in bc the persian ruler mazaces handed egypt over to alexander the great without a fight
in bc alexander the great conquered egypt with little resistance from the persians and was welcomed by the egyptians as a deliverer
the administration established by alexanders successors the macedonian ptolemaic kingdom was based on an egyptian model and based in the new capital city of alexandria
the city showcased the power and prestige of hellenistic rule and became a centre of learning and culture that included the famous library of alexandria as part of the mouseion
the lighthouse of alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city as the ptolemies made commerce and revenue generating enterprises such as papyrus manufacturing their top priority
hellenistic culture did not supplant native egyptian culture as the ptolemies supported time honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace
they built new temples in egyptian style supported traditional cults and portrayed themselves as pharaohs
some traditions merged as greek and egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities such as serapis and classical greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional egyptian motifs
despite their efforts to appease the egyptians the ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion bitter family rivalries and the powerful mob of alexandria that formed after the death of ptolemy iv
in addition as rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from egypt the romans took great interest in the political situation in the country
continued egyptian revolts ambitious politicians and powerful opponents from the near east made this situation unstable leading rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire
egypt became a province of the roman empire in bc following the defeat of mark antony and ptolemaic queen cleopatra vii by octavian in the battle of actium
the romans relied heavily on grain shipments from egypt and the roman army under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor quelled rebellions strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes and prevented attacks by bandits which had become a notorious problem during the period
alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient as exotic luxuries were in high demand in rome
although the romans had a more hostile attitude than the greeks towards the egyptians some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued
the art of mummy portraiture flourished and some roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs though not to the extent that the ptolemies had
the former lived outside egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of egyptian kingship
local administration became roman in style and closed to native egyptians
from the mid first century ad christianity took root in egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted
however it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan egyptian and greco roman religions and threatened popular religious traditions
this led to the persecution of converts to christianity culminating in the great purges of diocletian starting in but eventually christianity won out
in the christian emperor theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples
alexandria became the scene of great anti pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed
as a consequence egypts native religious culture was continually in decline
while the native population continued to speak their language the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished
the temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert
in the fourth century as the roman empire divided egypt found itself in the eastern empire with its capital at constantinople
in the waning years of the empire egypt fell to the sasanian persian army in the sasanian conquest of egypt
it was then recaptured by the byzantine emperor heraclius and was finally captured by muslim rashidun army in marking the end of both byzantine rule and of the period typically considered ancient egypt
the pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and at least in theory wielded complete control of the land and its resources
the king was the supreme military commander and head of the government who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs
in charge of the administration was his second in command the vizier who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys the treasury building projects the legal system and the archives
at a regional level the country was divided into as many as administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction
the temples formed the backbone of the economy
not only were they places of worship but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdoms wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers who redistributed grain and goods
much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled
although the ancient egyptians did not use coinage until the late period they did use a type of money barter system with standard sacks of grain and the deben a weight of roughly of copper or silver forming a common denominator
workers were paid in grain a simple laborer might earn sacks of grain per month while a foreman might earn sacks
prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading for example a shirt cost five copper deben while a cow cost deben
grain could be traded for other goods according to the fixed price list
during the fifth centurybc coined money was introduced into egypt from abroad
at first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage
egyptian society was highly stratified and social status was expressly displayed
farmers made up the bulk of the population but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state temple or noble family that owned the land
farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system
artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers but they were also under state control working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury
scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient egypt known as the white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank
the upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature
below the nobility were the priests physicians and engineers with specialized training in their field
it is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient egypt there is difference of opinions among authors
the ancient egyptians viewed men and women including people from all social classes as essentially equal under the law and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress
although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants they were able to buy and sell their servitude work their way to freedom or nobility and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace
both men and women had the right to own and sell property make contracts marry and divorce receive inheritance and pursue legal disputes in court
married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end
compared with their counterparts in ancient greece rome and even more modern places around the world ancient egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices legal rights and opportunities for achievement
women such as hatshepsut and cleopatra vii even became pharaohs while others wielded power as divine wives of amun
despite these freedoms ancient egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration aside from the royal high priestesses apparently served only secondary roles in the temples and were not so probably to be as educated as men
the head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh who was responsible for enacting laws delivering justice and maintaining law and order a concept the ancient egyptians referred to as maat
although no legal codes from ancient egypt survive court documents show that egyptian law was based on a common sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes
local councils of elders known as kenbet in the new kingdom were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes
more serious cases involving murder major land transactions and tomb robbery were referred to the great kenbet over which the vizier or pharaoh presided
plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth
in some cases the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co conspirators
whether the charges were trivial or serious court scribes documented the complaint testimony and verdict of the case for future reference
punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines beatings facial mutilation or exile depending on the severity of the offense
serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution carried out by decapitation drowning or impaling the criminal on a stake
punishment could also be extended to the criminals family
beginning in the new kingdom oracles played a major role in the legal system dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases
the procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue
the god carried by a number of priests rendered judgement by choosing one or the other moving forward or backward or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon
a combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient egyptian culture the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the nile river
the ancient egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural technological and artistic pursuits
land management was crucial in ancient egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned
farming in egypt was dependent on the cycle of the nile river
the egyptians recognized three seasons akhet peret and shemu
the flooding season lasted from june to september depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineral rich silt ideal for growing crops
after the floodwaters had receded the growing season lasted from october to february
farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields which were irrigated with ditches and canals
egypt received little rainfall so farmers relied on the nile to water their crops
from march to may farmers used sickles to harvest their crops which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain
winnowing removed the chaff from the grain and the grain was then ground into flour brewed to make beer or stored for later use
the ancient egyptians cultivated emmer and barley and several other cereal grains all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer
flax plants uprooted before they started flowering were grown for the fibers of their stems
these fibers were split along their length and spun into thread which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing
papyrus growing on the banks of the nile river was used to make paper
vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots close to habitations and on higher ground and had to be watered by hand
vegetables included leeks garlic melons squashes pulses lettuce and other crops in addition to grapes that were made into wine
the egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order thus humans animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole
animals both domesticated and wild were therefore a critical source of spirituality companionship and sustenance to the ancient egyptians
cattle were the most important livestock the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them
in addition to cattle the ancient egyptians kept sheep goats and pigs
poultry such as ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were force fed with dough to fatten them
the nile provided a plentiful source of fish
bees were also domesticated from at least the old kingdom and provided both honey and wax
the ancient egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil
the slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual
horses were introduced by the hyksos in the second intermediate period
camels although known from the new kingdom were not used as beasts of burden until the late period
there is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the late period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land
cats dogs and monkeys were common family pets while more exotic pets imported from the heart of africa such as sub saharan african lions were reserved for royalty
herodotus observed that the egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses
during the late period the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular such as the cat goddess bastet and the ibis god thoth and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice
egypt is rich in building and decorative stone copper and lead ores gold and semiprecious stones
these natural resources allowed the ancient egyptians to build monuments sculpt statues make tools and fashion jewelry
embalmers used salts from the wadi natrun for mummification which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster
ore bearing rock formations were found in distant inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the sinai requiring large state controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there
there were extensive gold mines in nubia and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region
the wadi hammamat was a notable source of granite greywacke and gold
flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the nile valley
nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose
ancient egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances
the egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at gebel rosas to make net sinkers plumb bobs and small figurines
copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the sinai
workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits or by the more labor intensive process of grinding and washing gold bearing quartzite
iron deposits found in upper egypt were used in the late period
high quality building stones were abundant in egypt the ancient egyptians quarried limestone all along the nile valley granite from aswan and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert
deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry greywacke alabaster and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the first dynasty
in the ptolemaic and roman periods miners worked deposits of emeralds in wadi sikait and amethyst in wadi el hudi
the ancient egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare exotic goods not found in egypt
in the predynastic period they established trade with nubia to obtain gold and incense
they also established trade with palestine as evidenced by palestinian style oil jugs found in the burials of the first dynasty pharaohs
an egyptian colony stationed in southern canaan dates to slightly before the first dynasty
narmer had egyptian pottery produced in canaan and exported back to egypt
by the second dynasty at latest ancient egyptian trade with byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in egypt
by the fifth dynasty trade with punt provided gold aromatic resins ebony ivory and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons
egypt relied on trade with anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze
the ancient egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli which had to be imported from far away afghanistan
egypts mediterranean trade partners also included greece and crete which provided among other goods supplies of olive oil
the egyptian language is a northern afro asiatic language closely related to the berber and semitic languages
it has the longest known history of any language having been written from c
bc to the middle ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer
the phases of ancient egyptian are old egyptian middle egyptian late egyptian demotic and coptic
egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before coptic but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around memphis and later thebes
ancient egyptian was a synthetic language but it became more analytic later on
late egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles which replaced the older inflectional suffixes
there was a change from the older verb subject object word order to subject verb object
the egyptian hieroglyphic hieratic and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic coptic alphabet
coptic is still used in the liturgy of the egyptian orthodox church and traces of it are found in modern egyptian arabic
ancient egyptian has consonants similar to those of other afro asiatic languages
these include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants voiced and voiceless stops voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates
it has three long and three short vowels which expanded in late egyptian to about nine
the basic word in egyptian similar to semitic and berber is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants
suffixes are added to form words
the verb conjugation corresponds to the person
for example the triconsonantal skeleton is the semantic core of the word hear its basic conjugation is he hears
if the subject is a noun suffixes are not added to the verb the woman hears
adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with arabic
the word order is in verbal and adjectival sentences and in nominal and adverbial sentences
the subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun
verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences
stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable which can be open or closed
hieroglyphic writing dates from bc and is composed of hundreds of symbols
a hieroglyph can represent a word a sound or a silent determinative and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts
hieroglyphs were a formal script used on stone monuments and in tombs that could be as detailed as individual works of art
in day to day writing scribes used a cursive form of writing called hieratic which was quicker and easier
while formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction hieratic was always written from right to left usually in horizontal rows
a new form of writing demotic became the prevalent writing style and it is this form of writing along with formal hieroglyphs that accompany the greek text on the rosetta stone
around the first century ad the coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the demotic script
coptic is a modified greek alphabet with the addition of some demotic signs
although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them
as the traditional religious establishments were disbanded knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost
attempts to decipher them date to the byzantine and islamic periods in egypt but only in the s after the discovery of the rosetta stone and years of research by thomas young and jean franois champollion were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered
writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs
it was primarily an occupation of the scribes who worked out of the per ankh institution or the house of life
the latter comprised offices libraries laboratories and observatories
some of the best known pieces of ancient egyptian literature such as the pyramid and coffin texts were written in classical egyptian which continued to be the language of writing until about bc
late egyptian was spoken from the new kingdom onward and is represented in ramesside administrative documents love poetry and tales as well as in demotic and coptic texts
during this period the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography such as those of harkhuf and weni
the genre known as sebayt was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles the ipuwer papyrus a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval is a famous example
the story of sinuhe written in middle egyptian might be the classic of egyptian literature
also written at this time was the westcar papyrus a set of stories told to khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests
the instruction of amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near eastern literature
towards the end of the new kingdom the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces such as the story of wenamun and the instruction of any
the former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from lebanon and of his struggle to return to egypt
from about bc narrative stories and instructions such as the popular instructions of onchsheshonqy as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of egyptian
many stories written in demotic during the greco roman period were set in previous historical eras when egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as ramesses ii
most ancient egyptians were farmers tied to the land
their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day
each home had a kitchen with an open roof which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread
ceramics served as household wares for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food drink and raw materials
walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings
floors were covered with reed mats while wooden stools beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture
the ancient egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance
most bathed in the nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk
men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin
clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs jewelry and cosmetics
children went without clothing until maturity at about age and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved
mothers were responsible for taking care of the children while the father provided the familys income
music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them
early instruments included flutes and harps while instruments similar to trumpets oboes and pipes developed later and became popular
in the new kingdom the egyptians played on bells cymbals tambourines drums and imported lutes and lyres from asia
the sistrum was a rattle like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies
the ancient egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities including games and music
senet a board game where pieces moved according to random chance was particularly popular from the earliest times another similar game was mehen which had a circular gaming board
hounds and jackals also known as holes is another example of board games played in ancient egypt
the first complete set of this game was discovered from a theban tomb of the egyptian pharaoh amenemhat iv that dates to the th dynasty
juggling and ball games were popular with children and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at beni hasan
the wealthy members of ancient egyptian society enjoyed hunting fishing and boating as well
the excavation of the workers village of deir el medina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world which spans almost four hundred years
there is no comparable site in which the organization social interactions and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail
egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time indeed the cuisine of modern egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients
the staple diet consisted of bread and beer supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic and fruit such as dates and figs
wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis
fish meat and fowl could be salted or dried and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill
the architecture of ancient egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world the great pyramids of giza and the temples at thebes
building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes but also to reinforce the wide ranging power of the pharaoh
the ancient egyptians were skilled builders using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today
the domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood and have not survived
peasants lived in simple homes while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures
a few surviving new kingdom palaces such as those in malkata and amarna show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people birds water pools deities and geometric designs
important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks
the architectural elements used in the worlds first large scale stone building djosers mortuary complex include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif
the earliest preserved ancient egyptian temples such as those at giza consist of single enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns
in the new kingdom architects added the pylon the open courtyard and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary a style that was standard until the greco roman period
the earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the old kingdom was the mastaba a flat roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber
the step pyramid of djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other
pyramids were built during the old and middle kingdoms but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock cut tombs
the use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the new kingdom and in the royal pyramids of nubia
the ancient egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes
for over years artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the old kingdom following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change
these artistic standards simple lines shapes and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth created a sense of order and balance within a composition
images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls coffins stelae and even statues
the narmer palette for example displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs
because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance ancient egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity
ancient egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute
paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores copper ores soot or charcoal and limestone
paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes which could be moistened with water when needed
pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle royal decrees and religious scenes
common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art such as shabti statues and books of the dead which they believed would protect them in the afterlife
during the middle kingdom wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb
in an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife these models show laborers houses boats and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient egyptian afterlife
despite the homogeneity of ancient egyptian art the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes
after the invasion of the hyksos in the second intermediate period minoan style frescoes were found in avaris
the most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the amarna period where figures were radically altered to conform to akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas
this style known as amarna art was quickly abandoned after akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms
beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient egyptian civilization from its inception pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings
the egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection
however the gods were not always viewed as benevolent and egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers
the structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system
these various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality
gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf
at the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine
temples were not places of public worship or congregation and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship
normally the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials
common citizens could worship private statues in their homes and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos
after the new kingdom the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was de emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods
as a result priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people
the egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects
in addition to the body each person had a wt a ba a ka and a name
the heart rather than the brain was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions
after death the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will but they required the physical remains as a permanent home
the ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead living on as an akh or effective one
for this to happen the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth
if deemed worthy the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form
if they were not deemed worthy their heart was eaten by ammit the devourer and they were erased from the universe
the ancient egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death
these customs involved preserving the body by mummification performing burial ceremonies and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife
before the old kingdom bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation
the arid desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient egypt for burials of the poor who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite
wealthier egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification which involved removing the internal organs wrapping the body in linen and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin
beginning in the fourth dynasty some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars
by the new kingdom the ancient egyptians had perfected the art of mummification the best technique took days and involved removing the internal organs removing the brain through the nose and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron
the body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin
mummies of the late period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases
actual preservation practices declined during the ptolemaic and roman eras while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy which was decorated
wealthy egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items but all burials regardless of social status included goods for the deceased
funerary texts were often included in the grave and beginning in the new kingdom so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife
rituals in which the deceased was magically re animated accompanied burials
after burial living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased
the ancient egyptian military was responsible for defending egypt against foreign invasion and for maintaining egypts domination in the ancient near east
the military protected mining expeditions to the sinai during the old kingdom and fought civil wars during the first and second intermediate periods
the military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes such as those found at the city of buhen on the way to nubia
forts also were constructed to serve as military bases such as the fortress at sile which was a base of operations for expeditions to the levant
in the new kingdom a series of pharaohs used the standing egyptian army to attack and conquer kush and parts of the levant
typical military equipment included bows and arrows spears and round topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame
in the new kingdom the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the hyksos invaders
weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle spears were tipped with a bronze point and the khopesh was adopted from asiatic soldiers
the pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs such as seqenenre tao ii and his sons did do so
however it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders fighting alongside their troops
soldiers were recruited from the general population but during and especially after the new kingdom mercenaries from nubia kush and libya were hired to fight for egypt
in technology medicine and mathematics ancient egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication
traditional empiricism as evidenced by the edwin smith and ebers papyri is first credited to egypt
the egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system
even before the old kingdom the ancient egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience which they treated as a type of artificial semi precious stone
faience is a non clay ceramic made of silica small amounts of lime and soda and a colorant typically copper
the material was used to make beads tiles figurines and small wares
several methods can be used to create faience but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core which was then fired
by a related technique the ancient egyptians produced a pigment known as egyptian blue also called blue frit which is produced by fusing silica copper lime and an alkali such as natron
the product can be ground up and used as a pigment
the ancient egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently
it is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre made ingots which they melted and finished
however they did have technical expertise in making objects as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass
a range of colors could be produced including yellow red green blue purple and white and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque
the medical problems of the ancient egyptians stemmed directly from their environment
living and working close to the nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites which caused liver and intestinal damage
dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat
the lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body
the grit and sand from stone ground flour abraded teeth leaving them susceptible to abscesses
the diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars which promoted periodontal disease
despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence
adult life expectancy was about for men and for women but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one third of the population died in infancy
ancient egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient near east for their healing skills and some such as imhotep remained famous long after their deaths
herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among egyptian physicians with some treating only the head or the stomach while others were eye doctors and dentists
training of physicians took place at the per ankh or house of life institution most notably those headquartered in per bastet during the new kingdom and at abydos and sas in the late period
medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy injuries and practical treatments
wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat white linen sutures nets pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection while opium thyme and belladona were used to relieve pain
the earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies
prayers were made to the goddess isis
moldy bread honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns
garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms
ancient egyptian surgeons stitched wounds set broken bones and amputated diseased limbs but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred
early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as bc
the archaeological institute of america reports that the oldest planked ships known are the abydos boats
a group of discovered ships in abydos were constructed of wooden planks sewn together
discovered by egyptologist david oconnor of new york university woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams
because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to pharaoh khasekhemwy originally they were all thought to have belonged to him but one of the ships dates to bc and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating
the ship dating to bc was long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh perhaps one as early as hor aha
early egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together using pitch for caulking the seams
the khufu ship a vessel sealed into a pit in the giza pyramid complex at the foot of the great pyramid of giza in the fourth dynasty around bc is a full size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque
early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints
large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern mediterranean especially byblos and in several expeditions down the red sea to the land of punt
in fact one of the earliest egyptian words for a seagoing ship is a byblos ship which originally defined a class of egyptian seagoing ships used on the byblos run however by the end of the old kingdom the term had come to include large seagoing ships whatever their destination
in an ancient north south canal was discovered extending from lake timsah to the ballah lakes
it was dated to the middle kingdom of egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course
in archaeologists from italy the united states and egypt excavating a dried up lagoon known as mersa gawasis unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages such as hatshepsuts punt expedition onto the open ocean
some of the sites most evocative evidence for the ancient egyptians seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes made from papyrus coiled in huge bundles
in a team of franco egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the worlds oldest port dating back about years from the time of king khufu on the red sea coast near wadi el jarf
the earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic naqada period and show a fully developed numeral system
the importance of mathematics to an educated egyptian is suggested by a new kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land labor and grain
texts such as the rhind mathematical papyrus and the moscow mathematical papyrus show that the ancient egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations addition subtraction multiplication and division use fractions calculate the areas of rectangles triangles and circles and compute the volumes of boxes columns and pyramids
they understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve systems of equations
mathematical notation was decimal and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million
each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number so to write the number eighty or eight hundred the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively
because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions
for example they resolved the fraction two fifths into the sum of one third one fifteenth
standard tables of values facilitated this
some common fractions however were written with a special glyph the equivalent of the modern two thirds is shown on the right
ancient egyptian mathematicians knew the pythagorean theorem as an empirical formula
they were aware for example that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a ratio
they were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one ninth from its diameter and squaring the result a reasonable approximation of the formula
estimates of the size of the population range from million in the rd millennium bc to possibly million by the st millennium bc before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium
according to historian william stiebling and archaeologist susan n
helft conflicting dna analysis on recent genetic samples such as the amarna royal mummies has led to a lack of consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient egyptians and their geographic origins
the genetic history of ancient egypt remains a developing field and is relevant for the understanding of population demographic events connecting africa and eurasia
to date the amount of genome wide adna analyses on ancient specimens from egypt and sudan remain scarce although studies on uniparental haplogroups in ancient individuals have been carried out several times pointing broadly to affinities with other african and eurasian groups
the currently most advanced full genome analyses was made on three ancient specimens recovered from the nile river valley abusir el meleq egypt
two of the individuals were dated to the pre ptolemaic period and one individual to the ptolemaic period spanning around years of egyptian history
these results point to a genetic continuity of ancient egyptians with modern egyptians
the results further point to a close genetic affinity between ancient egyptians and middle eastern populations especially ancient groups from the levant
ancient egyptians also displayed affinities to nubians to the south of egypt in modern day sudan
archaeological and historical evidence support interactions between egyptian and nubian populations more than years ago with socio political dynamics between egyptians and nubians ranging from peaceful coexistence to variably successful attempts of conquest
a study on sixty six ancient nubian individuals revealed significant contact with ancient egyptians characterized by the presence of neolithic bronze age levantine ancestry in these individuals
such geneflow of levantine like ancestry corresponds with archaeological and botanic evidence pointing to a neolithic movement around years ago
genetic data on other northern african specimens such as the year old iberomaurusian taforalt man but also specimens from the last green sahara and the savanna pastoral neolithic point to the widespread presence of an eurasian ancestry component distributed throughout northern africa the sahara and the horn of africa having arrived via back migration from the middle east starting as early as years ago
modern egyptians like modern nubians underwent subsequent admixture events contributing both sub saharan african like and west asian like ancestries since the roman period with significance on the african slave trade and the spread of islam
some scholars such as christopher ehret caution that a wider sampling area is needed and argue that the current data is inconclusive on the origin of ancient egyptians
they also point out issues with the previously used methodology such as the sampling size comparative approach and a biased interpretation of the genetic data
they argue in favor for a link between ancient egypt and the northern horn of africa
this latter view has been attributed to the corresponding archaeological genetic linguistic and biological anthropological sources of evidence which broadly indicate that the earliest egyptians and nubians were the descendants of populations in northeast africa
the culture and monuments of ancient egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world
egyptian civilization significantly influenced the kingdom of kush and mero with both adopting egyptian religious and architectural norms were built in egypt sudan as well as using egyptian writing as the basis of the meroitic script
meroitic is the oldest written language in africa other than egyptian and was used from the nd century bc until the early th century ad
the cult of the goddess isis for example became popular in the roman empire as obelisks and other relics were transported back to rome
the romans also imported building materials from egypt to erect egyptian style structures
early historians such as herodotus strabo and diodorus siculus studied and wrote about the land which romans came to view as a place of mystery
during the middle ages and the renaissance egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of christianity and later islam but interest in egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as dhul nun al misri and al maqrizi
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries european travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys leading to a wave of egyptomania across europe as evident in symbolism such as the eye of providence and the great seal of the united states
this renewed interest sent collectors to egypt who took purchased or were given many important antiquities
napoleon arranged the first studies in egyptology when he brought some scientists and artists to study and document egypts natural history which was published in the description de lgypte
in the th century the egyptian government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations
since the s the ministry of tourism and antiquities has overseen excavations and the recovery of artifacts

motor neuron diseases or motor neurone diseases are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body
they include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressive bulbar palsy pseudobulbar palsy progressive muscular atrophy primary lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy and monomelic amyotrophy as well as some rarer variants resembling als
motor neuron diseases affect both children and adults
while each motor neuron disease affects patients differently they all cause movement related symptoms mainly muscle weakness
most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes but some forms are inherited
studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes that are thought to be important in understanding how the disease occurs
symptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life
most of these diseases worsen over time while some such as als shorten ones life expectancy others do not
currently there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders and care is mostly symptomatic
signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement related symptoms
they come on slowly and worsen over the course of more than three months
various patterns of muscle weakness are seen and muscle cramps and spasms may occur
one can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs difficulty breathing when lying down or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved
bulbar symptoms including difficulty speaking difficulty swallowing and excessive saliva production can also occur
sensation or the ability to feel is typically not affected
emotional disturbance and cognitive and behavioural changes are also seen
there can be lower motor neuron findings upper motor neuron findings or both
motor neuron diseases are seen both in children and adults
those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk
those that affect adults tend to appear after age
the clinical course depends on the specific disease but most progress or worsen over the course of months
some are fatal while others are not
various patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases
weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric and it can occur in body parts that are distal proximal or both
according to statland et al
there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases which are motor neuron diseases are on a spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement
some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings while others have a mix of both
lower motor neuron findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations and upper motor neuron findings include hyperreflexia spasticity muscle spasm and abnormal reflexes
pure upper motor neuron diseases or those with just umn findings include pls
pure lower motor neuron diseases or those with just lmn findings include pma
motor neuron diseases with both umn and lmn findings include both familial and sporadic als
most cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known
it is thought that environmental toxic viral or genetic factors may be involved
tar dna binding protein is a critical component of the non homologous end joining enzymatic pathway that repairs dna double strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons
tdp is rapidly recruited to double strand breaks where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the xrcc dna ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double strand breaks
about of als patients have abnormalities in the nucleus cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of tdp
in tdp depleted human neural stem cell derived motor neurons as well as in sporadic als patients spinal cord specimens there is significant double strand break accumulation and reduced levels of nhej
in adults men are more commonly affected than women
differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms shared between several motor neuron diseases
frequently the diagnosis is based on clinical findings family history of mnd and a variation of tests many of which are used to rule out disease mimics which can manifest with identical symptoms
motor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on electrophysiological testing
the term motor neuron disease has varying meanings in different countries
similarly the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term motor neuron disease
the four main types of mnd are marked in the table below
sporadic or acquired mnds occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease
inherited or genetic mnds adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or x linked
some disorders like als can occur sporadically or can have a genetic cause with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease
umns are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord
lmns originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles
both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle but damage to an umn can be distinguished from damage to a lmn by physical exam
there are no known curative treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders
please refer to the articles on individual disorders for more details
the table below lists life expectancy for patients who are diagnosed with mnd
in the united states and canada the term motor neuron disease usually refers to the group of disorders while amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is frequently called lou gehrigs disease
in the united kingdom and australia the term motor neuron disease is used for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although is not uncommon to refer to the entire group
while mnd refers to a specific subset of similar diseases there are numerous other diseases of motor neurons that are referred to collectively as motor neuron disorders for instance the diseases belonging to the spinal muscular atrophies group
however they are not classified as motor neuron diseases by the th edition of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems which is the definition followed in this article
an abjad also abgad is a writing system in which only consonants are represented leaving the vowel sounds to be inferred by the reader
this contrasts with alphabets which provide graphemes for both consonants and vowels
the term was introduced in by peter t
other terms for the same concept include partial phonemic script segmentally linear defective phonographic script consonantary consonant writing and consonantal alphabet
impure abjads represent vowels with either optional diacritics a limited number of distinct vowel glyphs or both
the name abjad is based on the arabic alphabets first four letters corresponding to a b j and d to replace the more common terms consonantary and consonantal alphabet in describing the family of scripts classified as west semitic
similar to other semitic languages such as phoenician hebrew and semitic proto alphabets specifically aleph bet gimel dalet
according to the formulations of peter t
daniels abjads differ from alphabets in that only consonants not vowels are represented among the basic graphemes
abjads differ from abugidas another category defined by daniels in that in abjads the vowel sound is implied by phonology and where vowel marks exist for the system such as nikkud for hebrew and arakt for arabic their use is optional and not the dominant form
abugidas mark all vowels with a diacritic a minor attachment to the letter a standalone glyph or by rotation of the letter
some abugidas use a special symbol to suppress the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented
in a syllabary a grapheme denotes a complete syllable that is either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds
the contrast of abjad versus alphabet has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term for the arabic numeral system
also it may be taken as suggesting that consonantal alphabets in contrast to eg the greek alphabet were not yet true alphabets
florian coulmas a critic of daniels and of the abjad terminology argues that this terminology can confuse alphabets with transcription systems and that there is no reason to relegate the hebrew aramaic or phoenician alphabets to second class status as an incomplete alphabet
however danielss terminology has found acceptance in the linguistic community
the first abjad to gain widespread usage was the phoenician abjad
unlike other contemporary scripts such as cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphs the phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols
this made the script easy to learn and seafaring phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then known world
the phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically much as manygana was used to represent japanese phonetically before the invention of kana
phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems including the widely used aramaic abjad and the greek alphabet
the greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets such as latin and cyrillic while aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of asia
impure abjads have characters for some vowels optional vowel diacritics or both
the term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators
however most modern abjads such as arabic hebrew aramaic and pahlavi are impure abjadsthat is they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes although the said non diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants particularly approximants that sound similar to long vowels
a pure abjad is exemplified by very early forms of ancient phoenician though at some point it and most of the contemporary semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers called matres lectionis
this practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times
in the th century bc the greeks adapted the phoenician script for use in their own language
the phonetic structure of the greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented so the script was modified
they did not need letters for the guttural sounds represented by aleph he heth or ayin so these symbols were assigned vocalic values
the letters waw and yod were also adapted into vowel signs along with he these were already used as matres lectionis in phoenician
the major innovation of greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants
abugidas developed along a slightly different route
the basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent a vowel sound
hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel
in this way the south arabian abjad evolved into the geez abugida of ethiopia between the th century bc and the th century ad
similarly the brhm abugida of the indian subcontinent developed around the rd century bc
the other major family of abugidas canadian aboriginal syllabics was initially developed in the s by missionary and linguist james evans for the cree and ojibwe languages
evans used features of devanagari script and pitman shorthand to create his initial abugida
later in the th century other missionaries adapted evanss system to other canadian aboriginal languages
canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol with each vowel having a consistent orientation
the abjad form of writing is well adapted to the morphological structure of the semitic languages it was developed to write
this is because words in semitic languages are formed from a root consisting of three consonants the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms
for instance according to classical arabic and modern standard arabic from the arabic root k t b can be derived the forms wrote and
in most cases the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots and improving word recognition while reading for practiced readers
by contrast the arabic and hebrew scripts sometimes perform the role of true alphabets rather than abjads when used to write certain indo european languages including kurdish bosnian yiddish and some romance languages such as mozarabic aragonese portuguese spanish and ladino
an abugida sometimes also called alphasyllabary neosyllabary or pseudo alphabetis a segmental writing system in which consonant vowel sequences are written as units each unit is based on a consonant letter and vowel notation is secondary similar to a diacritical mark
this contrasts with a full alphabet in which vowels have status equal to consonants and with an abjad in which vowel marking is absent partial or optional in less formal contexts all three types of the script may be termed alphabets
the terms also contrast them with a syllabary in which a single symbol denotes the combination of one consonant and one vowel
related concepts were introduced independently in by james germain fvrier and david diringer then in by fred householder
the ethiopic term abugida was chosen as a designation for the concept in by peter t
in faber suggested segmentally coded syllabically linear phonographic script and in bright used the term alphasyllabary and gnanadesikan and rimzhim katz fowler have suggested aksara or ksharik
abugidas include the extensive brahmic family of scripts of tibet south and southeast asia semitic ethiopic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics
as is the case for syllabaries the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants
for scripts of the brahmic family the term akshara is used for the units
in several languages of ethiopia and eritrea abugida traditionally meant letters of the ethiopic or geez script in which many of these languages are written
geez is one of several segmental writing systems in the world others include indic brahmic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics
the word abugida is derived from the four letters bu gi and da in much the same way that abecedary is derived from latin letters a be ce de abjad is derived from the arabic a b j d and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the greek alphabet alpha and beta
abugida as a term in linguistics was proposed by peter t
daniels in his typology of writing systems
as daniels used the word an abugida is in contrast with a syllabary where letters with shared consonant or vowel sounds show no particular resemblance to one another
furthermore an abugida is also in contrast with an alphabet proper where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels
the term alphasyllabary was suggested for the indic scripts in by william bright following south asian linguistic usage to convey the idea that they share features of both alphabet and syllabary
the formal definitions given by daniels and bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ some writing systems are abugidas but not alphasyllabaries and some are alphasyllabaries but not abugidas
an abugida is defined as a type of writing system whose basic characters denote consonants followed by a particular vowel and in which diacritics denote other vowels
an alphasyllabary is defined as a type of writing system in which the vowels are denoted by subsidiary symbols not all of which occur in a linear order that is congruent with their temporal order in speech
bright did not require that an alphabet explicitly represent all vowels
phags pa is an example of an abugida because it has an inherent vowel but it is not an alphasyllabary because its vowels are written in linear order
modern lao is an example of an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida for there is no inherent vowel and its vowels are always written explicitly and not in accordance to their temporal order in speech meaning that a vowel can be written before below or above a consonant letter while the syllable is still pronounced in the order of a consonant vowel combination
the fundamental principles of an abugida apply to words made up of consonant vowel syllables
the syllables are written as letters in a straight line where each syllable is either a letter that represents the sound of a consonant and its inherent vowel or a letter modified to indicate the vowel
letters can be modified either by means of diacritics or by changes in the form of the letter itself
if all modifications are by diacritics and all diacritics follow the direction of the writing of the letters then the abugida is not an alphasyllabary
however most languages have words that are more complicated than a sequence of cv syllables even ignoring tone
the first complication is syllables that consist of just a vowel
for some languages a zero consonant letter is used as though every syllable began with a consonant
for other languages each vowel has a separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel
these letters are known as independent vowels and are found in most indic scripts
these letters may be quite different from the corresponding diacritics which by contrast are known as dependent vowels
as a result of the spread of writing systems independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with a glottal stop even for non initial syllables
the next two complications are consonant clusters before a vowel and syllables ending in a consonant
the simplest solution which is not always available is to break with the principle of writing words as a sequence of syllables and use a letter representing just a consonant
this final consonant may be represented with in a true abugida the lack of distinctive vowel marking of the letter may result from the diachronic loss of the inherent vowel eg by syncope and apocope in hindi
when not separating syllables containing consonant clusters into c cv these syllables are often written by combining the two consonants
in the indic scripts the earliest method was simply to arrange them vertically writing the second consonant of the cluster below the first one
the two consonants may also merge as conjunct consonant letters where two or more letters are graphically joined in a ligature or otherwise change their shapes
rarely one of the consonants may be replaced by a gemination mark eg the gurmukhi addak
when they are arranged vertically as in burmese or khmer they are said to be stacked
often there has been a change to writing the two consonants side by side
in the latter case this combination may be indicated by a diacritic on one of the consonants or a change in the form of one of the consonants eg the half forms of devanagari
generally the reading order of stacked consonants is top to bottom or the general reading order of the script but sometimes the reading order can be reversed
the division of a word into syllables for the purposes of writing does not always accord with the natural phonetics of the language
for example brahmic scripts commonly handle a phonetic sequence cvc cv as cv ccv or cv c cv
however sometimes phonetic cvc syllables are handled as single units and the final consonant may be represented more complicated unit structures are handled by combining the various techniques above
examples using the devanagari script there are three principal families of abugidas depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by diacritics distortion or orientation
lao and tna have dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign but no inherent vowel
indic scripts originated in india and spread to southeast asia bangladesh sri lanka nepal bhutan tibet mongolia and russia
all surviving indic scripts are descendants of the brahmi alphabet
today they are used in most languages of south asia mainland southeast asia tibet indonesian archipelago philippines malaysia
the primary division is with north indic scripts used in northern india nepal tibet bhutan mongolia and russia and southern indic scripts used in south india sri lanka and southeast asia
south indic letter forms are more rounded than north indic forms though odia golmol and litumol of nepal script are rounded
most north indic scripts full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top with gujarati and odia as exceptions south indic scripts do not
indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs around the consonants often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel
if a consonant has no vowel sign this indicates a default vowel
vowel diacritics may appear above below to the left to the right or around the consonant
the most widely used indic script is devanagari shared by hindi bihari marathi konkani nepali and often sanskrit
a basic letter such as in hindi represents a syllable with the default vowel in this case ka
in some languages including hindi it becomes a final closing consonant at the end of a word in this case k
the inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel mark producing syllables such as ki ku ke ko
in many of the brahmic scripts a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking so a vowel marker like i falling before the character it modifies may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced
for example the game cricket in hindi is the diacritic for appears before the consonant cluster not before the
a more unusual example is seen in the batak alphabet here the syllable bim is written ba ma i
that is the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable
in many abugidas there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel yielding the bare consonant
in devanagari is k and is l
this is called the virma or halantam in sanskrit
it may be used to form consonant clusters or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word
thus in sanskrit a default vowel consonant such as does not take on a final consonant sound
instead it keeps its vowel
for writing two consonants without a vowel in between instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel another popular method of special conjunct forms is used in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster such as devanagari kla
thus a closed syllable such as kal requires two aksharas to write
the rng script used for the lepcha language goes further than other indic abugidas in that a single akshara can represent a closed syllable not only the vowel but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic
for example the syllable would be written as something like s here with an underring representing and an overcross representing the diacritic for final
most other indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics such as or if they can indicate any at all
in ethiopic or geez script fidels have diacritics that are fused with the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters
children learn each modification separately as in a syllabary nonetheless the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant are readily apparent unlike the case in a true syllabary
though now an abugida the geez script until the advent of christianity had originally been what would now be termed an abjad
in the geez abugida the base form of the letter may be altered
for example h hu hi h or
in the family known as canadian aboriginal syllabics which was inspired by the devanagari script of india vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the syllabogram
each vowel has a consistent orientation for example inuktitut pi pu pa ti tu ta
although there is a vowel inherent in each all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic
bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics or by superscript versions of the aksharas there is no vowel killer mark
abjads are typically written without indication of many vowels
however in some contexts like teaching materials or scriptures arabic and hebrew are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks making them effectively alphasyllabaries
the arabic scripts used for kurdish in iraq and for uyghur in xinjiang china as well as the hebrew script of yiddish are fully vowelled but because the vowels are written with full letters rather than diacritics and there are no inherent vowels these are considered alphabets not abugidas
the arabic script used for south azerbaijani generally writes the vowel as a diacritic but writes all other vowels as full letters
this means that when no vowel diacritics are present it technically has an inherent vowel
however like the phagspa and meroitic scripts whose status as abugidas is controversial all other vowels are written in line
additionally the practice of explicitly writing all but one vowel does not apply to loanwords from arabic and persian so the script does not have an inherent vowel for arabic and persian words
the inconsistency of its vowel notation makes it difficult to categorize
the imperial mongol script called phagspa was derived from the tibetan abugida but all vowels are written in line rather than as diacritics
however it retains the features of having an inherent vowel a and having distinct initial vowel letters
pahawh hmong is a non segmental script that indicates syllable onsets and rimes such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants
thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida
however it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed
most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime onset even though they are pronounced as onset rime rather like the position of the vowel in devanagari which is written before the consonant
pahawh is also unusual in that while an inherent rime is unwritten it also has an inherent onset
for the syllable which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt it is that is written
thus it is the rime that is basic to the system
it is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other segmental scripts
for example the meroitic script of ancient sudan did not indicate an inherent a and is thus similar to brahmic family of abugidas
however the other vowels were indicated with full letters not diacritics or modification so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel
several systems of shorthand use diacritics for vowels but they do not have an inherent vowel and are thus more similar to thaana and kurdish script than to the brahmic scripts
the gabelsberger shorthand system and its derivatives modify the following consonant to represent vowels
the pollard script which was based on shorthand also uses diacritics for vowels the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates tone
pitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter circle marks in different orientations as the principal alphabet of consonants vowels are shown as light and heavy dots dashes and other marks in one of possible positions to indicate the various vowel sounds
however to increase writing speed pitman has rules for vowel indication using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel marks can be dispensed with
as the term alphasyllabary suggests abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between alphabets and syllabaries
historically abugidas appear to have evolved from abjads
they contrast with syllabaries where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant vowel combination and where these have no systematic similarity to each other and typically develop directly from logographic scripts
compare the examples above to sets of syllables in the japanese hiragana syllabary ka ki ku ke ko have nothing in common to indicate k while ra ri ru re ro have neither anything in common for r nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set
most indian and indochinese abugidas appear to have first been developed from abjads with the kharoh and brhm scripts the abjad in question is usually considered to be the aramaic one but while the link between aramaic and kharosthi is more or less undisputed this is not the case with brahmi
the kharosthi family does not survive today but brahmis descendants include most of the modern scripts of south and southeast asia
geez derived from a different abjad the sabean script of yemen the advent of vowels coincided with the introduction or adoption of christianity about ad
the ethiopic script is the elaboration of an abjad
the cree syllabary was invented with full knowledge of the devanagari system
the meroitic script was developed from egyptian hieroglyphs within which various schemes of group writing had been used for showing vowels

agnetha fltskog sang with a local dance band who sent a demo recording of their music to karl gerhard lundkvist
the demo tape featured a song written and sung by agnetha jag var s kr
lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star
after going through considerable effort to locate the singer he arranged for agnetha to come to stockholm and to record two of her own songs
this led to agnetha at the age of having a number one record in sweden with a self composed song which later went on to sell over copies
she was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer songwriter of schlager style songs
fltskogs main inspiration in her early years was singers such as connie francis
along with her own compositions she recorded covers of foreign hits and performed them on tours in swedish folkparks
most of her biggest hits were self composed which was quite unusual for a female singer in the s
agnetha released four solo lps between and
she had many successful singles in the swedish charts
bjrn ulvaeus also began his musical career at the age of when he fronted the hootenanny singers a popular swedish folk skiffle group
ulvaeus started writing english language songs for his group and even had a brief solo career alongside
the hootenanny singers and the hep stars sometimes crossed paths while touring
in june ulvaeus and andersson decided to write a song together
their first attempt was isnt it easy to say a song that was later recorded by the hep stars
stig anderson was the manager of the hootenanny singers and founder of the polar music label
he saw potential in the collaboration and encouraged them to write more
the two also began playing occasionally with the others bands on stage and on record although it was not until that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together ljuva sextital recorded by brita borg and the hep stars hit speleman
benny andersson became a member of a popular swedish pop rock group the hep stars that performed among other things covers of international hits
the hep stars were known as the swedish beatles
they also set up hep house their equivalent of apple corps
andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band many of which became major hits including no response which hit number three in and sunny girl wedding and consolation all of which hit number one in
andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with lasse berghagen with whom he wrote his first svensktoppen entry sagan om lilla sofie in
andersson wrote and submitted the song hej clown for melodifestivalen the national festival to select the swedish entry to the eurovision song contest
the song tied for first place but re voting relegated anderssons song to second place
on that occasion andersson briefly met his future spouse singer anni frid lyngstad who also participated in the contest
a month later the two had become a couple
as their respective bands began to break up during andersson and ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in called lycka which included original songs sung by both men
their partners were often present in the recording studio and sometimes added backing vocals fltskog even co wrote a song with the two
ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the hootenanny singers until the middle of and andersson took part in producing their records
anni frid frida lyngstad sang from the age of with various dance bands and worked mainly in a jazz oriented cabaret style
she also formed her own band the anni frid four
in the middle of she won a national talent competition with en ledig dag a swedish version of the bossa nova song a day in portofino which is included in the emi compilation frida
the first prize was a recording contract with emi sweden and to perform live on the most popular tv shows in the country
this tv performance among many others is included in the hour documentary frida the dvd
lyngstad released several schlager style singles on emi with mixed success
when benny andersson started to produce her recordings in she had her first number one single min egen stad written by benny and featuring all the future abba members on backing vocals
lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and tv
she had a second number one single with man vill ju leva lite dessemellan in late
she had met ulvaeus briefly in during a talent contest and fltskog during a tv show in early
lyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in
on march she participated in the melodifestival where she met andersson for the first time
a few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern sweden and they soon became a couple
andersson produced her single peter pan in september her first collaboration with benny bjrn as they had written the song
andersson would then produce lyngstads debut studio album frida which was released in march
lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in stockholm between and
after abba formed she recorded another successful album in frida ensam which included the original swedish rendition of fernando a hit on the swedish radio charts before the english version was released by abba
during filming of a swedish tv special in may fltskog met ulvaeus and they married on july
fltskog and ulvaeus eventually were involved in each others recording sessions and soon even andersson and lyngstad added backing vocals to fltskogs third studio album som jag r
in fltskog starred as mary magdalene in the original swedish production of jesus christ superstar and attracted favourable reviews
between and fltskog released five studio albums
an attempt at combining their talents occurred in april when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of cyprus
what started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the united nations soldiers stationed on the island
andersson and ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together lycka which was to be released in september
fltskog and lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during june and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act festfolket on november in gothenburg
the cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews except for the performance of the andersson and ulvaeus hit hej gamle man the first bjrn and benny recording to feature all four
they also performed solo numbers from respective albums but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being and each soon concentrated on individual projects again
hej gamle man a song about an old salvation army soldier became the quartets first hit
the record was credited to bjrn benny and reached number five on the sales charts and number one on svensktoppen staying on the latter chart for weeks
it was during that the four artists began working together more adding vocals to the others recordings
fltskog andersson and ulvaeus toured together in may while lyngstad toured on her own
frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer
after the release of lycka two more singles credited to bjrn benny were released in sweden det kan ingen doktor hjlpa and tnk om jorden vore ung with more prominent vocals by fltskog and lyngstad and moderate chart success
fltskog and ulvaeus now married started performing together with andersson on a regular basis at the swedish folkparks in the middle of
stig anderson founder and owner of polar music was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by andersson and ulvaeus
one day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit he predicted
stig anderson encouraged ulvaeus and andersson to write a song for melodifestivalen and after two rejected entries in andersson and ulvaeus submitted their new song sg det med en sng for the contest choosing newcomer lena anderson to perform
the song came in third place encouraging stig anderson and became a hit in sweden
the first signs of foreign success came as a surprise as the andersson and ulvaeus single shes my kind of girl was released through epic records in japan in march giving the duo a top hit
two more singles were released in japan en carousel and love has its ways
people need love also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the united states where it peaked at number on the cashbox singles chart and number on the record world singles chart
labelled as bjrn benny meaning swedish girl it was released there through playboy records
according to stig anderson people need love could have been a much bigger american hit but a small label like playboy records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers
in the band and their manager stig anderson decided to have another try at melodifestivalen this time with the song ring ring
the studio sessions were handled by michael b
tretow who experimented with a wall of sound production technique that became a distinctive new sound thereafter associated with abba
stig anderson arranged an english translation of the lyrics by neil sedaka and phil cody and they thought this would be a success
however on february the song came third in melodifestivalen thus it never reached the eurovision song contest itself
nevertheless the group released their debut studio album also called ring ring
the album did well and the ring ring single was a hit in many parts of europe and also in south africa
however stig anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a uk or us hit
when agnetha fltskog gave birth to her daughter linda in she was replaced for a short period by inger brundin on a trip to west germany
in stig anderson tired of unwieldy names started to refer to the group privately and publicly as abba
at first this was a play on words as abba is also the name of a well known fish canning company in sweden and itself an abbreviation
however since the fish canners were unknown outside sweden anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets
a competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as abba
the group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the namefred bronson reported for billboard that fltskog told him in a interview that had to ask permission and the factory said ok as long as you dont make us feel ashamed for what youre doing
abba is an acronym formed from the first letters of each group members first name agnetha bjrn benny anni frid although there has never been any official confirmation of who each letter in the sequence refers to
the earliest known example of abba written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the metronome studio in stockholm dated october
this was first written as bjrn benny agnetha frida but was subsequently crossed out with abba written in large letters on top
their official logo with its distinctive backward b was designed by rune sderqvist who designed most of abbas record sleeves
the ambigram first appeared on the french compilation album golden double album released in may by disques vogue and would henceforth be used for all official releases
the idea for the official logo was made by the german photographer on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine bravo
in the photo the abba members held giant initial letters of their names
after the pictures were made heilemann found out that benny andersson reversed his letter b this prompted discussions about the mirrored b and the members of abba agreed on the mirrored letter
from onward the first b in the logo version of the name was mirror image reversed on the bands promotional material
following their acquisition of the groups catalogue polygram began using variations of the abba logo employing a different font
in polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the abba gold greatest hits compilation
after universal music purchased polygram control of the groups catalogue returned to stockholm
since then the original logo has been reinstated on all official products
abba entered the melodifestivalen with ring ring but did not qualify as the swedish entry
stig anderson started planning for the contest
ulvaeus andersson and stig anderson saw possibilities in using the eurovision song contest to make the music business aware of them as songwriters as well as to publicise the band
in late they were invited by swedish television to contribute a song for the melodifestivalen and the upbeat song waterloo was chosen
the group were now inspired by the growing glam rock scene in england
with this third attempt abba were more experienced and better prepared for the eurovision song contest and they won the nations hearts on swedish television on february
winning the eurovision song contest on april and singing waterloo in english instead of their native tongue gave them the chance to tour europe and perform on major television shows as a result of which the waterloo single charted in many european countries
after winning the contest abba spent an evening of glory partying in the appropriately named first floor napoleon suite of the grand brighton hotel
waterloo was abbas first major hit and their first number one single in nine western and northern european countries including the major markets of the uk and west germany and in south africa
it made the top ten in other countries rising to number three in spain number four in australia and france and number seven in canada
in the united states the song peaked at number six on the billboard hot chart paving the way for their first album and their first trip to the us as a group
although only a short promotional visit this included their first performance on american television on the mike douglas show
the waterloo album peaked at only number on the billboard chart but received unanimous praise from us critics
the los angeles times said the album was a compelling and fascinating debut album that captured the spirit of mainstream pop and described it as immensely enjoyable and pleasant while creem said it was a perfect blend of exceptional lovable compositions
abbas follow up single honey honey peaked at number on the us billboard hot reached the top twenty in several other countries and was a number two hit in west germany although it only reached the top in australia and the us
in the uk abbas british record label epic decided to re release a remixed version of ring ring instead of honey honey
a cover version of honey honey by sweet dreams peaked at number and both records debuted on the uk chart within a week of each other
ring ring failed to reach the top in the uk increasing growing speculation that the group were simply a eurovision one hit wonder
in november abba embarked on their first european tour playing dates in denmark west germany and austria
it was not as successful as the band had hoped since most of the venues did not sell out
due to a lack of demand they were even forced to cancel a few shows including a sole concert scheduled in switzerland
the second leg of the tour which took them through scandinavia in january was very different
they played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for
live performances continued in the middle of when abba embarked on a fourteen open air date tour of sweden and finland
their stockholm show at the grna lund amusement park had an estimated audience of
bjrn ulvaeus later said if you look at the singles we released straight after waterloo we were trying to be more like the sweet a semi glam rock group which was stupid because we were always a pop group
in late so long was released as a single in the united kingdom but it received no airplay from radio and failed to chart in the uk the only countries in which it was successful were austria sweden and germany reaching the top ten in the first two and number in the latter
in the middle of abba released i do i do i do i do i do which again received little airplay on radio but did manage to climb to number on the uk chart while making top five in several northern and western european countries and number one in south africa
later that year the release of their self titled third studio album abba and single sos brought back their chart presence in the uk where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number
sos also became abbas second number one single in germany their third in australia and their first in france plus reached number two in several other european countries including italy
success was further solidified with mamma mia reaching number one in the united kingdom germany and australia and the top two in a few other western and northern european countries
in the united states both i do i do i do i do i do and sos peaked at number on the billboard hot chart with the latter picking up the bmi award along the way as one of the most played songs on american radio in
mamma mia however stalled at number
in canada the three songs rose to number nine and respectively
the success of the group in the united states had until that time been limited to single releases
by early the group already had four top singles on the us charts but the album market proved to be tough to crack
the eponymous abba album generated three american hits but it only peaked at number on the cashbox album chart and number on the billboard chart
opinions were voiced by creem in particular that in the us abba had endured a very sloppy promotional campaign
nevertheless the group enjoyed warm reviews from the american press
cashbox went as far as saying that there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in abbas marketing creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts while creem wrote sos is surrounded on this lp by so many good tunes that the mind boggles
in australia the airing of the music videos for i do i do i do i do i do and mamma mia on the nationally broadcast tv pop show countdown saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity and countdown become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos
this started an immense interest for abba in australia resulting in i do i do i do i do i do staying at number one for three weeks then sos spending a week there followed by mamma mia staying there for ten weeks and the album holding down the number one position for months
the three songs were also successful in nearby new zealand with the first two topping that chart and the third reaching number two
in march the band released the compilation album greatest hits
it became their first uk number one album and also took abba into the top on the us album charts for the first time eventually selling more than a million copies there
also included on greatest hits was a new single fernando which went to number one in at least thirteen countries all over the world including the uk germany france australia south africa and mexico and the top five in most other significant markets including at number four becoming their biggest hit to date in canada the single went on to sell over million copies worldwide
in australia fernando occupied the top position for a then record breaking weeks and was the longest running chart topper there for over years until it was overtaken by ed sheerans shape of you in may
it still remains as one of the best selling singles of all time in australia
also in the group received its first international prize with fernando being chosen as the best studio recording of
in the united states fernando reached the top of the cashbox top singles chart and number on the billboard hot
it topped the billboard adult contemporary chart abbas first american number one single on any chart
at the same time a compilation named the very best of abba was released in germany becoming a number one album there whereas the greatest hits compilation which followed a few months later ascended to number two in germany despite all similarities with the very best album
the groups fourth studio album arrival a number one best seller in parts of europe the uk and australia and a number three hit in canada and japan represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work prompting rave reviews from more rock oriented uk music weeklies such as melody maker and new musical express and mostly appreciative notices from us critics
hit after hit flowed from arrival money money money another number one in germany france australia and other countries of western and northern europe plus number three in the uk and knowing me knowing you abbas sixth consecutive german number one as well as another uk number one plus a top five hit in many other countries although it was only a number nine hit in australia and france
the real sensation was the first single dancing queen not only topping the charts in loyal markets like the uk germany sweden several other western and northern european countries and australia but also reaching number one in the united states canada the soviet union and japan and the top ten in france spain and italy
all three songs were number one hits in mexico
in south africa abba had astounding success with each of fernando dancing queen and knowing me knowing you being among the top best selling singles for
in arrival was nominated for the inaugural brit award in the category best international album of the year
by this time abba were popular in the uk most of europe australia new zealand and canada
in frida the dvd lyngstad explains how she and fltskog developed as singers as abbas recordings grew more complex over the years
the bands mainstream popularity in the united states would remain on a comparatively smaller scale and dancing queen became the only billboard hot number one single for abba with knowing me knowing you later peaking at number seven money money money however had barely charted there or in canada
they did however get three more singles to the number one position on other billboard us charts including billboard adult contemporary and hot dance club play
nevertheless arrival finally became a true breakthrough release for abba on the us album market where it peaked at number on the billboard chart and was certified gold by riaa
in january abba embarked on their first major tour
the groups status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars
they opened their much anticipated tour in oslo norway on january and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self written mini operetta the girl with the golden hair
the concert attracted huge media attention from across europe and australia
they continued the tour through western europe visiting gothenburg copenhagen berlin cologne amsterdam antwerp essen hanover and hamburg and ending with shows in the united kingdom in manchester birmingham glasgow and two sold out concerts at londons royal albert hall
tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box office received million requests for tickets enough to fill the venue times
along with praise there were complaints that abba performed slickly
but with a zero personality coming across from a total of people on stage
one of the royal albert hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the australian tour for what became though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed
after the european leg of the tour in march abba played dates in australia before a total of people
the opening concert in sydney at the sydney showground on march to an audience of was marred by torrential rain with lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert
however all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career
upon their arrival in melbourne a civic reception was held at the melbourne town hall and abba appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of
in melbourne the group gave three concerts at the sidney myer music bowl with at each including the australian prime minister malcolm fraser and his family
at the first melbourne concert an additional people gathered outside the fenced off area to listen to the concert
in adelaide the group performed one concert at football park in front of people with another listening outside
during the first of five concerts in perth there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the entertainment centre
the trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention and is captured on film in directed by lasse hallstrm
the australian tour and its subsequent abba the movie produced some abba lore as well
fltskogs blonde good looks had long made her the bands pin up girl a role she disdained
during the australian tour she performed in a skin tight white jumpsuit causing one australian newspaper to use the headline agnethas bottom tops dull show
when asked about this at a news conference she replied dont they have bottoms in australia in december abba followed up arrival with the more ambitious fifth album released to coincide with the debut of abba the movie
although the album was less well received by uk reviewers it did spawn more worldwide hits the name of the game and take a chance on me which both topped the uk charts and racked up impressive sales in most countries although the name of the game was generally the more successful in the nordic countries and down under while take a chance on me was more successful in north america and the german speaking countries
the name of the game was a number two hit in the netherlands belgium and sweden while also making the top in finland norway new zealand and australia while only peaking at numbers and in mexico the us and canada
take a chance on me was a number one hit in austria belgium and mexico made the top in the us canada the netherlands germany and switzerland while only reaching numbers and in australia and new zealand respectively
both songs were top hits in countries as far afield as rhodesia and south africa as well as in france
although take a chance on me did not top the american charts it proved to be abbas biggest hit single there selling more copies than dancing queen
the drop in sales in australia was felt to be inevitable by industry observers as an abba fever that had existed there for almost three years could only last so long as adolescents would naturally begin to move away from a group so deified by both their parents and grandparents
a third single eagle was released in continental europe and down under becoming a number one hit in belgium and a top hit in the netherlands germany switzerland and south africa but barely charting down under
the b side of eagle was thank you for the music and it was belatedly released as an a side single in both the united kingdom and ireland in
thank you for the music has become one of the best loved and best known abba songs without being released as a single during the groups lifetime
abba the album topped the album charts in the uk the netherlands new zealand sweden norway switzerland while ascending to the top in australia germany austria finland and rhodesia and making the top in canada and japan
sources also indicate that sales in poland exceeded million copies and that sales demand in russia could not be met by the supply available
the album peaked at number in the us

during may the group went to the united states for a promotional campaign performing alongside andy gibb on olivia newton johns tv show

the track would set the stage for abbas foray into disco with their next album

abba assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them
nonetheless the media continued to confront them with this in interviews
to escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing andersson and ulvaeus secretly travelled to compass point studios in nassau bahamas where for two weeks they prepared their next albums songs

all four singles reached number one in belgium although the last three did not chart in sweden or norway

it was a childrens musical using abba songs
alain and daniel boublil who wrote les misrables had been in touch with stig anderson about the project and the tv musical was aired over christmas on french tv and later a dutch version was also broadcast
boublil previously also wrote the french lyric for mireille mathieus version of the winner takes it all
lyngstad who had recently moved to paris participated in the french version and recorded a single belle a duet with french singer daniel balavoine
the song was a cover of abbas instrumental track arrival
as the single belle sold well in france cameron mackintosh wanted to stage an english language version of the show in london with the french lyrics translated by david wood and don black andersson and ulvaeus got involved in the project and contributed with one new song i am the seeker

in january fltskog started recording sessions for a solo album as lyngstad had successfully released her album somethings going on some months earlier
ulvaeus and andersson meanwhile started songwriting sessions for the musical chess
in interviews at the time bjrn and benny denied the split of abba and lyngstad and fltskog kept claiming in interviews that abba would come together for a new album repeatedly during and
internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in polar music during
except for a tv appearance in the foursome did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the swedish premiere of the mamma mia movie on july
the individual members endeavours shortly before and after their final public performance coupled with the collapse of both marriages and the lack of significant activity in the following few years after that widely suggested that the group had broken up
in an interview with the sunday telegraph following the premiere ulvaeus and andersson said that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again
ulvaeus said we will never appear on stage again
there is simply no motivation to re group
money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were
young exuberant full of energy and ambition
i remember robert plant saying led zeppelin were a cover band now because they cover all their own stuff
i think that hit the nail on the head
however on january fltskog long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion raised the possibility of reuniting for a one off engagement
she admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members
in april she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with die zeit stating if they ask me ill say yes
in a may interview fltskog aged at the time stated that an abba reunion would never occur i think we have to accept that it will not happen because we are too old and each one of us has their own life
too many years have gone by since we stopped and theres really no meaning in putting us together again
fltskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms its always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic
in an april interview fltskog when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said its difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be abba is going to record another song but as long as we can sing and play then why not i would love to but its up to bjrn and benny
the same year the members of abba went their separate ways the french production of a tribute show spawned new interest in the groups music
after receiving little attention during the mid to late s abbas music experienced a resurgence in the early s due to the uk synth pop duo erasure who released abba esque a four track extended play release featuring cover versions of abba songs which topped several european charts in

abba were perfectionists in the studio working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back to later on
they spent the bulk of their time within the studio in separate interviews ulvaeus stated they may have toured for only months while andersson said they played fewer than shows during the bands career
although counting shorter to minute concerts during their folkpark tours the group in fact played over shows
the band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer guitarist and bass player and overlaid other arrangements and instruments
vocals were then added and orchestra overdubs were usually left until last
fltskog and lyngstad contributed ideas at the studio stage
andersson and ulvaeus played them the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions
according to fltskog she and lyngstad had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped
abba was widely noted for the colourful and trend setting costumes its members wore
the reason for the wild costumes was swedish tax law the cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances
in their early years group member anni frid lyngstad designed and even hand sewed the outfits
later as their success grew they used professional theatrical clothes designer owe sandstrm together with tailor lars wigenius with lyngstad continuing to suggest ideas while co ordinating the outfits with concert set designs
choreography by graham tainton also contributed to their performance style
the videos that accompanied some of the bands biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre
most of abbas videos were directed by lasse hallstrm who would later direct the films my life as a dog the cider house rules and chocolat
abba made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible
this was also done in an effort to minimise travelling particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights
fltskog and ulvaeus had two young children and fltskog who was also afraid of flying was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time
abbas manager stig anderson realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour
some of these videos have become classics because of the s era costumes and early video effects such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs overlapping one singers profile with the others full face and the contrasting of one member against another
in abba participated in an advertising campaign to promote the matsushita electric industrial co
s brand national in australia
the campaign was also broadcast in japan
five commercial spots each of approximately one minute were produced each presenting the national song performed by abba using the melody and instrumental arrangements of fernando and revised lyrics

the band threatened to file a lawsuit against the df saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party
their record label universal music later stated that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached
during their active career from to of abbas singles entered the billboard hot of these made the top with making the top on both charts
a total of four of those singles reached the top including dancing queen which reached number one in april
while fernando and sos did not break the top on the billboard hot they did reach the top on cashbox and record world charts
both dancing queen and take a chance on me were certified gold by the recording industry association of america for sales of over one million copies each

on march abba was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame by bee gees members barry gibb and robin gibb
the ceremony was held at the waldorf astoria hotel in new york city
the group were represented by anni frid lyngstad and benny andersson
in november the group received a grammy nomination for record of the year
the single i still have faith in you from the album voyage was their first ever nomination
in november dont shut me down also from voyage was nominated for best pop duo group performance
the members of abba were married as follows agnetha fltskog and bjrn ulvaeus from to benny andersson and anni frid lyngstad from to
for their subsequent marriages see their articles
in addition to the four members of abba other musicians regularly played on their studio recordings live appearances and concert performances
these include studio albums documentaries often profess to show the real abba and may employ several methods of legitimising such claims such as the use of archival documents testimonies from music and cultural experts and interviews with the group members and fans
an allegiance is a duty of fidelity said to be owed or freely committed by the people subjects or citizens to their state or sovereign
the word allegiance comes from middle english
the al prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term allegiance an allegation
allegiance is formed from liege from old french liege free of germanic origin
the connection with latin to bind is erroneous
traditionally english legal commentators used the term allegiance in two ways
in one sense it referred to the deference which anyone even a foreigner was expected to pay to the institutions of the country where one lived
in the other sense it meant national character and the subjection due to that character
the english doctrine which was at one time adopted in the united states asserted that allegiance was indelible nemo potest exuere patriam
as the law stood prior to every person who by birth or naturalisation satisfied the conditions set forth even if removed in infancy to another country where their family resided owed an allegiance to the british crown which they could never resign or lose except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of british territory in which they resided
this refusal to accept any renunciation of allegiance to the crown led to conflict with the united states over impressment which led to further conflicts during the war of when thirteen irish american prisoners of war were executed as traitors after the battle of queenston heights winfield scott urged american reprisal but none was carried out
allegiance was the tie which bound the subject to the sovereign in return for that protection which the sovereign afforded the subject
it was the mutual bond and obligation between monarch and subjects whereby subjects were called their liege subjects because they are bound to obey and serve them and the monarch was called their liege lord because they should maintain and defend them el el er china navigation co v attorney general tlr attorney general v nissan all er oppenheimer v cattermole and arsenite as
in the united states since the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the environmental protection agency is ppb and the fda set the same standard in for bottled water
the department of environmental protection for new jersey set a drinking water limit of ppb in
the idlh value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is mg m
the occupational safety and health administration has set the permissible exposure limit to a time weighted average of mg m and the national institute for occupational safety and health has set the recommended exposure limit to a minute constant exposure of mg m
the pel for organic arsenic compounds is a twa of mg m
in based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of american foods for toxic chemicals the us food and drug administration set the level of concern for inorganic arsenic in apple and pear juices at ppb based on non carcinogenic effects and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level it also required recalls for non conforming domestic products
in the national dr oz television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers
though the methodology was disputed the tests showed levels of arsenic up to ppb
in response the fda tested the worst brand from the dr oz show and found much lower levels
ongoing testing found of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern
later testing by consumer reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above ppb and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption
in july on consideration of consumption by children chronic exposure and carcinogenic effect the fda established an action level of ppb for apple juice the same as the drinking water standard
concern about arsenic in rice in bangladesh was raised in but at the time only australia had a legal limit for food
concern was raised about people who were eating us rice exceeding who standards for personal arsenic intake in
in the peoples republic of china set a food standard of ppb for arsenic
in the united states in testing by separate groups of researchers at the childrens environmental health and disease prevention research center at dartmouth college and consumer reports found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the fda to set limits
the fda released some testing results in september and as of july is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation
it has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior
a world health organization advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of ppb for rice
in scientists assessed multiple preparation procedures of rice for their capacity to reduce arsenic content and preserve nutrients recommending a procedure involving parboiling and water absorption
arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms marine species in particular but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs
in polluted areas plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells
in polluted areas uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion is likely in poorly drained soils
arsenics toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic oxides for thiols
thiols in the form of cysteine residues and cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme a are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes
arsenic disrupts atp production through several mechanisms
at the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits lipoic acid which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase
by competing with phosphate arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energy linked reduction of nad mitochondrial respiration and atp synthesis
hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which it is speculated has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress
these metabolic interferences lead to death from multi system organ failure
the organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death not apoptosis since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur
occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds such as wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing
inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry
the conversion between as and as is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination
according to croal gralnick malasarn and newman understanding cl and the al o bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form al cl bonds instead all four trihalides are well known
unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride features six coordinate aluminium which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high heat of formation
each aluminium atom is surrounded by six fluorine atoms in a distorted octahedral arrangement with each fluorine atom being shared between the corners of two octahedra
such alf units also exist in complex fluorides such as cryolite naalf
alf melts at and is made by reaction of aluminium oxide with hydrogen fluoride gas at
with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower
the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral four coordinate aluminium centers
aluminium trichloride has a layered polymeric structure below its melting point of but transforms on melting to alcl dimers
at higher temperatures those increasingly dissociate into trigonal planar alcl monomers similar to the structure of bcl
aluminium tribromide and aluminium triiodide form alx dimers in all three phases and hence do not show such significant changes of properties upon phase change
these materials are prepared by treating aluminium with the halogen
the aluminium trihalides form many addition compounds or complexes their lewis acidic nature makes them useful as catalysts for the friedel crafts reactions
aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction such as in the manufacture of anthraquinones and styrene it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides
aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula alo commonly called alumina
it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum alumina there is also a alumina phase
its crystalline form corundum is very hard has a high melting point of has very low volatility is chemically inert and a good electrical insulator it is often used in abrasives as a refractory material and in ceramics as well as being the starting material for the electrolytic production of aluminium
sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals
the two main oxide hydroxides alo are boehmite and diaspore
there are three main trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure
many other intermediate and related structures are also known
most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base
heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum
these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful
some mixed oxide phases are also very useful such as spinel na alumina and tricalcium aluminate
the only stable chalcogenides under normal conditions are aluminium sulfide selenide and telluride
all three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about and quickly hydrolyze completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective hydrogen chalcogenide
as aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens these have four coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to wurtzite with two thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly or random fashion the sulfide also has a form related to alumina and an unusual high temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five coordination
four pnictides aluminium nitride aluminium phosphide aluminium arsenide and aluminium antimonide are known
they are all iii v semiconductors isoelectronic to silicon and germanium all of which but aln have the zinc blende structure
all four can be made by high temperature direct reaction of their component elements
c is made by heating a mixture of the elements above
the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers
it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane
the acetylide al is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium
aluminium nitride is the only nitride known for aluminium
unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centers
it can be made from the elements at
it is air stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity
aluminium phosphide is made similarly it hydrolyses to give phosphine aluminium alloys well with most other metals and over intermetallics with other metals are known
preparation involves heating fixed metals together in certain proportion followed by gradual cooling and annealing
bonding in them is predominantly metallic and the crystal structure primarily depends on efficiency of packing
there are few compounds with lower oxidation states
a few aluminium compounds exist alf alcl albr and ali exist in the gaseous phase when the respective trihalide is heated with aluminium and at cryogenic temperatures
a stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine ali
alo and als also exist but are very unstable
very simple aluminium compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants
for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra
more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula ral which contain an al al bond and where r is a large organic ligand
a variety of compounds of empirical formula alr and alrcl exist
the aluminium trialkyls and triaryls are reactive volatile and colorless liquids or low melting solids
they catch fire spontaneously in air and react with water thus necessitating precautions when handling them
they often form dimers unlike their boron analogues but this tendency diminishes for branched chain alkyls for example triisobutylaluminium exists as an equilibrium mixture of the monomer and dimer
these dimers such as trimethylaluminium usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some alkyl group bridging between both aluminium atoms
they are hard acids and react readily with ligands forming adducts
in industry they are mostly used in alkene insertion reactions as discovered by karl ziegler most importantly in growth reactions that form long chain unbranched primary alkenes and alcohols and in the low pressure polymerization of ethene and propene
there are also some heterocyclic and cluster organoaluminium compounds involving al n bonds
the industrially most important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry
it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride
the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane is not as important
it is a polymer with the formula n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula
aluminiums per particle abundance in the solar system is ppm
it is the twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic numbers after hydrogen and nitrogen
the only stable isotope of aluminium al is the eighteenth most abundant nucleus in the universe
it is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars that will later become type ii supernovas this fusion creates mg which upon capturing free protons and neutrons becomes aluminium
some smaller quantities of al are created in hydrogen burning shells of evolved stars where mg can capture free protons
essentially all aluminium now in existence is al
al was present in the early solar system with abundance of relative to al but its half life of years is too short for any original nuclei to survive al is therefore extinct
unlike for al hydrogen burning is the primary source of al with the nuclide emerging after a nucleus of mg catches a free proton
however the trace quantities of al that do exist are the most common gamma ray emitter in the interstellar gas if the original al were still present gamma ray maps of the milky way would be brighter
overall the earth is about aluminium by mass
aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earths crust than in the universe at large
this is because aluminium easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and stays in the earths crust while less reactive metals sink to the core
in the earths crust aluminium is the most abundant metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements
a large number of silicates in the earths crust contain aluminium
in contrast the earths mantle is only aluminium by mass
aluminium also occurs in seawater at a concentration of g kg
because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates
feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earths crust are aluminosilicates
aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise
impurities in alo such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively
native aluminium metal is extremely rare and can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes
native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea
it is possible that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahydroxoaluminate al
although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal
almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite x
bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions
in most bauxite was mined in australia china guinea and india
the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum
the first written record of alum made by greek historian herodotus dates back to the th century bce
the ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for city defense
after the crusades alum an indispensable good in the european fabric industry was a subject of international commerce it was imported to europe from the eastern mediterranean until the mid th century
the nature of alum remained unknown
around swiss physician paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum
in german doctor and chemist andreas libavius experimentally confirmed this
in german chemist friedrich hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth
in german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash
attempts to produce aluminium date back to
the first successful attempt however was completed in by danish physicist and chemist hans christian rsted
he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin
he presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in
in german chemist friedrich whler repeated rsteds experiments but did not identify any aluminium
he conducted a similar experiment in the same year by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium
in he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal
for many years thereafter whler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium
as whlers method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold
the first industrial production of aluminium was established in by french chemist henri etienne sainte claire deville and companions
deville had discovered that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which whler had used
even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample
because of its electricity conducting capacity aluminium was used as the cap of the washington monument completed in
the tallest building in the world at the time the non corroding metal cap was intended to serve as a lightning rod peak
the first industrial large scale production method was independently developed in by french engineer paul hroult and american engineer charles martin hall it is now known as the hall hroult process
the hall hroult process converts alumina into metal
austrian chemist carl joseph bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the bayer process in
modern production of the aluminium is based on the bayer and hall hroult processes
as large scale production caused aluminium prices to drop the metal became widely used in jewelry eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil and other everyday items in the s and early th century
aluminiums ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal with many uses at the time
during world war i major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes during world war ii demand by major governments for aviation was even higher
by the mid th century aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares
in production of aluminium surpassed that of copper historically second in production only to iron making it the most produced non ferrous metal
during the mid th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work and increasingly being used in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines
earths first artificial satellite launched in consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent
the aluminium can was invented in and employed as a storage for drinks in
throughout the th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in was metric tons the annual production first exceeded metric tons in tons in tons in
in the s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the london metal exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in
the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded metric tons in
the real price for aluminium declined from per metric ton in to in
extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies
however the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the s with the rise of energy cost
production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper
production costs in the late th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the united states dollar and alumina prices
the bric countries combined share in primary production and primary consumption grew substantially in the first decade of the st century
china is accumulating an especially large share of the worlds production thanks to an abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from in to in
in the united states western europe and japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging
in prices for industrial metals such as aluminium have soared to near record levels as energy shortages in china drive up costs for electricity
the names aluminium and aluminum are derived from the word alumine an obsolete term for alumina the primary naturally occurring oxide of aluminium
alumine was borrowed from french which in turn derived it from alumen the classical latin name for alum the mineral from which it was collected
the latin word alumen stems from the proto indo european root alu meaning bitter or beer
british chemist humphry davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to isolate the metal is credited as the person who named the element
the first name proposed for the metal to be isolated from alum was alumium which davy suggested in an article on his electrochemical research published in philosophical transactions of the royal society
it appeared that the name was created from the english word alum and the latin suffix ium but it was customary then to give elements names originating in latin so this name was not adopted universally
this name was criticized by contemporary chemists from france germany and sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated
the english name alum does not come directly from latin whereas alumine alumina obviously comes from the latin word alumen
one example was essai sur la nomenclature chimique written in french by a swedish chemist jns jacob berzelius in which the name aluminium is given to the element that would be synthesized from alum
a january summary of one of davys lectures at the royal society mentioned the name aluminium as a possibility
the next year davy published a chemistry textbook in which he used the spelling aluminum
both spellings have coexisted since
their usage is currently regional aluminum dominates in the united states and canada aluminium is prevalent in the rest of the english speaking world
in british scientist thomas young wrote an anonymous review of davys book in which he proposed the name aluminium instead of aluminum which he thought had a less classical sound
this name persisted although the spelling was occasionally used in britain the american scientific language used from the start
most scientists throughout the world used in the th century and it was entrenched in several other european languages such as french german and dutch
in an american lexicographer noah webster entered only the aluminum spelling in his american dictionary of the english language
in the s the spelling gained usage in the united states by the s it had become the more common spelling there outside science
in hall used the spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the spelling in all the patents he filed between and it is unknown whether this spelling was introduced by mistake or intentionally but hall preferred aluminum since its introduction because it resembled platinum the name of a prestigious metal
by both spellings had been common in the united states the spelling being slightly more common by the situation had reversed by aluminum had become twice as common as aluminium in the next decade the spelling dominated american usage
in the american chemical society adopted this spelling
the international union of pure and applied chemistry adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in
in they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the most recent edition of the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry also acknowledges this spelling
iupac official publications use the spelling as primary and they list both where it is appropriate
the production of aluminium starts with the extraction of bauxite rock from the ground
the bauxite is processed and transformed using the bayer process into alumina which is then processed using the hall hroult process resulting in the final aluminium
aluminium production is highly energy consuming and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive
production of one kilogram of aluminium requires kilograms of oil energy equivalent as compared to kilograms for steel and kilograms for plastic
as of the worlds largest smelters of aluminium are located in china india russia canada and the united arab emirates while china is by far the top producer of aluminium with a world share of fifty five percent
according to the international resource panels metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society is
much of this is in more developed countries rather than less developed countries
bauxite is converted to alumina by the bayer process
bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground
the resulting slurry is mixed with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into relatively insoluble compounds after this reaction the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point
it is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced
the bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded
the solution free of solids is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide this causes decomposition of the ions to aluminium hydroxide
after about half of aluminium has precipitated the mixture is sent to classifiers
small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents coarse particles are converted to alumina by heating the excess solution is removed by evaporation purified and recycled
the conversion of alumina to aluminium is achieved by the hall hroult process
in this energy intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten mixture of cryolite with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium
the liquid aluminium sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing
anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion and either bake at the process or are prebaked
the former also called sderberg anodes are less power efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power energy and labor to prebake the cathodes
carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash
despite carbons resistivity against corrosion it is still consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium
cathodes are made of anthracite high purity for them is not required because impurities leach only very slowly
the cathode is consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium
a cell is usually terminated after years following a failure of the cathode
the hall heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above
further purification can be done by the hoopes process
this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte
the resulting aluminium has a purity of
electric power represents about to of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter
aluminium production consumes roughly of electricity generated in the united states
because of this alternatives to the hall hroult process have been researched but none has turned out to be economically feasible
recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry
recycling was a low profile activity until the late s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness
recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part is lost as dross
an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below
white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially
the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material
this waste is difficult to manage
it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas
despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler in asphalt and concrete
the global production of aluminium in was million metric tons
it exceeded that of any other metal except iron
aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered
for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of to aluminium
the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight
aluminium both wrought and cast has been alloyed with manganese silicon magnesium copper and zinc among others
the great majority of aluminium oxide is converted to metallic aluminium
being a very hard material alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps
aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes eg the claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines
many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina
another principal use is as a drying agent or absorbent
several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application
aluminium sulfate is produced on the annual scale of several millions of metric tons
about two thirds is consumed in water treatment
the next major application is in the manufacture of paper
it is also used as a mordant in dyeing in pickling seeds deodorizing of mineral oils in leather tanning and in production of other aluminium compounds
two kinds of alum ammonium alum and potassium alum were formerly used as mordants and in leather tanning but their use has significantly declined following availability of high purity aluminium sulfate
anhydrous aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst in chemical and petrochemical industries the dyeing industry and in synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds
aluminium hydroxychlorides are used in purifying water in the paper industry and as antiperspirants
sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an accelerator of solidification of cement
despite its widespread occurrence in the earths crust aluminium has no known function in biology
at ph aluminium precipitates out of water as the hydroxide and is hence not available most elements behaving this way have no biological role or are toxic
aluminium sulfate has an ld of mg kg which corresponds to grams for a person
aluminium is classified as a non carcinogen by the united states department of health and human services
a review published in said that there was little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult and a multi element toxicology review was unable to find deleterious effects of aluminium consumed in amounts not greater than mg day per kg of body mass
most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream will be excreted via urine nevertheless some aluminium does pass the blood brain barrier and is lodged preferentially in the brains of alzheimers patients
evidence published in indicates that for alzheimers patients aluminium may act by electrostatically crosslinking proteins thus down regulating genes in the superior temporal gyrus
aluminium although rarely can cause vitamin d resistant osteomalacia erythropoietin resistant microcytic anemia and central nervous system alterations
people with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk
chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals such as iron or zinc sufficiently high doses can cause anemia
during the camelford water pollution incident people in camelford had their drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulfate for several weeks
a final report into the incident in concluded it was unlikely that this had caused long term health problems
aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of alzheimers disease but research into this for over years has found no good evidence of causal effect
aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory
in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier
a small percentage of people have contact allergies to aluminium and experience itchy red rashes headache muscle pain joint pain poor memory insomnia depression asthma irritable bowel syndrome or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium
exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis
fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard
food is the main source of aluminium
drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food however aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water
major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food drinking water and aluminium containing medications
dietary exposure in europeans averages to mg kg week but can be as high as mg kg week
higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners aluminium production workers and dialysis patients
consumption of antacids antiperspirants vaccines and cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure
consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues
in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium the only treatment is deferoxamine mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation
however this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels but also those of other metals such as copper or iron
high levels of aluminium occur near mining sites small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal fired power plants or incinerators
aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time
acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium however the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air
in water aluminium acts as a toxi agent on gill breathing animals such as fish when the water is acidic in which aluminium may precipitate on gills which causes loss of plasma and hemolymph ions leading to osmoregulatory failure
organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds even though this rarely happens in practice
aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils
although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph neutral soils in acid soils the concentration of toxic al cations increases and disturbs root growth and function
wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations
sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism
aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process
the major challenge is the greenhouse gas emissions
these gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing
the most potent of these gases are perfluorocarbons from the smelting process
released sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of acid rain
biodegradation of metallic aluminium is extremely rare most aluminium corroding organisms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium but instead produce corrosive wastes
the fungus geotrichum candidum can consume the aluminium in compact discs
the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium
advanced chemistry is a german hip hop group from heidelberg a scenic city in baden wrttemberg south germany
advanced chemistry was founded in by toni l linguist gee one dj mike md and mc torch
each member of the group holds german citizenship and toni l linguist and torch are of italian ghanaian and haitian backgrounds respectively
influenced by north american socially conscious rap and the native tongues movement advanced chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in german hip hop
they were one of the first groups to rap in german
furthermore their songs tackled controversial social and political issues distinguishing them from early german hip hop group die fantastischen vier which had a more light hearted playful party image
advanced chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in germany and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied a german identity can cause
the song fremd im eigenen land was released by advanced chemistry in november
the single became a staple in the german hip hop scene
it made a strong statement about the status of immigrants throughout germany as the group was composed of multi national and multi racial members
the video shows several members brandishing their german passports as a demonstration of their german citizenship to skeptical and unaccepting ethnic germans
this idea of national identity is important as many rap artists in germany have been of foreign origin
these so called gastarbeiter children saw breakdance graffiti rap music and hip hop culture as a means of expressing themselves
since the release of fremd im eigenen land many other german language rappers have also tried to confront anti immigrant ideas and develop themes of citizenship
however though many ethnic minority youth in germany find these german identity themes appealing others view the desire of immigrants to be seen as german negatively and they have actively sought to revive and recreate concepts of identity in connection to traditional ethnic origins
advanced chemistry helped to found the german chapter of the zulu nation
the rivalry between advanced chemistry and die fantastischen vier has served to highlight a dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming a part of the german soundscape
while die fantastischen vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an aesthetic art form advanced chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created
for advanced chemistry hip hop is a vehicle of general human emancipation
in their undertaking of social and political issues the band introduced the term afro german into the context of german hip hop and the theme of race is highlighted in much of their music
with the release of the single fremd im eigenen land advanced chemistry separated itself from the rest of the rap being produced in germany
this single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating us rap and addressed the current issues of the time
fremd im eigenen land which translates to foreign in my own country dealt with the widespread racism that non white german citizens faced
this change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of german identification with rap
the sound of fremd im eigenen land was influenced by the wall of noise created by public enemys producers the bomb squad
after the reunification of germany an abundance of anti immigrant sentiment emerged as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early s
advanced chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro multicultural society stance in their music
advanced chemistrys attitudes revolve around their attempts to create a distinct germanness in hip hop as opposed to imitating american hip hop as other groups had done
torch has said what the americans do is exotic for us because we dont live like they do
what they do seems to be more interesting and newer
but not for me
for me its more exciting to experience my fellow germans in new contexts
for me its interesting to see what the kids try to do thats different from what i know
advanced chemistry were the first to use the term afro german in a hip hop context
this was part of the pro immigrant political message they sent via their music
while advanced chemistrys use of the german language in their rap allows them to make claims to authenticity and true german heritage bolstering pro immigration sentiment their style can also be problematic for immigrant notions of any real ethnic roots
indeed part of the turkish ethnic minority of frankfurt views advanced chemistrys appeal to the german image as a symbolic betrayal of the right of ethnic minorities to roots or to any expression of cultural heritage
in this sense their rap represents a complex social discourse internal to the german soundscape in which they attempt to negotiate immigrant assimilation into a xenophobic german culture with the maintenance of their own separate cultural traditions
it is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure blooded german demographic that drive advanced chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their germanness as a group composed primarily of ethnic others
the response to this pseudo german authenticity can be seen in what andy bennett refers to as alternative forms of local hip hop culture which actively seek to rediscover and in many cases reconstruct notions of identity tied to cultural roots
these alternative local hip hop cultures include oriental hip hop the members of which cling to their turkish heritage and are confused by advanced chemistrys elicitation of a german identity politics to which they technically do not belong
this cultural binary illustrates that rap has taken different routes in germany and that even among an already isolated immigrant population there is still disunity and especially disagreement on the relative importance of assimilation versus cultural defiance
according to german hip hop enthusiast home advanced chemistry is part of a hip hop movement took a clear stance for the minorities and against the is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it not necessarily who penned the text
it is this distinction between producing a written work and producing the interpretation or meaning in a written work that both barthes and foucault are interested in
foucault warns of the risks of keeping the authors name in mind during interpretation because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation
literary critics barthes and foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work because of the complications inherent with a writers title of author
they warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice
instead readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as author
self publishing is a model where the author takes full responsibility and control of arranging financing editing printing and distribution of their own work
in other words the author also acts as the publisher of their work
with commissioned publishing the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses
the author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold
publishers at times reduced the risk of this type of arrangement by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold
in canada this practice occurred during the s but was not commonplace until the s
established and successful authors may receive advance payments set against future royalties but this is no longer common practice
most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher
under this arrangement the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication
the costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts
see compensation for more
vanity publishers normally charge a flat fee for arranging publication offer a platform for selling and then take a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book
the author receives the rest of the money made
most materials published this way are for niche groups and not for large audiences
vanity publishing or subsidy publishing is stigmatized in the professional world
in bill henderson defined vanity publishers as people who would publish anything for which an author will pay usually at a loss for the author and a nice profit for the publisher
in subsidy publishing the book sales are not the publishers main source of income but instead the fees that the authors are charged to initially produce the book are
because of this the vanity publishers need not invest in making books marketable as much as other publishers need to
this leads to low quality books being introduced to the market
the relationship between the author and the editor often the authors only liaison to the publishing company is typically characterized as the site of tension
for the author to reach their audience often through publication the work usually must attract the attention of the editor
the idea of the author as the sole meaning maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher to engage the audience in writing as a social act
pierre bourdieus essay the field of cultural production depicts the publishing industry as a space of literary or artistic position takings also called the field of struggles which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field
bourdieu claims that the field of position takings
is not the product of coherence seeking intention or objective consensus meaning that an industry characterized by position takings is not one of harmony and neutrality
in particular for the writer their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity
however it is the editor who has the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer
as cultural investors publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in cultural capital which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions
according to the studies of james curran the system of shared values among editors in britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors expectations removing the focus from the reader audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act
even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readerships reception
authors rely on advance fees royalty payments adaptation of work to a screenplay and fees collected from giving speeches
a standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties
usually an authors book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid
for example if an author is paid a modest advance of and their royalty rate is of a book priced at that is per book the book will need to sell copies before any further payment will be made
publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns
in some countries authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the elr and plr schemes in australia
under these schemes authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and or public libraries
these days many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements school visits residencies grants and teaching positions
ghostwriters technical writers and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales
in the year according to the us bureau of labor statistics nearly people worked in the country as authors making an average of per year
andrey andreyevich markov was a russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes
a primary subject of his research later became known as the markov chain
he was also a strong close to master level chess player
markov and his younger brother vladimir andreevich markov proved the markov brothers inequality
his son another andrey andreyevich markov was also a notable mathematician making contributions to constructive mathematics and recursive function theory
andrey markov was born on june in russia
he attended the st
petersburg grammar school where some teachers saw him as a rebellious student
in his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics
later in life he attended saint petersburg imperial university
among his teachers were yulian sokhotski konstantin posse yegor zolotarev pafnuty chebyshev aleksandr korkin mikhail okatov osip somov and nikolai budajev
he completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a mathematician
he later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies
in this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills
he figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in russian literature
he also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time
he died at age on july
in markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem about integration of differential equations by continued fractions with an application to the equation formula
during the following year he passed the candidates examinations and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturers position
in april markov defended his masters thesis on the binary square forms with positive determinant which was directed by aleksandr korkin and yegor zolotarev
four years later in he defended his doctoral thesis titled on certain applications of the algebraic continuous fractions
his pedagogical work began after the defense of his masters thesis in autumn
as a privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus
later he lectured alternately on introduction to analysis probability theory and the calculus of differences
from through he also lectured in differential calculus
one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis markov was appointed extraordinary professor and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences
in after the death of viktor bunyakovsky markov became an extraordinary member of the academy
his promotion to an ordinary professor of st
petersburg university followed in the fall of
in markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of chebyshev
in he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire which he did immediately
until however he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences
in connection with student riots in professors and lecturers of st
petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students
markov refused to accept this decree and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an agent of the governance
markov was removed from further teaching duties at st
petersburg university and hence he decided to retire from the university
markov was an atheist
in he responded to leo tolstoys excommunication from the russian orthodox church by requesting his own excommunication
the church complied with his request
in the council of st
petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university
markov was among them but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education
the affirmation only occurred four years later after the february revolution in
markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in
angst is fear or anxiety
the dictionary definition for angst is a feeling of anxiety apprehension or insecurity
the word angst was introduced into english from the danish norwegian and dutch word and the german word
it is attested since the th century in english translations of the works of sren kierkegaard and sigmund freud
it is used in english to describe an intense feeling of apprehension anxiety or inner turmoil
in other languages the derived words differ in meaning for example as in the french and
the word angst has existed in german since the th century from the proto indo european root restraint from which old high german developed
it is pre cognate with the latin tensity tightness and choking clogging compare to the ancient greek strangle
it entered english in the th century as a technical term used in psychiatry though earlier cognates existed such as
in existentialist philosophy the term angst carries a specific conceptual meaning
the use of the term was first attributed to danish philosopher sren kierkegaard
in the concept of anxiety kierkegaard used the word angest to describe a profound and deep seated condition
where non human animals are guided solely by instinct said kierkegaard human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying
it is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of ones life and the immense responsibility of having the power of choice over them
kierkegaards concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist philosophers who followed such as friedrich nietzsche jean paul sartre and martin heidegger each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways
while kierkegaards angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a religious personal belief system later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles cultural norms and existential despair
existential angst makes its appearance in classical musical composition in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war torn times
notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include gustav mahler richard strauss claude debussy jean sibelius arnold schoenberg alban berg francis poulenc dmitri shostakovich bla bartk and krzysztof penderecki
angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid to late s amid widespread concerns over international tensions and nuclear proliferation
jeff nuttalls book bomb culture traced angst in popular culture to hiroshima
dread was expressed in works of folk rock such as bob dylans masters of war and a hard rains a gonna fall
the term often makes an appearance in reference to punk rock grunge nu metal and works of emo where expressions of melancholy existential despair or nihilism predominate
anxiety is an emotion which is characterised by an unpleasant state of inner and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events
anxiety is different from fear in that fear is defined as the emotional response to a present threat whereas anxiety is the anticipation of a future one
it is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth somatic complaints and rumination
anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing
it is often accompanied by muscular tension restlessness fatigue inability to catch ones breath tightness in the abdominal region nausea and problems in concentration
anxiety is closely related to fear which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat anxiety involves the expectation of a future threat including dread
people facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past
the emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time periods in response to specific events and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders
the difference between anxiety disorder and anxiety is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety excessively or persistently during approximately months or even during shorter time periods in children
anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades
anxiety can also be experienced within other mental disorders eg obsessive compulsive disorder post traumatic stress disorder
anxiety is distinguished from fear which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat
anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of fight or flight responses defensive behavior or escape
there is a false presumption that often circulates that anxiety only occurs in situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable but this is not always so
david barlow defines anxiety as a future oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear
another description of anxiety is agony dread terror or even apprehension
in positive psychology anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills
fear and anxiety can be differentiated into four domains duration of emotional experience temporal focus specificity of the threat and motivated direction
fear is short lived present focused geared towards a specific threat and facilitating escape from threat
on the other hand anxiety is long acting future focused broadly focused towards a diffuse threat and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping
joseph e
ledoux and lisa feldman barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety
anxiety can be experienced with long drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life known as chronic anxiety or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic stressful panic attacks known as acute anxiety
symptoms of anxiety can range in number intensity and frequency depending on the person
however most people do not suffer from chronic anxiety
anxiety can induce several psychological pains or mental disorders and may lead to self harm or suicide for which dedicated hotlines exist
the behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past
other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns changes in habits increase or decrease in food intake and increased motor tension
the emotional effects of anxiety may include feelings of apprehension or dread trouble concentrating feeling tense or jumpy anticipating the worst irritability restlessness watching for signs of danger and a feeling of empty mindedness
as well as nightmares bad dreams obsessions about sensations dj vu a trapped in your mind feeling and feeling like everything is scary
it may include a vague experience and feeling of helplessness
the cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers such as an irrational fear of dying or having a heart attack when in reality all one is experiencing is mild chest pain for example
there are various types of anxiety
existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst an existential crisis or nihilistic feelings
people can also face mathematical anxiety somatic anxiety stage fright or test anxiety
social anxiety refers to a fear of rejection and negative evaluation by other people
the philosopher sren kierkegaard in the concept of anxiety described anxiety or dread associated with the dizziness of freedom and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing
in art and artist the psychologist otto rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative persons simultaneous fear of and desire for separation individuation and differentiation
the theologian paul tillich characterized existential anxiety as the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety ontic moral and spiritual
according to tillich the last of these three types of existential anxiety ie spiritual anxiety is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods
tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted as part of the human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences
in its pathological form spiritual anxiety may tend to drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by tradition and authority even though such undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of reality
according to viktor frankl the author of mans search for meaning when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers the most basic of all human wishes is to find a meaning of life to combat the trauma of nonbeing as death is near
depending on the source of the threat psychoanalytic theory distinguishes three types of anxiety realistic neurotic and moral
according to yerkes dodson law an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam performance or competitive event
however when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum the result is a decline in performance
test anxiety is the uneasiness apprehension or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam
students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following the association of grades with personal worth fear of embarrassment by a teacher fear of alienation from parents or friends time pressures or feeling a loss of control
sweating dizziness headaches racing heartbeats nausea fidgeting uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common
because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia
the dsm iv classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia
research indicates that test anxiety among us high school and college students has been rising since the late s
test anxiety remains a challenge for students regardless of age and has considerable physiological and psychological impacts
management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety
the routine practice of slow device guided breathing is a major component of behavioral treatments for anxiety conditions
performance anxiety and competitive anxiety happen when an individuals performance is measured against others
an important distinction between competitive and non competitive anxiety is that competitive anxiety makes people view their performance as a threat
as a result they experience a drop in their ordinary ability whether physical or mental due to that perceived stress
competitive anxiety is caused by a range of internal factors including high expectations outside pressure lack of experience and external factors like the location of a competition
it commonly occurs in those participating in high pressure activities like sports and debates
some common symptoms of competitive anxiety include muscle tension fatigue weakness sense of panic apprehensiveness and panic attacks
there are major theories of how anxiety affects performance drive theory inverted u theory reversal theory and the zone of optimal functioning theory
drive theory believes that anxiety is positive and performance improves proportionally to the level of anxiety
this theory is not well accepted
the inverted u theory is based on the idea that performance peaks at a moderate stress level
it is called inverted u theory because the graph that plots performance against anxiety looks like an inverted u
reversal theory suggests that performance increases in relation to the individuals interpretation of their arousal levels
if they believed their physical arousal level would help them their performance would increase if they didnt their performance would decrease
for example athletes were shown to worry more when focusing on results and perfection rather than the effort and growth involved
the zone of optimal functioning theory proposes that there is a zone where positive and negative emotions are in a balance which lead to feelings of dissociation and intense concentration optimizing the individuals performance levels
humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others
apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments
anxiety during social interactions particularly between strangers is common among young people
it may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia
stranger anxiety in small children is not considered a phobia
in adults an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage it is called social anxiety
according to cutting social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively
social anxiety varies in degree and severity
for some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether
those with this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety minimizing social interaction whenever possible
social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders including avoidant personality disorder
to the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members or people who share different group memberships
depending on the nature of the antecedent relations cognitions and situational factors intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety
this apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety
as is the case with the more generalized forms of social anxiety intergroup anxiety has behavioral cognitive and affective effects
for instance increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high
indeed such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory
additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations can be amplified during intergroup interaction
negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations but also avoidant or antagonistic behavior such as hostility
furthermore when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort in intragroup contexts levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation
anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term personality trait
trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations
a meta analysis showed that a high level of neuroticism is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders
such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious
personality can also be a trait leading to anxiety and depression and their persistence
through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature
anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is recognized as a problem for some individuals and for organizations
in capgemini wrote today were all faced with greater choice more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice
overthinking a choice is called analysis paralysis
in a decision context unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision making
there are primarily two forms of this anxiety type
the first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities
the second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities
panic disorder may share symptoms of stress and anxiety but it is actually very different
panic disorder is an anxiety disorder that occurs without any triggers
according to the us department of health and human services this disorder can be distinguished by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear
someone with panic disorder will eventually develop constant fear of another attack and as this progresses it will begin to affect daily functioning and an individuals general quality of life
it is reported by the cleveland clinic that panic disorder affects to percent of adult americans and can begin around the time of the teenage and early adult years
some symptoms include difficulty breathing chest pain dizziness trembling or shaking feeling faint nausea fear that you are losing control or are about to die
even though they have these symptoms during an attack the main symptom is the persistent fear of having future panic attacks
anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exaggerated feelings of anxiety and fear responses
anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events
these feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a fast heart rate and shakiness
there are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder specific phobia social anxiety disorder separation anxiety disorder agoraphobia panic disorder and selective mutism
the disorder differs by what results in the symptoms
people often have more than one anxiety disorder
anxiety disorders are caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors
to be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present for at least six months be more than would be expected for the situation and decrease a persons ability to function in their daily lives
other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism heart disease caffeine alcohol or cannabis use and withdrawal from certain drugs among others
without treatment anxiety disorders tend to remain
treatment may include lifestyle changes counselling and medications
counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioral therapy
medications such as antidepressants or beta blockers may improve symptoms
a review found that regular physical activity is effective for reducing anxiety
about of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between and are affected at some point in their life
they occur about twice as often in women than they do in men and generally begin before the age of
the most common anxiety disorders are specific phobias which affect nearly of people and social anxiety disorder which affects of people at some point in their life
they affect those between the ages of and the most and become less common after the age of
rates appear to be higher in the united states and europe
anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term trait
whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fears
anxiety disorders often occur with other mental health disorders particularly major depressive disorder bipolar disorder eating disorders or certain personality disorders
it also commonly occurs with personality traits such as neuroticism
this observed co occurrence is partly due to genetic and environmental influences shared between these traits and anxiety
it is common for those with obsessive compulsive disorder to experience anxiety
anxiety is also commonly found in those who experience panic disorders phobic anxiety disorders severe stress dissociative disorders somatoform disorders and some neurotic disorders
anxiety has also been linked to the experience of intrusive thoughts
studies have revealed that individuals who experience high levels of anxiety are highly vulnerable to the experience of intense intrusive thoughts or psychological disorders that are characterised by intrusive thoughts
anxiety disorders are partly genetic with twin studies suggesting genetic influence on individual differences in anxiety
environmental factors are also important
twin studies show that individual specific environments have a large influence on anxiety whereas shared environmental influences operate during childhood but decline through adolescence
specific measured environments that have been associated with anxiety include child abuse family history of mental health disorders and poverty
anxiety is also associated with drug use including alcohol caffeine and benzodiazepines which are often prescribed to treat anxiety
neural circuitry involving the amygdala which regulates emotions like anxiety and fear stimulating the hpa axis and sympathetic nervous system and hippocampus which is implicated in emotional memory along with the amygdala is thought to underlie anxiety
people who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala
some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system giving increased future anxiety but this does not appear to have been proven
research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive vigilant and fearful finds that their nucleus accumbens is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward
this suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people
as researchers note a sense of responsibility or self agency in a context of uncertainty drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents
the microbes of the gut can connect with the brain to affect anxiety
there are various pathways along which this communication can take place
one is through the major neurotransmitters
the gut microbes such as bifidobacterium and bacillus produce the neurotransmitters gaba and dopamine respectively
the neurotransmitters signal to the nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract and those signals will be carried to the brain through the vagus nerve or the spinal system
this is demonstrated by the fact that altering the microbiome has shown anxiety and depression reducing effects in mice but not in subjects without vagus nerves
another key pathway is the hpa axis as mentioned above
the microbes can control the levels of cytokines in the body and altering cytokine levels creates direct effects on areas of the brain such as the hypothalamus the area that triggers hpa axis activity
the hpa axis regulates production of cortisol a hormone that takes part in the bodys stress response
when hpa activity spikes cortisol levels increase processing and reducing anxiety in stressful situations
these pathways as well as the specific effects of individual taxa of microbes are not yet completely clear but the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain is undeniable as is the ability of these pathways to alter anxiety levels
with this communication comes the potential to treat
prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to reduce anxiety
for example experiments in which mice were given fructo and galacto oligosaccharide prebiotics and lactobacillus probiotics have both demonstrated a capability to reduce anxiety
in humans results are not as concrete but promising
genetics and family history may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation
estimates of genetic influence on anxiety based on studies of twins range from to depending on the specific type and age group under study
for example genetic differences account for about of variance in panic disorder and in generalized anxiety disorder
longitudinal twin studies have shown the moderate stability of anxiety from childhood through to adulthood is mainly influenced by stability in genetic influence
when investigating how anxiety is passed on from parents to children it is important to account for sharing of genes as well as environments for example using the intergenerational children of twins design
many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety
these investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters and hormones that are implicated in anxiety
none of these findings are well replicated with the possible exception of tmemd comt and mao a
the epigenetic signature of bdnf a gene that codes for a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor that is found in the brain has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity
and a receptor gene for bdnf called ntrk was associated with anxiety in a large genome wide investigation
the reason that most candidate gene findings have not replicated is that anxiety is a complex trait that is influenced by many genomic variants each of which has a small effect on its own
increasingly studies of anxiety are using a hypothesis free approach to look for parts of the genome that are implicated in anxiety using big enough samples to find associations with variants that have small effects
the largest explorations of the common genetic architecture of anxiety have been facilitated by the uk biobank the angst consortium and the crc fear anxiety and anxiety disorders
many medical conditions can cause anxiety
this includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe like copd and asthma and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death
conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety the same is true for some sexual dysfunctions
conditions that affect the face or the skin can cause social anxiety especially among adolescents and developmental disabilities often lead to social anxiety for children as well
life threatening conditions like cancer also cause anxiety
furthermore certain organic diseases may present with anxiety or symptoms that mimic anxiety
these disorders include certain endocrine diseases metabolic disorders deficiency states gastrointestinal diseases heart diseases blood diseases cerebral vascular accidents and brain degenerative diseases among others
several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety whether in intoxication withdrawal or as side effect
these include alcohol tobacco sedatives opioids stimulants hallucinogens and inhalants
while many often report self medicating anxiety with these substances improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short lived and tend to be exaggerated
acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria anxiety and irritability lasting up to weeks after the exposure
poor coping skills are associated with anxiety
anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the persons own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity
temperament and attitudes have been found to be risk factors for anxiety
cognitive distortions such as overgeneralizing catastrophizing mind reading emotional reasoning binocular trick and mental filter can result in anxiety
for example an overgeneralized belief that something bad always happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment
in addition those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events
together these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well as stressful events which in turn cause more anxiety
such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with cognitive therapy
psychodynamic theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing unconscious wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive defense mechanisms that develop to adapt to problems with early objects and empathic failures in childhood
for example persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individuals awareness
such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with psychodynamic therapy
while psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors
an evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats
this may cause false positive reactions but an individual with anxiety may also avoid real threats
this may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents
there is ample empirical evidence that anxiety can have adaptive value
within a school timid fish are more likely than bold fish to survive a predator
when people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes pet scans show increased blood flow in the amygdala
in these studies the participants also reported moderate anxiety
this might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors
social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma bullying early life experiences and parenting factors cultural factors and socioeconomics
a comprehensive systematic review of over studies showed that food insecurity in the united states is strongly associated with depression anxiety and sleep disorders
food insecure individuals had an almost fold risk increase of testing positive for anxiety when compared to food secure individuals
contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences
in particular learning mastery and instrumentality which includes such traits as self confidence self efficacy independence and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety
that is though gender differences in anxiety exist with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences
the first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause the recognition of which is essential in order to decide the correct treatment
anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder
cognitive behavioral therapy is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment
cbt appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet
while evidence for mental health apps is promising it is preliminary
anxiety often affects relationships and interpersonal psychotherapy addresses these issues by improving communication and relationship skills
psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to cbt or can be used alone
as a general rule most anxiety disorders respond well to first line agents
such drugs also used as anti depressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters
additionally benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder
benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating gaba and increasing its receptor binding
a third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists
this category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at hta receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor
other treatment options include pregabalin tricyclic antidepressants and moclobemide among others
anxiety is considered to be a serious psychiatric illness that has an unknown true pervasiveness due to affected individuals not asking for proper treatment or aid and due to professionals missing the diagnosis
the above risk factors give natural avenues for prevention
a review found that psychological or educational interventions have a small yet statistically significant benefit for the prevention of anxiety in varied population types
anxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance decreased gaba ergic tone allelic polymorphism of the catechol o methyltransferase gene increased adenosine receptor function increased cortisol
in the central nervous system the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine serotonin dopamine and gamma aminobutyric acid
other neurotransmitters and peptides such as corticotropin releasing factor may be involved
peripherally the autonomic nervous system especially the sympathetic nervous system mediates many of the symptoms
increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type a receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder
the amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders
anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with expansion of dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons
sk potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization
alan alexander milne was an english writer best known for his books about the teddy bear winnie the pooh as well as for childrens poetry
milne was primarily a playwright before the huge success of winnie the pooh overshadowed all his previous work

during world war ii milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow english writer p
wodehouse who was captured at his country home in france by the nazis and imprisoned for a year
wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment which were broadcast from berlin
although the light hearted broadcasts made fun of the germans milne accused wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his countrys enemy
wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend by creating fatuous parodies of the christopher robin poems in some of his later stories and claiming that milne was probably jealous of all other writers

the fictional hundred acre wood of the pooh stories derives from five hundred acre wood in ashdown forest in east sussex south east england where the pooh stories were set
milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at cotchford farm and took his son walking there
shepard drew on the landscapes of ashdown forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the pooh books
the adult christopher robin commented poohs forest and ashdown forest are identical
popular tourist locations at ashdown forest include galleons lap the enchanted place the heffalump trap and lone pine eeyores sad and gloomy place and the wooden pooh bridge where pooh and piglet invented poohsticks
not yet known as pooh he made his first appearance in a poem teddy bear published in punch magazine in february and republished that year in when we were very young
pooh first appeared in the london evening news on christmas eve in a story called the wrong sort of bees
winnie the pooh was published in followed by the house at pooh corner in
a second collection of nursery rhymes now we are six was published in
all four books were illustrated by e
milne also published four plays in this period
he also gallantly stepped forward to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising p
wodehouses a damsel in distress
the world of pooh won the lewis carroll shelf award in
the success of his childrens books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to milne whose self avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had until then found a ready audience for each change of direction he had freed pre war punch from its ponderous facetiousness he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright on both sides of the atlantic he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in the red house mystery
but once milne had in his own words said goodbye to all that in words he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality given that one of the sources of inspiration his son was growing older
another reason milne stopped writing childrens books and especially about winnie the pooh was that he felt amazement and disgust over the immense fame his son was exposed to and said that i feel that the legal christopher robin has already had more publicity than i want for him
i do not want cr milne to ever wish that his name were charles robert
in his literary home punch where the when we were very young verses had first appeared methuen continued to publish whatever milne wrote including the long poem the norman church and an assembly of articles entitled year in year out
in milne adapted kenneth grahames novel the wind in the willows for the stage as toad of toad hall
the title was an implicit admission that such chapters as chapter the piper at the gates of dawn could not survive translation to the theatre
a special introduction written by milne is included in some editions of grahames novel
it was first performed at the playhouse theatre liverpool on december before it made its west end debut the following year at the lyric theatre on december
the play was revived in the west end from to and since the s there have been west end revivals during the christmas season actors who have performed in the play include judi dench and ian mckellen
milne and his wife became estranged from their son who came to resent what he saw as his fathers exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye
christophers marriage to his first cousin lesley de slincourt distanced him still further from his parents lesleys father and christophers mother had not spoken to each other for years
milne died at his home in hartfield sussex on january nearly two weeks after his th birthday
a memorial service took place on february at all hallows by the tower church in london
the rights to a
milnes pooh books were left to four beneficiaries his family the royal literary fund westminster school and the garrick club
after milnes death in thirteen days after his th birthday his widow sold her rights to the pooh characters to stephen slesinger whose widow sold the rights after slesingers death to the walt disney company which has made many pooh cartoon movies a disney channel television show as well as pooh related merchandise
in the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the disney corporation for m
previously disney had been paying twice yearly royalties to these beneficiaries
the estate of e
shepard also received a sum in the deal
the uk copyright on the text of the original winnie the pooh books expires on january at the beginning of the year after the th anniversary of the authors death and has already expired in those countries with a pma rule
this applies to all of milnes works except those first published posthumously
the illustrations in the pooh books will remain under copyright until the same amount of time has passed after the illustrators death in the uk this will be on january
in the us copyright will not expire until years after publication for each of milnes books first published before but this includes the illustrations
in a collection of original illustrations featuring winnie the pooh and his animal friends sold for more than million at auction in sothebys london
forbes magazine ranked winnie the pooh the most valuable fictional character in winnie the pooh merchandising products alone had annual sales of more than billion
in winnie the pooh generated billion a figure surpassed only by mickey mouse
a memorial plaque in ashdown forest unveiled by christopher robin in commemorates the work of a
milne and shepard in creating the world of pooh
the inscription states they captured the magic of ashdown forest and gave it to the world
milne once wrote of ashdown forest in that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing
in winnie the pooh was ranked number on the bbcs the big read poll which determined the uks best loved novels
in winnie the pooh received a star on the hollywood walk of fame marking the th birthday of milnes creation
marking the th anniversary of milnes creation of the character and the th birthday of queen elizabeth ii winnie the pooh meets the queen sees pooh meet the queen at buckingham palace
the illustrated and audio adventure is narrated by the actor jim broadbent
also in a new character a penguin was unveiled in the best bear in all the world which was inspired by a long lost photograph of milne and his son christopher with a toy penguin
an exhibition entitled appeared at the victoria and albert museum in london from december to april
the composer harold fraser simson a near neighbour produced six books of milne songs between and
the poems have been parodied many times including with the books when we were rather older and now we are sixty
the film the kings breakfast was based on milnes poem of the same name
milne has been portrayed in television and film
domhnall gleeson plays him in goodbye christopher robin a biographical drama film
in the fantasy film christopher robin an extension of the disney winnie the pooh franchise tristan sturrock plays milne and filming took place at ashdown forest
an elementary school in houston texas operated by the houston independent school district is named after milne
the school a

the original manuscripts for winnie the pooh and the house at pooh corner are archived at trinity college library cambridge
the bulk of a
milnes papers are housed at the harry ransom center at the university of texas at austin
the collection established at the centre in consists of manuscript drafts and fragments for over of milnes works as well as correspondence legal documents genealogical records and some personal effects
the library division holds several books formerly belonging to milne and his wife dorothy
the center also has small collections of correspondence from christopher robin milne and milnes frequent illustrator e
milne did not speak out much on the subject of religion although he used religious terms to explain his decision while remaining a pacifist to join the british home guard
he wrote in fighting hitler we are truly fighting the devil the anti christ

asociacin alumni usually just alumni is an argentine rugby union club located in tortuguitas greater buenos aires
the senior squad currently competes at top the first division of the unin de rugby de buenos aires league system
the club has ties with former football club alumni because both were established by buenos aires english high school students
the first club with the name alumni played association football having been found in by students of buenos aires english high school along with director alexander watson hutton
originally under the name english high school ac the team would be later obliged by the association to change its name therefore alumni was chosen following a proposal by carlos bowers a former student of the school
alumni was the most successful team during the first years of argentine football winning of league championships contested
alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country
alumni was reorganised in in order to encourage people to practise all kinds of sports specially football
this was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just as a football team as lomas belgrano and quilmes had successfully done in the past but the efforts were not enough
alumni played its last game in and was definitely dissolved on april
in two guards of the baehs daniel ginhson and guillermo cubelli supported by the schools alumni and fathers of the students decided to establish a club focused on rugby union exclusively
former players of alumni football club and descendants of other players already dead gave their permission to use the name alumni
on december in a meeting presided by carlos bowers himself the club was officially established under the name asociacin juvenil alumni also adopting the same colors as its predecessor
the team achieved good results and in the club presented a team that won the third division of the buenos aires league reaching the second division
since then alumni has played at the highest level of argentine rugby and its rivalry with belgrano athletic club is one of the fiercest local derbies in buenos aires
alumni would later climb up to the first division winning titles consecutive between and and the other in
in alumni won its first nacional de clubes title defeating jockey club de rosario in the final
an axiom postulate or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments
the word comes from the ancient greek word meaning that which is thought worthy or fit or that which commends itself as evident
the precise definition varies across fields of study
in classic philosophy an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well established that it is accepted without controversy or question
in modern logic an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning
in mathematics an axiom may be a logical axiom or a non logical axiom
logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form implies a while non logical axioms are substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory for example a a in integer arithmetic
non logical axioms may also be called postulates assumptions or proper axioms
in most cases a non logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory and might or might not be self evident in nature
to axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small well understood set of sentences and there are typically many ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain
any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived
whether it is meaningful for an axiom to be true is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics
the word axiom comes from the greek word a verbal noun from the verb meaning to deem worthy but also to require which in turn comes from meaning being in balance and hence having value worthy proper
among the ancient greek philosophers and mathematicians axioms were taken to be immediately evident propositions foundational and common to many fields of investigation and self evidently true without any further argument or proof
the root meaning of the word postulate is to demand for instance euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done
ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates
while commenting on euclids books proclus remarks that geminus held that this postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom since it does not like the first three postulates assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property
boethius translated postulate as petitio and called the axioms notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept
the logico deductive method whereby conclusions follow from premises through the application of sound arguments was developed by the ancient greeks and has become the core principle of modern mathematics
tautologies excluded nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed
axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge
they are accepted without demonstration
all other assertions must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions
however the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician than they did for aristotle and euclid
the ancient greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts
as such they developed and used the logico deductive method as a means of avoiding error and for structuring and communicating knowledge
aristotles posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view
an axiom in classical terminology referred to a self evident assumption common to many branches of science
a good example would be the assertion that when an equal amount is taken from equals an equal amount results
at the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses that were accepted without proof
such a hypothesis was termed a postulate
while the axioms were common to many sciences the postulates of each particular science were different
their validity had to be established by means of real world experience
aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates
the classical approach is well illustrated by euclids elements where a list of postulates is given followed by a list of common notions
a lesson learned by mathematics in the last years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions and definitions
one must concede the need for primitive notions or undefined terms or concepts in any study
such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general capable of multiple different meanings and therefore useful in multiple contexts
alessandro padoa mario pieri and giuseppe peano were pioneers in this movement
structuralist mathematics goes further and develops theories and axioms without any particular application in mind
the distinction between an axiom and a postulate disappears
the postulates of euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts
the truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses
however by throwing out euclids fifth postulate one can get theories that have meaning in wider contexts
as such one must simply be prepared to use labels such as line and parallel with greater flexibility
the development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that it is useful to regard postulates as purely formal statements and not as facts based on experience
when mathematicians employ the field axioms the intentions are even more abstract
the propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application the mathematician now works in complete abstraction
there are many examples of fields field theory gives correct knowledge about them all
it is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are propositions that are regarded as true without proof
rather the field axioms are a set of constraints
if any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system
modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of logic
frege russell poincar hilbert and gdel are some of the key figures in this development
another lesson learned in modern mathematics is to examine purported proofs carefully for hidden assumptions
in the modern understanding a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well defined rules
in this view logic becomes just another formal system
a set of axioms should be consistent it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axioms
a set of axioms should also be non redundant an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom
it was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics perhaps all of mathematics could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms
an early success of the formalist program was hilberts formalization of euclidean geometry and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms
in a wider context there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on cantors set theory
here the emergence of russells paradox and similar antinomies of nave set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent
the formalist project suffered a setback a century ago when gdel showed that it is possible for any sufficiently large set of axioms to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms
as a corollary gdel proved that the consistency of a theory like peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory
it is reasonable to believe in the consistency of peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system
however at present there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern zermelo fraenkel axioms for set theory
furthermore using techniques of forcing one can show that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the zermelo fraenkel axioms
thus even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics
experimental sciences as opposed to mathematics and logic also have general founding assertions from which a deductive reasoning can be built so as to express propositions that predict properties either still general or much more specialized to a specific experimental context
for instance newtons laws in classical mechanics maxwells equations in classical electromagnetism einsteins equation in general relativity mendels laws of genetics darwins natural selection law etc
these founding assertions are usually called principles or postulates so as to distinguish from mathematical axioms
as a matter of facts the role of axioms in mathematics and postulates in experimental sciences is different
in mathematics one neither proves nor disproves an axiom
a set of mathematical axioms gives a set of rules that fix a conceptual realm in which the theorems logically follow
in contrast in experimental sciences a set of postulates shall allow deducing results that match or do not match experimental results
if postulates do not allow deducing experimental predictions they do not set a scientific conceptual framework and have to be completed or made more accurate
if the postulates allow deducing predictions of experimental results the comparison with experiments allows falsifying the theory that the postulates install
a theory is considered valid as long as it has not been falsified
now the transition between the mathematical axioms and scientific postulates is always slightly blurred especially in physics
this is due to the heavy use of mathematical tools to support the physical theories
for instance the introduction of newtons laws rarely establishes as a prerequisite neither euclidean geometry or differential calculus that they imply
it became more apparent when albert einstein first introduced special relativity where the invariant quantity is no more the euclidean length formula but the minkowski spacetime interval formula and then general relativity where flat minkowskian geometry is replaced with pseudo riemannian geometry on curved manifolds
in quantum physics two sets of postulates have coexisted for some time which provide a very nice example of falsification
the copenhagen school developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical formalism that involves the description of quantum system by vectors in a separable hilbert space and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this hilbert space
this approach is fully falsifiable and has so far produced the most accurate predictions in physics
but it has the unsatisfactory aspect of not allowing answers to questions one would naturally ask
for this reason another hidden variables approach was developed for some time by albert einstein erwin schrdinger david bohm
it was created so as to try to give deterministic explanation to phenomena such as entanglement
this approach assumed that the copenhagen school description was not complete and postulated that some yet unknown variable was to be added to the theory so as to allow answering some of the questions it does not answer
taking this ideas seriously john bell derived in a prediction that would lead to different experimental results in the copenhagen and the hidden variable case
the experiment was conducted first by alain aspect in the early s and the result excluded the simple hidden variable approach
this does not mean that the conceptual framework of quantum physics can be considered as complete now since some open questions still exist
in the field of mathematical logic a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms logical and non logical
these are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid that is formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values
usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense
each of these patterns is an axiom schema a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms
for example if formula formula and formula are propositional variables then formula and formula are both instances of axiom schema and hence are axioms
it can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and modus ponens one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus
it can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens
other axiom schemata involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed
these axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus
axiom of equalitylet formula be a first order language
for each variable formula the below formula is universally valid
formula this means that for any variable symbol formula the formula formula can be regarded as an axiom
also in this example for this not to fall into vagueness and a never ending series of primitive notions either a precise notion of what we mean by formula has to be well established first or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol formula has to be enforced only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols and mathematical logic does indeed do that
axiom scheme for universal instantiationgiven a formula formula in a first order language formula a variable formula and a term formula that is substitutable for formula in formula the below formula is universally valid
formula where the symbol formula stands for the formula formula with the term formula substituted for formula
in informal terms this example allows us to state that if we know that a certain property formula holds for every formula and that formula stands for a particular object in our structure then we should be able to claim formula
again we are claiming that the formula formula is valid that is we must be able to give a proof of this fact or more properly speaking a metaproof
these examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself
aside from this we can also have existential generalization axiom scheme for existential generalization
given a formula formula in a first order language formula a variable formula and a term formula that is substitutable for formula in formula the below formula is universally valid
formula non logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory specific assumptions
reasoning about two different structures for example the natural numbers and the integers may involve the same logical axioms the non logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure
thus non logical axioms unlike logical axioms are not tautologies
another name for a non logical axiom is postulate
almost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non logical axioms and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas
non logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse
this does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense
for example in some groups the group operation is commutative and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom but without this axiom we can do quite well developing group theory and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non commutative groups
thus an axiom is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system
this section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non logical axioms
a rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms
basic theories such as arithmetic real analysis and complex analysis are often introduced non axiomatically but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of zermelo fraenkel set theory with choice abbreviated zfc or some very similar system of axiomatic set theory like von neumann bernays gdel set theory a conservative extension of zfc
sometimes slightly stronger theories such as morse kelley set theory or set theory with a strongly inaccessible cardinal allowing the use of a grothendieck universe is used but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than zfc such as second order arithmetic
the study of topology in mathematics extends all over through point set topology algebraic topology differential topology and all the related paraphernalia such as homology theory homotopy theory
the development of abstract algebra brought with itself group theory rings fields and galois theory
this list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics including measure theory ergodic theory probability representation theory and differential geometry
the peano axioms are the most widely used axiomatization of first order arithmetic
they are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed gdel to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem
the standard structure is formula where formula is the set of natural numbers formula is the successor function and formula is naturally interpreted as the number
probably the oldest and most famous list of axioms are the euclids postulates of plane geometry
the axioms are referred to as because for nearly two millennia the fifth postulate was suspected of being derivable from the first four
ultimately the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four
one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists or that infinitely many exist
this choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to exactly degrees or less respectively and are known as euclidean and hyperbolic geometries
if one also removes the second postulate then elliptic geometry arises where there is no parallel through a point outside a line and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than degrees
the objectives of the study are within the domain of real numbers
the real numbers are uniquely picked out by the properties of a dedekind complete ordered field meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound
however expressing these properties as axioms requires the use of second order logic
the lwenheim skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first order logic any axiom system for the reals admits other models including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger
some of the latter are studied in non standard analysis
a deductive system consists of a set formula of logical axioms a set formula of non logical axioms and a set formula of rules of inference
a desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete
a system is said to be complete if for all formulas formula formula that is for any statement that is a logical consequence of formula there actually exists a deduction of the statement from formula
this is sometimes expressed as everything that is true is provable but it must be understood that true here means made true by the set of axioms and not for example true in the intended interpretation
gdels completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system
note that completeness has a different meaning here than it does in the context of gdels first incompleteness theorem which states that no recursive consistent set of non logical axioms formula of the theory of arithmetic is complete in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement formula such that neither formula nor formula can be proved from the given set of axioms
there is thus on the one hand the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non logical axioms
the completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem despite their names do not contradict one another
early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space and obviously there could only be one such model
the idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the th century and the developers of systems such as boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic
galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted
ultimately the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and modern algebra was born
in the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas as long as they are not known to be inconsistent
alpha is the first letter of the greek alphabet
in the system of greek numerals it has a value of one
alpha is derived from the phoenician letter aleph which is the west semitic word for ox
letters that arose from alpha include the latin letter a and the cyrillic letter
in ancient greek alpha was pronounced and could be either phonemically long
where there is ambiguity long and short alpha are sometimes written with a macron and breve today
in modern greek vowel length has been lost and all instances of alpha simply represent the open front unrounded vowel
in the polytonic orthography of greek alpha like other vowel letters can occur with several diacritic marks any of three accent symbols and either of two breathing marks as well as combinations of these
it can also combine with the iota subscript
in the attic ionic dialect of ancient greek long alpha fronted to
in ionic the shift took place in all positions
in attic the shift did not take place after epsilon iota and rho
in doric and aeolic long alpha is preserved in all positions
privative a is the ancient greek prefix or added to words to negate them
it originates from the proto indo european and is cognate with english un
copulative a is the greek prefix or
it comes from proto indo european
the letter alpha represents various concepts in physics and chemistry including alpha radiation angular acceleration alpha particles alpha carbon and strength of electromagnetic interaction
alpha also stands for thermal expansion coefficient of a compound in physical chemistry
it is also commonly used in mathematics in algebraic solutions representing quantities such as angles
furthermore in mathematics the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a normal curve in statistics to denote significance level when proving null and alternative hypotheses
in ethology it is used to name the dominant individual in a group of animals
in aerodynamics the letter is used as a symbol for the angle of attack of an aircraft and the word alpha is used as a synonym for this property
in mathematical logic is sometimes used as a placeholder for ordinal numbers
the proportionality operator is sometimes mistaken for alpha
the uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase latin a
in the international phonetic alphabet the letter which looks similar to the lower case alpha represents the open back unrounded vowel
the phoenician alphabet was adopted for greek in the early th century bc perhaps in euboea
the majority of the letters of the phoenician alphabet were adopted into greek with much the same sounds as they had had in phoenician but leph the phoenician letter representing the glottal stop was adopted as representing the vowel similarly h and ayin are phoenician consonants that became greek vowels epsilon and omicron respectively
plutarch in moralia presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet
ammonius asks plutarch what he being a boeotian has to say for cadmus the phoenician who reputedly settled in thebes and introduced the alphabet to greece placing alpha first because it is the phoenician name for ox which unlike hesiod the phoenicians considered not the second or third but the first of all necessities
nothing at all plutarch replied
he then added that he would rather be assisted by lamprias his own grandfather than by dionysus grandfather ie cadmus
for lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is alpha because it is very plain and simple the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue and therefore this is the first sound that children make
according to plutarchs natural order of attribution of the vowels to the planets alpha was connected with the moon
as the first letter of the alphabet alpha as a greek numeral came to represent the number
therefore alpha both as a symbol and term is used to refer to the first or primary or principal occurrence or status of a thing
the new testament has god declaring himself to be the alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
consequently the term alpha has also come to be used to denote primary position in social hierarchy examples being the concept of dominant alpha members in groups of animals

alvin eugene toffler was an american writer futurist and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies including the digital revolution and the communication revolution with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide
he is regarded as one of the worlds outstanding futurists
toffler was an associate editor of fortune magazine
in his early works he focused on technology and its impact which he termed information overload
in his first major book about the future future shock became a worldwide best seller and has sold over million copies
he and his wife heidi toffler who collaborated with him for most of his writings moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best selling book the third wave in
in it he foresaw such technological advances as cloning personal computers the internet cable television and mobile communication
his later focus via their other best seller powershift was on the increasing power of st century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies
he founded toffler associates a management consulting company and was a visiting scholar at the russell sage foundation visiting professor at cornell university faculty member of the new school for social research a white house correspondent and a business consultant
tofflers ideas and writings were a significant influence on the thinking of business and government leaders worldwide including chinas zhao ziyang and aol founder steve case
alvin toffler was born on october in new york city and raised in brooklyn
he was the son of rose and sam toffler a furrier both polish jews who had migrated to america
he had one younger sister
he was inspired to become a writer at the age of by his aunt and uncle who lived with the tofflers
they were depression era literary intellectuals toffler said and they always talked about exciting ideas
toffler graduated from new york university in as an english major though by his own account he was more focused on political activism than grades
he met his future wife adelaide elizabeth farrell when she was starting a graduate course in linguistics
being radical students they decided against further graduate work and moved to cleveland ohio where they married on april
seeking experiences to write about alvin and heidi toffler spent the next five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work
he compared his own desire for experience to other writers such as jack london who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas and john steinbeck who went to pick grapes with migrant workers
in their first factory jobs heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked
alvin became a millwright and welder
in the evenings alvin would write poetry and fiction but discovered he was proficient at neither
his hands on practical labor experience helped alvin toffler land a position at a union backed newspaper a transfer to its washington bureau in then three years as a white house correspondent covering congress and the white house for a pennsylvania daily newspaper
they returned to new york city in when fortune magazine invited alvin to become its labor columnist later having him write about business and management
after leaving fortune magazine in toffler began a freelance career writing long form articles for scholarly journals and magazines
his playboy interviews with russian novelist vladimir nabokov and ayn rand were considered among the magazines best
his interview with rand was the first time the magazine had given such a platform to a female intellectual which as one commentator said the real bird of paradise toffler captured for playboy in was ayn rand
toffler was hired by ibm to conduct research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers leading to his contact with the earliest computer gurus and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents
xerox invited him to write about its research laboratory and att consulted him for strategic advice
this att work led to a study of telecommunications which advised the companys top management to break up the company more than a decade before the government forced att to break up
in the mid s the tofflers began five years of research on what would become future shock published in
it has sold over million copies worldwide according to the new york times or over million copies according to the tofflers web site
toffler coined the term future shock to refer to what happens to a society when change happens too fast which results in social confusion and normal decision making processes breaking down
the book has never been out of print and has been translated into dozens of languages
he continued the theme in the third wave in
while he describes the first and second waves as the agricultural and industrial revolutions the third wave a phrase he coined represents the current information computer based revolution
he forecast the spread of the internet and email interactive media cable television cloning and other digital advancements
he claimed that one of the side effects of the digital age has been information overload another term he coined
in he wrote powershift also with the help of his wife heidi
in with american business consultant tom johnson they co founded toffler associates an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the tofflers had written on
the firm worked with businesses ngos and governments in the united states south korea mexico brazil singapore australia and other countries
during this period in his career toffler lectured worldwide taught at several schools and met world leaders such as mikhail gorbachev along with key executives and military officials
toffler stated many of his ideas during an interview with the australian broadcasting corporation in
society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest he said
society needs people who work in hospitals
society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive theyre emotional theyre affectional
you cant run the society on data and computers alone
his opinions about the future of education many of which were in future shock have often been quoted
an often misattributed quote however is that of psychologist herbert gerjuoy tomorrows illiterate will not be the man who cant read he will be the man who has not learned how to learn
early in his career after traveling to other countries he became aware of the new and myriad inputs that visitors received from these other cultures
he explained during an interview that some visitors would become truly disoriented and upset by the strange environment which he described as a reaction to culture shock
from that issue he foresaw another problem for the future when a culturally new environment comes to you
and comes to you rapidly
that kind of sudden cultural change within ones own country which he felt many would not understand would lead to a similar reaction one of future shock which he wrote about in his book by that title
toffler writes in the third wave toffler describes three types of societies based on the concept of waves each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside
he describes the first wave as the society after agrarian revolution and replaced the first hunter gatherer cultures
the second wave he labels society during the industrial revolution
that period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional nuclear family and initiated a factory like education system and the growth of the corporation
toffler said the third wave was a term he coined to describe the post industrial society which began in the late s
his description of this period dovetails with other futurist writers who also wrote about the information age space age electronic era global village terms which highlighted a scientific technological revolution
the tofflers claimed to have predicted a number of geopolitical events such as the collapse of the soviet union the fall of the berlin wall and the future economic growth in the asia pacific region
toffler often visited with dignitaries in asia including chinas zhao ziyang singapores lee kuan yew and south koreas kim dae jung all of whom were influenced by his views as asias emerging markets increased in global significance during the s and s
although they had originally censored some of his books and ideas chinas government cited him along with franklin roosevelt and bill gates as being among the westerners who had most influenced their country
the third wave along with a video documentary based on it became best sellers in china and were widely distributed to schools
the videos success inspired the marketing of videos on related themes in the late s by infowars whose name is derived from the term coined by toffler in the book
tofflers influence on asian thinkers was summed up in an article in daedalus published by the american academy of arts sciences us house speaker newt gingrich publicly lauded his ideas about the future and urged members of congress to read tofflers book creating a new civilization
others such as aol founder steve case cited tofflers the third wave as a formative influence on his thinking which inspired him to write the third wave an entrepreneurs vision of the future in
case said that toffler was a real pioneer in helping people companies and even countries lean into the future
in ted turner founded cnn which he said was inspired by tofflers forecasting the end of the dominance of the three main television networks
turners company turner broadcasting published tofflers creating a new civilization in
shortly after the book was released the former soviet president mikhail gorbachev hosted the global governance conference in san francisco with the theme toward a new civilization which was attended by dozens of world figures including the tofflers george h
bush margaret thatcher carl sagan abba eban and turner with his then wife actress jane fonda
mexican billionaire carlos slim was influenced by his works and became a friend of the writer
global marketer jd power also said he was inspired by tofflers works
since the s people had tried to make sense out of the effect of new technologies and social change a problem which made tofflers writings widely influential beyond the confines of scientific economic and public policy
his works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms usually with the same argumentation used against futurology that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible
techno music pioneer juan atkins cites tofflers phrase techno rebels in the third wave as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create musician curtis mayfield released a disco song called future shock later covered in an electro version by herbie hancock
science fiction author john brunner wrote the shockwave rider from the concept of future shock
the nightclub toffler in rotterdam is named after him
in the song victoria by the exponents the protagonists daily routine and cultural interests are described shes up in time to watch the soap operas reads cosmopolitan and alvin toffler
accenture the management consultancy firm identified toffler in as being among the most influential voices in business leaders along with bill gates and peter drucker
toffler has also been described in a financial times interview as the worlds most famous futurologist
in the peoples daily classed him among the foreigners who shaped modern china which one us newspaper notes made him a guru of sorts to world statesmen
chinese premier and general secretary zhao ziyang was greatly influenced by toffler
he convened conferences to discuss the third wave in the early s and in the book was the no
best seller in china
author mark satin characterizes toffler as an important early influence on radical centrist political thought
newt gingrich became close to the tofflers in the s and said the third wave had immensely influenced his own thinking and was one of the great seminal works of our time
toffler has received several prestigious prizes and awards including the mckinsey foundation book award for contributions to management literature officier de lordre des arts et lettres and appointments including fellow of the american association for the advancement of science and the international institute for strategic studies
in alvin and heidi toffler were recipients of brown universitys independent award

it ran for issues before reverting to the titles overall issue number with in
the series ran essentially continuously over the first two volumes from until its landmark th issue at the end of when it was replaced by the superior spider man as part of the marvel now relaunch of marvels comic lines
the title was occasionally published biweekly during the first two volumes and was published three times a month from to
after the relaunch of action comics and detective comics the amazing spider man briefly became the highest numbered active american comic book
the amazing spider man returned with volume in april following the conclusion of the superior spider man story arc after issues
in late the series was relaunched with a fourth volume following the secret wars event
after years the volume was once again relaunched as part of marvel legacy returning to the overall legacy numbering with issue no

for the first time although the issue numbers were again restarted from the issues also bore the overall legacy issue number
a sixth volume commenced in april to celebrate spider mans th anniversary
since the second volume the title has had various release schedules including monthly and bi weekly among others
writer editor stan lee and artist and co plotter steve ditko created the character of spider man and the pair produced issues from march to july
ditko left after the th issue while lee remained as writer until issue
since then many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years chronicling the adventures of marvels most identifiable hero
the amazing spider man has been the characters flagship series for his first fifty years in publication and was the only monthly series to star spider man until peter parker the spectacular spider man in although saw the debut of marvel team up with the vast majority of issues featuring spider man along with a rotating cast of other marvel characters
most of the major characters and villains of the spider man saga have been introduced in amazing and with few exceptions it is where most key events in the characters history have occurred
the title was published continuously until no
when marvel comics relaunched it as vol
but on spider mans th anniversary this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series beginning again with issue no
and lasting until the final issue no
due to strong sales on the characters first appearance in amazing fantasy no
spider man was given his own ongoing series in march
the initial years of the series under lee and ditko chronicled spider mans nascent career as a masked super human vigilante with his civilian life as hard luck yet perpetually good humored and well meaning teenager peter parker
peter balanced his career as spider man with his job as a freelance photographer for the daily bugle under the bombastic editor publisher j
jonah jameson to support himself and his frail aunt may
at the same time peter dealt with public hostility towards spider man and the antagonism of his classmates flash thompson and liz allan at midtown high school while embarking on a tentative ill fated romance with jamesons secretary betty brant
by focusing on parkers everyday problems lee and ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed self doubting superhero and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick
ditkos quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of marvels most prominent artist jack kirby and combined with the humor and pathos of lees writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos
most of spider mans key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time
issue no
featured the first appearances of j
jonah jameson and his astronaut son john jameson and the supervillain the chameleon
it included the heros first encounter with the superhero team the fantastic four
issue no
featured the first appearance of the vulture and the tinkerer as well as the beginning of parkers freelance photography career at the newspaper the daily bugle
the lee ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters including doctor octopus in no
the sandman and betty brant in no
the lizard in no
living brain in no
electro in no
mysterio in no
the green goblin in no
kraven the hunter in no
reporter ned leeds in no
and the scorpion in no
the molten man was introduced in no
which also featured parkers graduation from high school
peter began attending empire state university in no
which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates gwen stacy and harry osborn
harrys father norman osborn first appeared in no
as a member of jamesons country club but was not named nor revealed as harrys father until no
one of the most celebrated issues of the lee ditko run is no
the third part of the story arc if this be my destiny
which features the dramatic scene of spider man through force of will and thoughts of family escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery
comics historian les daniels noted that steve ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of spider mans predicament complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save
peter david observed that after his origin this two page sequence from amazing spider man no
is perhaps the best loved sequence from the stan lee steve ditko era
steve saffel stated the full page ditko image from the amazing spider man no
is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come
and matthew k
manning wrote that ditkos illustrations for the first few pages of this lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in spider mans history
the story was chosen as no
in the greatest marvels of all time poll of marvels readers in
editor robert greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that these first five pages are a modern day equivalent to shakespeare as parkers soliloquy sets the stage for his next action
and with dramatic pacing and storytelling ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics
although credited only as artist for most of his run ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them leaving lee to script the dialogue
a rift between ditko and lee developed and the two men were not on speaking terms long before ditko completed his last issue the amazing spider man no
the exact reasons for the ditko lee split have never been fully explained
spider man successor artist john romita sr in a deposition recalled that lee and ditko ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything cultural social historically everything they disagreed on characters
in successor penciler romita srs first issue no
nemesis the green goblin discovers spider mans secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero
romitas spider man more polished and heroic looking than ditkos became the model for two decades
the lee romita era saw the introduction of such characters as daily bugle managing editor robbie robertson in no
and nypd captain george stacy father of parkers girlfriend gwen stacy in no
the most important supporting character to be introduced during the romita era was mary jane watson who made her first full appearance in no
although she first appeared in no
with her face obscured and had been mentioned since no
peter david wrote in that romita made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant blocked the readers view of her face in issue no
and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment
romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used ann margret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her form fitting short skirts
lee and romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in parkers world by improving parkers relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on spider mans adventures
the stories became more topical addressing issues such as civil rights racism prisoners rights the vietnam war and political elections
issue no
introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the kingpin who would become a major force as well in the superhero series daredevil
other notable first appearances in the lee romita era include the rhino in no
the shocker in no
the prowler in no
and the kingpins son richard fisk in no

this was the first spider man story to be penciled by gil kane who would alternate drawing duties with romita for the next year and a half and would draw several landmark issues
one such story took place in the controversial issues
writer editor lee defied the comics code authority with this story in which parkers friend harry osborn was hospitalized after over dosing on pills
lee wrote this story upon a request from the u
department of health education and welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs
citing its dictum against depicting drug use even in an anti drug context the cca refused to put its seal on these issues
with the approval of marvel publisher martin goodman lee had the comics published without the seal
the comics sold well and marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts
the cca subsequently loosened the code to permit negative depictions of drugs among other new freedoms

kane then succeeded romita as penciler although romita would continue inking kane for a time
issue featured the death of gwen stacy at the hands of the green goblin in the night gwen stacy died
her demise and the goblins apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of spider man

the annual featured a team up with doctor strange while the annual showcased a meeting with the punisher
roger stern who had written nearly issues of sister title the spectacular spider man took over amazing with
during his two years on the title stern augmented the backgrounds of long established spider man villains and with romita jr created the mysterious supervillain the hobgoblin in
fans engaged with the mystery of the hobgoblins secret identity which continued throughout and
one lasting change was the reintroduction of mary jane watson as a more serious mature woman who becomes peters confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity
stern also wrote the kid who collects spider man in the amazing spider man a story which ranks among his most popular
by mid tom defalco and ron frenz took over scripting and penciling

azincourt is a commune in the pas de calais department in northern france
it is situated north west of saint pol sur ternoise on the d road between hesdin and fruges
it is often erroneously known as agincourt in english as the village had never been called as such throughout its history however there is a village that is named agincourt located in the meurthe et moselle department in eastern france
the late medieval battle of azincourt between the english and the french took place in the commune in
the name is attested as aisincurt in derived from a germanic masculine name aizo aizino and the early northern french word curt
the name has no etymological link with agincourt meurthe et moselle which is derived separately from another germanic male name ingin
azincourt is known for being near the site of the battle fought on october in which the army led by king henry v of england defeated the forces led by charles dalbret on behalf of charles vi of france which has gone down in history as the battle of agincourt
according to m
forrest the french knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle
after he became king in henry viii is purported to have commissioned an english translation of a life of henry v so that he could emulate him on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against france would help him to impose himself on the european stage
in henry viii crossed the english channel stopping by at azincourt
the battle as was the tradition was named after a nearby castle called azincourt
the castle has since disappeared and the settlement now known as azincourt adopted the name in the seventeenth century
john cassell wrote in that the village of azincourt itself is now a group of dirty farmhouses and wretched cottages but where the hottest of the battle raged between that village and the commune of tramecourt there still remains a wood precisely corresponding with the one in which henry placed his ambush and there are yet existing the foundations of the castle of azincourt from which the king named the field
the original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of action man figures
this has now been replaced by the centre historique mdival dazincourt a more professional museum conference centre and exhibition space incorporating laser video slide shows audio commentaries and some interactive elements
the museum building is shaped like a longbow similar to those used at the battle by archers under king henry
since a large medieval festival organised by the local community the chm the azincourt alliance and various other uk societies commemorating the battle local history and medieval life arts and crafts has been held in the village
prior to this date the festival was held in october but due to the inclement weather and local heavy clay soil making the festival difficult it was moved to the last sunday in july

berthold konrad hermann albert speer was a german architect who served as the minister of armaments and war production in nazi germany during most of world war ii
a close ally of adolf hitler he was convicted at the nuremberg trials and sentenced to years in prison
an architect by training speer joined the nazi party in
his architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the party and he became a member of hitlers inner circle
hitler commissioned him to design and construct structures including the reich chancellery and the nazi party rally grounds in nuremberg
in hitler appointed speer as general building inspector for berlin
in this capacity he was responsible for the central department for resettlement that evicted jewish tenants from their homes in berlin
in february speer was appointed as reich minister of armaments and war production
using misleading statistics he promoted himself as having performed an armaments miracle that was widely credited with keeping germany in the war
in speer established a task force to increase production of fighter aircraft
it became instrumental in exploiting slave labor for the benefit of the german war effort
after the war albert speer was among the major war criminals charged with the crimes of the nazi regime before the international military tribunal
he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for the use of slave labor narrowly avoiding a death sentence
having served his full term speer was released in
he used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books inside the third reich and
speers books were a success the public was fascinated by an inside view of the third reich
he died of a stroke in
through his autobiographies and interviews speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the crimes of the third reich
he continued to deny explicit knowledge of and responsibility for the holocaust
this image dominated his historiography in the decades following the war giving rise to the speer myth the perception of him as an apolitical technocrat responsible for revolutionizing the german war machine
the myth began to fall apart in the s when the armaments miracle was attributed to nazi propaganda
adam tooze wrote in the wages of destruction that the idea that speer was an apolitical technocrat was absurd
martin kitchen writing in stated that much of the increase in germanys arms production was actually due to systems instituted by speers predecessor and that speer was intimately aware of and involved in the final solution evidence of which has been conclusively shown in the decades following the nuremberg trials
speer was born in mannheim into an upper middle class family
he was the second of three sons of luise mthilde wilhelmine and albert friedrich speer
in the family leased their mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in heidelberg
henry t
king deputy prosecutor at the nuremberg trials who later wrote a book about speer said love and warmth were lacking in the household of speers youth
his brothers ernst and hermann bullied him throughout his childhood
speer was active in sports taking up skiing and mountaineering
he followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture
speer began his architectural studies at the university of karlsruhe instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the hyperinflation crisis of limited his parents income
in when the crisis had abated he transferred to the much more reputable technical university of munich
in he transferred again this time to the technical university of berlin where he studied under heinrich tessenow whom speer greatly admired
after passing his exams in speer became tessenows assistant a high honor for a man of
as such speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies
in munich speer began a close friendship ultimately spanning over years with rudolf wolters who also studied under tessenow
in mid speer began courting margarete weber the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed workers
the relationship was frowned upon by speers class conscious mother who felt the webers were socially inferior
despite this opposition the two married in berlin on august seven years elapsed before margarete was invited to stay at her in laws home
the couple would have six children together but albert speer grew increasingly distant from his family after
he remained so even after his release from imprisonment in despite their efforts to forge closer bonds
in january speer applied for nazi party membership and on march he became member number
the same year with stipends shrinking amid the depression speer surrendered his position as tessenows assistant and moved to mannheim hoping to make a living as an architect
after he failed to do so his father gave him a part time job as manager of his properties
in july the speers visited berlin to help out the party before the reichstag elections
while they were there his friend nazi party official karl hanke recommended the young architect to joseph goebbels to help renovate the partys berlin headquarters
when the commission was completed speer returned to mannheim and remained there as hitler took office in january
the organizers of the nuremberg rally asked speer to submit designs for the rally bringing him into contact with hitler for the first time
neither the organizers nor rudolf hess were willing to decide whether to approve the plans and hess sent speer to hitlers munich apartment to seek his approval
this work won speer his first national post as nazi party commissioner for the artistic and technical presentation of party rallies and demonstrations
shortly after hitler came into power he began to make plans to rebuild the chancellery
at the end of he contracted paul troost to renovate the entire building
hitler appointed speer whose work for goebbels had impressed him to manage the building site for troost
as chancellor hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations
after one of these briefings hitler invited speer to lunch to the architects great excitement
speer quickly became part of hitlers inner circle he was expected to call on him in the morning for a walk or chat to provide consultation on architectural matters and to discuss hitlers ideas
most days he was invited to dinner
in the english version of his memoirs speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his monthly dues
he assumed his german readers would not be so gullible and told them the nazi party offered a new mission
he was more forthright in an interview with william hamsher in which he said he joined the party in order to save germany from communism
after the war he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance
like many of those in power in the third reich he was not an ideologue nor was he anything more than an instinctive anti semite
the historian magnus brechtken discussing speer said he did not give anti jewish public speeches and that his anti semitism can best be understood through his actions which were anti semitic
brechtken added that throughout speers life his central motives were to gain power rule and acquire wealth
when troost died on january speer effectively replaced him as the partys chief architect
hitler appointed speer as head of the chief office for construction which placed him nominally on hesss staff
one of speers first commissions after troosts death was the zeppelinfeld stadium in nuremberg
it was used for nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in leni riefenstahls propaganda film triumph of the will
the building was able to hold people
speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight nazis
nuremberg was the site of many official nazi buildings
many more buildings were planned
if built the german stadium in nuremberg would have accommodated spectators
speer modified werner marchs design for the being built for the summer olympics
he added a stone exterior that pleased hitler
speer designed the german pavilion for the international exposition in paris
on january hitler appointed speer as general building inspector for the reich capital
this carried with it the rank of state secretary in the reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the berlin city government
he was to report directly to hitler and was independent of both the mayor and the gauleiter of berlin
hitler ordered speer to develop plans to rebuild berlin
these centered on a three mile long grand boulevard running from north to south which speer called the prachtstrasse or street of magnificence he also referred to it as the north south axis
at the northern end of the boulevard speer planned to build the volkshalle a huge domed assembly hall over high with floor space for people
at the southern end of the avenue a great triumphal arch almost high and able to fit the arc de triomphe inside its opening was planned
the existing berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled and two large new stations built
speer hired wolters as part of his design team with special responsibility for the prachtstrasse
the outbreak of world war ii in led to the postponement and later the abandonment of these plans which after nazi capitulation speer himself considered as awful
plans to build a new reich chancellery had been underway since
land had been purchased by the end of and starting in march the first buildings were demolished to create space at vostrae
speer was involved virtually from the beginning
in the aftermath of the night of the long knives he had been commissioned to renovate the borsig palace on the corner of vostrae and wilhelmstrae as headquarters of the sturmabteilung
he completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by may
in june he charged a personal honorarium of reichsmark and estimated the chancellery would be completed within three to four years
detailed plans were completed in july and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on january
on january speer received plenipotentiary powers from hitler to finish the new chancellery by january
for propaganda hitler claimed during the topping out ceremony on august that he had ordered speer to complete the new chancellery that year
shortages of labor meant the construction workers had to work in ten to twelve hour shifts
the ss built two concentration camps in and used the inmates to quarry stone for its construction
a brick factory was built near the oranienburg concentration camp at speers behest when someone commented on the poor conditions there speer stated the yids got used to making bricks while in egyptian captivity
the chancellery was completed in early january
the building itself was hailed by hitler as the crowning glory of the greater german political empire
during the chancellery project the pogrom of kristallnacht took place
speer made no mention of it in the first draft of inside the third reich
it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the central synagogue in berlin from his car
kristallnacht accelerated speers ongoing efforts to dispossess berlins jews from their homes
from on speers department used the nuremberg laws to evict jewish tenants of non jewish landlords in berlin to make way for non jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing
eventually jews were displaced by these measures
speer denied he knew they were being put on holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were completely free and their families were still in their apartments
he also said
en route to my ministry on the city highway i could see
crowds of people on the platform of nearby nikolassee railroad station
i knew that these must be berlin jews who were being evacuated
i am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as i drove past
i presumably had a sense of somber events
matthias schmidt said speer had personally inspected concentration camps and described his comments as an outright farce
martin kitchen described speers often repeated line that he knew nothing of the dreadful things as hollow not only was he fully aware of the fate of the jews he actively participated in their persecution
as germany started world war ii in europe speer instituted quick reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris before long these units would be used to clear bomb sites
speer used forced jewish labor on these projects in addition to regular german workers
construction stopped on the berlin and nremberg plans at the outbreak of war
though stockpiling of materials and other work continued this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for the armament industry
speers offices undertook building work for each branch of the military and for the ss using slave labor
speers building work made him among the wealthiest of the nazi elite
as one of the younger and more ambitious men in hitlers inner circle speer was approaching the height of his power
in prussian minister president hermann gring had appointed him to the prussian state council
in he was elected to the reichstag from electoral constituency
on february reich minister of armaments and munitions fritz todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from hitlers eastern headquarters at rastenburg
speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted todts offer to fly with him to berlin
speer cancelled some hours before take off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with hitler
hitler appointed speer in todts place
martin kitchen a british historian says that the choice was not surprising
speer was loyal to hitler and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job
speer succeeded todt not only as reich minister but in all his other powerful positions including inspector general of german roadways inspector general for water and energy and head of the nazi partys office of technology
at the same time hitler also appointed speer as head of the organisation todt a massive government controlled construction company
characteristically hitler did not give speer any clear remit he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control
as an example he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under grings four year plan
gring was reluctant to grant this
however speer secured hitlers support and on march gring signed a decree naming speer general plenipotentiary for armament tasks in the four year plan
speer proved to be ambitious unrelenting and ruthless
speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army but in the whole armed forces
it did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control
by april speer had persuaded gring to create a three member central planning board within the four year plan which he used to obtain supreme authority over procurement and allocation of raw materials and scheduling of production in order to consolidate german war production in a single agency
speer was fted at the time and in the post war era for performing an armaments miracle in which german war production dramatically increased
this miracle was brought to a halt in the summer of by among other factors the first sustained allied bombing
other factors probably contributed to the increase more than speer himself
germanys armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor todt
naval armaments were not under speers supervision until october nor the luftwaffes armaments until june of the following year
yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under speers control
another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry
production of every type of weapon peaked in june and july but there was now a severe shortage of fuel
after august oil from the romanian fields was no longer available
oil production became so low that any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle
as minister of armaments speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army
with hitlers full agreement he decided to prioritize tank production and he was given unrivaled power to ensure success
hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks but kept changing his mind about the specifications
this delayed the program and speer was unable to remedy the situation
in consequence despite tank production having the highest priority relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it
this led to a significant german army failure at the battle of prokhorovka a major turning point on the eastern front against the soviet red army
as head of organisation todt speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps
he agreed to expand auschwitz and some other camps allocating million reichsmarks for the work to be carried out
this allowed an extra huts to be built at auschwitz increasing the total human capacity to
included in the building works was material to build gas chambers crematoria and morgues
the ss called this professor speers special programme
speer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces there was a labor shortage in the war economy and not enough workers for his factories
in response hitler appointed fritz sauckel as a manpower dictator to obtain new workers
speer and sauckel cooperated closely to meet speers labor demands
hitler gave sauckel a free hand to obtain labor something that delighted speer who had requested voluntary laborers to meet the need for armament workers
sauckel had whole villages in france holland and belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to speers factories
sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods
in occupied areas of the soviet union that had been subject to partisan action civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in germany
by april sauckel had supplied voluntary laborers forced laborers prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to speer for use in his armaments factories
it was for the maltreatment of these people that speer was principally convicted at the nuremberg trials
following his appointment as minister of armaments speer was in control of armaments production solely for the army
he coveted control of the production of armaments for the luftwaffe and kriegsmarine as well
he set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition
his close relationship with hitler provided him with political protection and he was able to outwit and outmaneuver his rivals in the regime
hitlers cabinet was dismayed at his tactics but regardless he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power
by july he had gained control of armaments production for the luftwaffe and kriegsmarine
in august he took control of most of the ministry of economics to become in admiral dnitzs words europes economic dictator
his formal title was changed on september to reich minister for armaments and war production
he had become one of the most powerful people in nazi germany
speer and his hand picked director of submarine construction believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output
this belief proved incorrect and speer and merkers attempt to build the kriegsmarines new generation of submarines the type xxi and type xxiii as prefabricated sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program
the designs were rushed into production and the completed submarines were crippled by flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed
while dozens of submarines were built few ever entered service
in december speer visited organisation todt workers in lapland where he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months
he was under the dubious care of professor karl gebhardt at a medical clinic called hohenlychen where patients mysteriously failed to survive
in mid january speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill
concerned about retaining power he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the armaments ministry from his bedside
speers illness coincided with the allied big week a series of bombing raids on the german aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production
his political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with hitler
he lost hitlers unconditional support and began to lose power
in response to the allied big week adolf hitler authorized the creation of a fighter staff committee
its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production
the task force was established by march orders of speer with support from erhard milch of the reich aviation ministry
production of german fighter aircraft more than doubled between and
the growth however consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for allied aircraft
on august speer merged the fighter staff into a newly formed armament staff committee
the fighter staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labor in the war economy
the ss provided prisoners for separate projects from various concentration camps including mittelbau dora
prisoners worked for junkers messerschmitt henschel and among others
to increase production speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce
those who feigned illness slacked off sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps
in this became endemic over half a million workers were arrested
by this time people were working in speers underground factories
these factories were death traps discipline was brutal with regular executions
there were so many corpses at the dora underground factory for example that the crematorium was overwhelmed
speers own staff described the conditions there as hell
the largest technological advance under speers command came through the rocket program
it began in but had not supplied any weaponry
speer enthusiastically supported the program and in march made an order for a rockets the predecessor of the worlds first ballistic missile the v rocket
the rockets were researched at a facility in peenemnde along with the v flying bomb
the v s first target was paris on september
the program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy
the large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness
the rockets were built at an underground factory at mittelwerk
labor to build the a rockets came from the mittelbau dora concentration camp
of the people who ended up at the camp died due to the appalling conditions
on april speer lost control of organisation todt to his deputy franz xaver dorsch
he opposed the assassination attempt against hitler on july
he was not involved in the plot and played a minor role in the regimes efforts to regain control over berlin after hitler survived
after the plot speers rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party
he lost yet more authority
losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the german economy from late
air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies
in january speer told goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year
however he concluded that the war was lost after soviet forces captured the important silesian industrial region later that month
nevertheless speer believed that germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the allies than the unconditional surrender they insisted upon
during january and february speer claimed that his ministry would deliver decisive weapons and a large increase in armaments production which would bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield
speer gained control over the railways in february and asked heinrich himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair
by mid march speer had accepted that germanys economy would collapse within the next eight weeks
while he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture so that they could be used after the war he still supported the wars continuation
speer provided hitler with a memorandum on march which detailed germanys dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure
three days later he also proposed to hitler that germanys remaining military resources be concentrated along the rhine and vistula rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting
this ignored military realities as the german armed forces were unable to match the allies firepower and were facing total defeat
hitler rejected speers proposal to cease demolitions
instead he issued the nero decree on march which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated
speer was appalled by this order and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it
during a meeting with speer on march hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions
speer ended them though the army continued to blow up bridges
by april little was left of the armaments industry and speer had few official duties
speer visited the fhrerbunker on april for the last time
he met hitler and toured the damaged chancellery before leaving berlin to return to hamburg
speer would later claim in his memoirs that during this visit he confessed to hitler
that he was disobeying his scorched earth policy an assertion which has been described as pure invention by historian richard j
on april the day before committing suicide hitler dictated a final political testament which dropped speer from the successor government
speer was to be replaced by his subordinate karl otto saur
speer was disappointed that hitler had not selected him as his successor
after hitlers death speer offered his services to hitlers successor karl dnitz
on may dnitz asked lutz graf schwerin von krosigk to form a new government and discussions went on about the formation of the administration for the next few days
on may schwerin von krosigk presented his cabinet and speer was named as minister of industry and production
speer provided information to the allies regarding the effects of the air war and on a broad range of subjects beginning on may
on may two weeks after the surrender of german forces british troops arrested the members of the flensburg government and brought nazi germany to a formal end
speer was taken to several internment centres for nazi officials and interrogated
in september he was told that he would be tried for war crimes and several days later he was moved to nuremberg and incarcerated there
speer was indicted on four counts participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace planning initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace war crimes and crimes against humanity
the chief united states prosecutor robert h
jackson of the us supreme court said speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into german war industries which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation
speers attorney hans flchsner successfully contrasted speer from other defendants and portrayed him as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non ideologue
speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for the use of slave labor and forced labor
he was acquitted on the other two counts
he had claimed that he was unaware of nazi extermination plans and the allies had no proof that he was aware
his claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in and publicly disclosed in
on october he was sentenced to years imprisonment
while three of the eight judges advocated the death penalty for speer the other judges did not and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions
on july speer was transferred to spandau prison in berlin to serve his prison term
there he was known as prisoner number five
speers parents died while he was incarcerated
his father who died in despised the nazis and was silent upon meeting hitler
his mother died in
as a nazi party member she had greatly enjoyed dining with hitler
wolters and longtime speer secretary annemarie kempf while not permitted direct communication with speer in spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests speer put in letters to his wife the only written communication he was officially allowed
beginning in speer had the services of toni proost a sympathetic dutch orderly to smuggle mail and his writings
in wolters opened a bank account for speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from speers activities during the war
initially the funds were used only to support speers family but increasingly the money was used for other purposes
they paid for toni proost to go on holiday and for bribes to those who might be able to secure speers release
once speer became aware of the existence of the fund he sent detailed instructions about what to do with the money
wolters raised a total of dm for speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence
the prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs
speer was able to have his writings sent to wolters however and they eventually amounted to pages
he had completed his memoirs by november which became the basis of inside the third reich
in spandau diaries speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a faustian bargain for which he endured a harsh prison sentence
much of speers energy was dedicated to keeping fit both physically and mentally during his long confinement
spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening
speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns flower beds shrubbery and fruit trees
to make his daily walks around the garden more engaging speer embarked on an imaginary trip around the globe
speer started his walk from berlin and went eastward across the entirety of eurasia crossed the bering strait into alaska and then traveled south down the west coast of north america
carefully measuring distance travelled each day he mapped distances to the real world geography
he had walked more than ending his sentence near guadalajara mexico
speer also read studied architectural journals and brushed up on english and french
in his writings speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison
his sentence of twenty years amounted to days which only allotted one and a half days per book
speers supporters maintained calls for his release
among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were charles de gaulle and us diplomat george wildman ball
willy brandt was an advocate of his release putting an end to the de nazification proceedings against him which could have caused his property to be confiscated
speers efforts for an early release came to naught
the soviet union having demanded a death sentence at trial was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence
speer served a full term and was released at midnight on october
speers release from prison was a worldwide media event
reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside spandau and the lobby of the hotel berlin where speer spent the night
he said little reserving most comments for a major interview published in der spiegel in november
although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career his sole project a collaboration for a brewery was unsuccessful
instead he revised his spandau writings into two autobiographical books inside the third reich and
he later published a work about himmler and the ss which has been published in english as the slave state heinrich himmlers masterplan for ss supremacy or infiltration how heinrich himmler schemed to build an ss industrial empire
speer was aided in shaping the works by joachim fest and wolf jobst siedler from the publishing house ullstein
he found himself unable to re establish a relationship with his children even with his son albert who had also become an architect
according to speers daughter hilde schramm one by one my sister and brothers gave up
there was no communication
he supported hermann his brother financially after the war
however his other brother ernst had died in the battle of stalingrad despite repeated requests from his parents for speer to repatriate him
following his release from spandau speer donated the chronicle his personal diary to the german federal archives
it had been edited by wolters and made no mention of the jews
david irving discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited chronicle and independent documents
speer asked wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but wolters refused and retained an original copy
wolters friendship with speer deteriorated and one year before speers death wolters gave matthias schmidt access to the unedited chronicle
schmidt authored the first book highly critical of speer
speers memoirs were a phenomenal success
the public was fascinated by an inside view of the third reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight
importantly he provided an alibi to older germans who had been nazis
if speer who had been so close to hitler had not known the full extent of the crimes of the nazi regime and had just been following orders then they could tell themselves and others they too had done the same
so great was the need to believe this speer myth that fest and siedler were able to strengthen it even in the face of mounting historical evidence to the contrary
speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers
in october he made his first trip to britain flying to london to be interviewed on the bbc midweek programme
in the same year he appeared on the television programme the world at war
speer returned to london in to participate in the bbc newsnight programme
he suffered a stroke and died in london on september
he had remained married to his wife but he had formed a relationship with a german woman living in london and was with her at the time of his death
his daughter margret nissen wrote in her memoirs that after his release from spandau he spent all of his time constructing the speer myth
after his release from spandau speer portrayed himself as the good nazi
he was well educated middle class and bourgeois and could contrast himself with those who in the popular mind typified bad nazis
in his memoirs and interviews he had distorted the truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as myths
speer even invented his own births circumstances stating falsely that he was born at midday amid crashes of thunder and bells of the nearby christ church whereas it was between three and five oclock and the church was built only some years after
speer took his myth making to a mass media level and his cunning apologies were reproduced frequently in post war germany
isabell trommer writes in her biography of speer that fest and siedler were co authors of speers memoirs and co creators of his myths
in return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements
speer siedler and fest had constructed a masterpiece the image of the good nazi remained in place for decades despite historical evidence indicating that it was false
speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an apolitical technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the third reich
this construction was accepted almost at face value by historian hugh trevor roper when investigating the death of adolf hitler for british intelligence and in writing the last days of hitler
trevor roper frequently refers to speer as a technocrat nourished a technocrats philosophy one who cared only for his building projects or his ministerial duties and who thought that politics was irrelevant at least until hitlers nero decree which speer according to his own telling worked assiduously to counter
trevor roper who calls speer an administrative genius whose basic instincts were peaceful and constructive does take speer to task however for his failure to recognize the immorality of hitler and nazism calling him the real criminal of nazi germany for ten years he sat at the very centre of political power his keen intelligence diagnosed the nature and observed the mutations of nazi government and policy he saw and despised the personalities around him he heard their outrageous orders and understood their fantastic ambitions but he did nothing
supposing politics to be irrelevant he turned aside and built roads and bridges and factories while the logical consequences of government by madmen emerged
ultimately when their emergence involved the ruin of all his work speer accepted the consequences and acted
then it was too late germany had been destroyed
after speers death matthias schmidt published a book that demonstrated that speer had ordered the eviction of jews from their berlin homes
by historians had amply demonstrated that speer had lied extensively
even so public perceptions of speer did not change substantially until heinrich breloer aired the biographical film speer und er on tv in
the film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal
adam tooze in his book the wages of destruction said speer had manoeuvred himself through the ranks of the regime skillfully and ruthlessly and that the idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was absurd
trommer said he was not an apolitical technocrat instead he was one of the most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in the nazi regime
kitchen said he had deceived the nuremberg tribunal and post war germany
brechtken said that if his extensive involvement in the holocaust had been known at the time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death
the image of the good nazi was supported by numerous speer myths
in addition to the myth that he was an apolitical technocrat he claimed he did not have full knowledge of the holocaust or the persecution of the jews
another myth posits that speer revolutionized the german war machine after his appointment as minister of armaments
he was credited with a dramatic increase in the shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping germany in the war
another myth centered around a faked plan to assassinate hitler with poisonous gas
the idea for this myth came to him after he recalled the panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system
he fabricated the additional details
brechtken wrote that his most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a french journalist in
the journalist described an invented scenario in which speer had refused hitlers orders and hitler had left with tears in his eyes
speer liked the scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs
the journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths
speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of hitlers leadership
despite his opposition to the july plot he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters
he maintained hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers
this formed a key element of the myths speer encouraged
speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian populations survival
in reality he had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction germany suffered in the conflicts final months
speer maintained at the nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the holocaust
he admitted only to being uncomfortable around jews in the published version of the spandau diaries
in his final statement at nuremberg speer gave the impression of apologizing although he did not directly admit any personal guilt and the only victim he mentioned was the german people
historian martin kitchen states that speer was actually fully aware of what had happened to the jews and was intimately involved in the final solution
brechtken said speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility
speer was photographed with slave laborers at mauthausen concentration camp during a visit on march he also visited gusen concentration camp
although survivor francisco boix testified at the nuremberg trials about speers visit taylor writes that had the photo been available he would have been hanged
in the daily telegraph reported that documents had surfaced indicating that speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of auschwitz concentration camp after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand jews were massacred
heinrich breloer discussing the construction of auschwitz said speer was not just a cog in the work he was the terror itself
speer did not deny being present at the posen speeches to nazi leaders at a conference in posen on october but claimed to have left the auditorium before himmler said during his speech the grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth and later the jews must be exterminated
speer is mentioned several times in the speech and himmler addresses him directly
in the guardian reported that a letter from speer dated december had been found in a collection of his correspondence with hlne jeanty the widow of a belgian resistance fighter
in the letter speer says there is no doubt i was present as himmler announced on october that all jews would be killed
speer was credited with an armaments miracle
during the winter of in the light of germanys disastrous defeat in the battle of moscow the german leadership including friedrich fromm georg thomas and fritz todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won
the rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat
speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy
he produced spectacular statistics claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production a fourfold increase in artillery production and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country
he was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended
the armaments miracle was a myth speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims
the production of armaments did rise however this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before speer came to office the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity
by july speers armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the german public
little remains of speers personal architectural works other than the plans and photographs
no buildings designed by speer during the nazi era are extant in berlin other than the entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the victory column or siegessule and the schwerbelastungskrper a heavy load bearing body built around
the concrete cylinder high was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures planned within hitlers post war renewal project for the city of berlin as the world capital germania
the cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public
the tribune of the zeppelinfeld stadium in nuremberg though partly demolished can also be seen
during the war the speer designed new reich chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the battle of berlin
the exterior walls survived but they were eventually dismantled by the soviets
unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the humboldt university mohrenstrae metro station and soviet war memorials in berlin
informational notes citations bibliography asteraceae is a large family of flowering plants that consists of over known species in over genera within the order asterales
the number of species in asteraceae is rivaled only by the orchidaceae and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of extant species in each family is unknown
the asteraceae were first described in the year and given the original name compositae
the family is commonly known as the aster daisy composite or sunflower family
most species of asteraceae are herbaceous plants and may be annual biennial or perennial but there are also shrubs vines and trees
the family has a widespread distribution from subpolar to tropical regions in a wide variety of habitats
most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi desert climates and they are found on every continent but antarctica
their common primary characteristic is compound flower heads technically known as capitula consisting of sometimes hundreds of tiny individual florets enclosed by a whorl of protective involucral bracts
the oldest known fossils are pollen grains from the late cretaceous of antarctica dated to million years ago
it is estimated that the crown group of asteraceae evolved at least mya with a stem node age of mya
asteraceae is an economically important family providing food staples garden plants and herbal medicines
species outside of their native ranges can become weedy or invasive
members of the asteraceae are mostly herbaceous plants but some shrubs vines and trees do exist
asteraceae species are generally easy to distinguish from other plants because of their unique inflorescence and other shared characteristics such as the joined anthers of the stamens
nonetheless determining genera and species of some groups such as hieracium is notoriously difficult
members of the family asteraceae generally produce taproots but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems
some species have underground stems in the form of caudices or rhizomes
these can be fleshy or woody depending on the species
the stems are herbaceous aerial branched and cylindrical with glandular hairs usually erect but can be prostrate to ascending
the stems can contain secretory canals with resin or latex which is particularly common among the cichorioideae
leaves can be alternate opposite or whorled
they may be simple but are often deeply lobed or otherwise incised often conduplicate or revolute
the margins also can be entire or toothed
resin or latex can also be present in the leaves
nearly all asteraceae bear their flowers in dense flower heads called capitula
they are surrounded by involucral bracts and when viewed from a distance each capitulum may appear to be a single flower
enlarged outer flowers in the capitulum may resemble petals and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx
in plants of the asteraceae what appears to be a single daisy type flower is actually a composite of several much smaller flowers known as the capitulum or head
by visually presenting as a single flower the capitulum functions in attracting pollinators in the same manner that other showy flowering plants in numerous other older plant families have evolved to attract pollinators
the previous name for the family compositae reflects the fact that what appears to be a single floral entity is in fact a composite of much smaller flowers
the petals or sunrays in an asteraceous head are in fact individual strap shaped flowers called ray flowers or ray florets and the sun disk is made up of smaller radially symmetric individual flowers called disc flowers or disc florets
the word aster means star in greek referring to the appearance of most family members as a celestial body with rays
the capitulum which often appears to be a single flower is often referred to as a head
in some species the entire head is able to pivot its floral stem in the course of the day to track the sun thus maximizing the reflectivity of the entire floral unit and further attracting flying pollinators
nearest to the flower stem lie a series of small usually green scale like bracts
these are known as phyllaries collectively they form the involucre which serves to protect the immature head of florets during its development
the individual florets are arranged atop a dome like structure called the receptacle
the individual florets in a head consist developmentally of five fused petals instead of sepals they have threadlike hairy or bristly structures known collectively as a pappus
the pappus surrounds the ovary and can when mature and attached to a seed adhere to animal fur or be carried by air currents aiding in seed dispersal
the whitish fluffy head of a dandelion commonly blown on by children consists of numerous seeds resting on the receptacle each seed attached to its pappus
the pappi provide a parachute like structure to help the seed travel from its point of origin to a more hospitable site
in the nervous system axons may be myelinated or unmyelinated
this is the provision of an insulating layer called a myelin sheath
the myelin membrane is unique in its relatively high lipid to protein ratio
in the peripheral nervous system axons are myelinated by glial cells known as schwann cells
in the central nervous system the myelin sheath is provided by another type of glial cell the oligodendrocyte
schwann cells myelinate a single axon
an oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to axons
the composition of myelin is different in the two types
in the cns the major myelin protein is proteolipid protein and in the pns it is myelin basic protein
nodes of ranvier are short unmyelinated segments of a myelinated axon which are found periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath
therefore at the point of the node of ranvier the axon is reduced in diameter
these nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated
in saltatory conduction electrical currents produced at each node of ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line where they remain strong enough to generate another action potential
thus in a myelinated axon action potentials effectively jump from node to node bypassing the myelinated stretches in between resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain
an axon can divide into many branches called telodendria
at the end of each telodendron is an axon terminal
axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles that store the neurotransmitter for release at the synapse
this makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible
sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron when it is known as an autapse
in the normally developed brain along the shaft of some axons are located pre synaptic boutons also known as axonal varicosities and these have been found in regions of the hippocampus that function in the release of neurotransmitters
however axonal varicosities are also present in neurodegenerative diseases where they interfere with the conduction of an action potential
axonal varicosities are also the hallmark of traumatic brain injuries
axonal damage is usually to the axon cytoskeleton disrupting transport
as a consequence protein accumulations such as amyloid beta precursor protein can build up in a swelling resulting in a number of varicosities along the axon
most axons carry signals in the form of action potentials which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes synaptic contact with target cells
the defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is all or nothingevery action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape
this all or nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size
there are however some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals of variable amplitude
when an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal it activates the synaptic transmission process
the first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane
the resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes synaptic vesicles filled with a neurotransmitter chemical to fuse with the axons membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space
the neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through exocytosis
the neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell
the neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them
depending on the type of receptors that are activated the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell inhibit it or alter its metabolism in some way
this entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second
afterward inside the presynaptic terminal a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane ready to be released when the next action potential arrives
the action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron
extracellular recordings of action potential propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals
while extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as place cells axonal activity in both white and gray matter can also be recorded
extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways
the signal has a shorter peak trough duration than of pyramidal cells or interneurons
the voltage change is triphasic
activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the four recording wires
in recordings from freely moving rats axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter
in fact the generation of action potentials in vivo is sequential in nature and these sequential spikes constitute the digital codes in the neurons
although previous studies indicate an axonal origin of a single spike evoked by short term pulses physiological signals in vivo trigger the initiation of sequential spikes at the cell bodies of the neurons
in addition to propagating action potentials to axonal terminals the axon is able to amplify the action potentials which makes sure a secure propagation of sequential action potentials toward the axonal terminal
in terms of molecular mechanisms voltage gated sodium channels in the axons possess lower threshold and shorter refractory period in response to short term pulses
the development of the axon to its target is one of the six major stages in the overall development of the nervous system
studies done on cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that neurons initially produce multiple neurites that are equivalent yet only one of these neurites is destined to become the axon
it is unclear whether axon specification precedes axon elongation or vice versa although recent evidence points to the latter
if an axon that is not fully developed is cut the polarity can change and other neurites can potentially become the axon
this alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least m shorter than the other neurites
after the incision is made the longest neurite will become the future axon and all the other neurites including the original axon will turn into dendrites
imposing an external force on a neurite causing it to elongate will make it become an axon
nonetheless axonal development is achieved through a complex interplay between extracellular signaling intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics
the extracellular signals that propagate through the extracellular matrix surrounding neurons play a prominent role in axonal development
these signaling molecules include proteins neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules
netrin a secreted protein functions in axon formation
when the unc netrin receptor is mutated several neurites are irregularly projected out of neurons and finally a single axon is extended anteriorly
the neurotrophic factorsnerve growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin are also involved in axon development and bind to trk receptors
the ganglioside converting enzyme plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase which is involved in the activation of trka at the tip of neutrites is required for the elongation of axons
pmgs asymmetrically distributes to the tip of the neurite that is destined to become the future axon
during axonal development the activity of pik is increased at the tip of destined axon
disrupting the activity of pik inhibits axonal development
activation of pik results in the production of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate which can cause significant elongation of a neurite converting it into an axon
as such the overexpression of phosphatases that dephosphorylate ptdins leads into the failure of polarization
the neurite with the lowest actin filament content will become the axon
pgms concentration and f actin content are inversely correlated when pgms becomes enriched at the tip of a neurite its f actin content is substantially decreased
in addition exposure to actin depolimerizing drugs and toxin b causes the formation of multiple axons
consequently the interruption of the actin network in a growth cone will promote its neurite to become the axon
growing axons move through their environment via the growth cone which is at the tip of the axon
the growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called a lamellipodium which contain protrusions called filopodia
the filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment
actin plays a major role in the mobility of this system
environments with high levels of cell adhesion molecules create an ideal environment for axonal growth
this seems to provide a sticky surface for axons to grow along
examples of cams specific to neural systems include n cam tag an axonal glycoproteinand mag all of which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily
another set of molecules called extracellular matrix adhesion molecules also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along
examples of these molecules include laminin fibronectin tenascin and perlecan
some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents
others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects
cells called guidepost cells assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth
these cells that help axon guidance are typically other neurons that are sometimes immature
when the axon has completed its growth at its connection to the target the diameter of the axon can increase by up to five times depending on the speed of conduction required
it has also been discovered through research that if the axons of a neuron were damaged as long as the soma is not damaged the axons would regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of guidepost cells
this is also referred to as neuroregeneration
nogo a is a type of neurite outgrowth inhibitory component that is present in the central nervous system myelin membranes
it has a crucial role in restricting axonal regeneration in adult mammalian central nervous system
in recent studies if nogo a is blocked and neutralized it is possible to induce long distance axonal regeneration which leads to enhancement of functional recovery in rats and mouse spinal cord
this has yet to be done on humans
a recent study has also found that macrophages activated through a specific inflammatory pathway activated by the dectin receptor are capable of promoting axon recovery also however causing neurotoxicity in the neuron
axons vary largely in length from a few micrometers up to meters in some animals
this emphasizes that there must be a cellular length regulation mechanism allowing the neurons both to sense the length of their axons and to control their growth accordingly
it was discovered that motor proteins play an important role in regulating the length of axons
based on this observation researchers developed an explicit model for axonal growth describing how motor proteins could affect the axon length on the molecular level
these studies suggest that motor proteins carry signaling molecules from the soma to the growth cone and vice versa whose concentration oscillates in time with a length dependent frequency
the axons of neurons in the human peripheral nervous system can be classified based on their physical features and signal conduction properties
axons were known to have different thicknesses and these differences were thought to relate to the speed at which an action potential could travel along the axonits conductance velocity
erlanger and gasser proved this hypothesis and identified several types of nerve fiber establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and its nerve conduction velocity
they published their findings in giving the first classification of axons
axons are classified in two systems
the first one introduced by erlanger and gasser grouped the fibers into three main groups using the letters a b and c
these groups group a group b and group c include both the sensory fibers and the motor fibers
the first group a was subdivided into alpha beta gamma and delta fibersa a a and a
the motor neurons of the different motor fibers were the lower motor neuronsalpha motor neuron beta motor neuron and gamma motor neuron having the a a and a nerve fibers respectively
later findings by other researchers identified two groups of aa fibers that were sensory fibers
these were then introduced into a system that only included sensory fibers
this system refers to the sensory groups as types and uses roman numerals type ia type ib type ii type iii and type iv
different sensory receptors innervate different types of nerve fibers
proprioceptors are innervated by type ia ib and ii sensory fibers mechanoreceptors by type ii and iii sensory fibers and nociceptors and thermoreceptors by type iii and iv sensory fibers
in order of degree of severity injury to a nerve in the peripheral nervous system can be described as neurapraxia axonotmesis or neurotmesis
concussion is considered a mild form of diffuse axonal injury
axonal injury can also cause central chromatolysis
the dysfunction of axons in the nervous system is one of the major causes of many inherited and acquired neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons
when an axon is crushed an active process of axonal degeneration takes place at the part of the axon furthest from the cell body
this degeneration takes place quickly following the injury with the part of the axon being sealed off at the membranes and broken down by macrophages
this is known as wallerian degeneration
dying back of an axon can also take place in many neurodegenerative diseases particularly when axonal transport is impaired this is known as wallerian like degeneration
studies suggest that the degeneration happens as a result of the axonal protein nmnat being prevented from reaching all of the axon
demyelination of axons causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease multiple sclerosis
dysmyelination is the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath
this is implicated in several leukodystrophies and also in schizophrenia
a severe traumatic brain injury can result in widespread lesions to nerve tracts damaging the axons in a condition known as diffuse axonal injury
this can lead to a persistent vegetative state
it has been shown in studies on the rat that axonal damage from a single mild traumatic brain injury can leave a susceptibility to further damage after repeated mild traumatic brain injuries
a nerve guidance conduit is an artificial means of guiding axon growth to enable neuroregeneration and is one of the many treatments used for different kinds of nerve injury
some general dictionaries define nerve fiber as any neuronal process including both axons and dendrites
however medical sources generally use nerve fiber to refer to the axon only
german anatomist otto friedrich karl deiters is generally credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites
swiss rdolf albert von klliker and german robert remak were the first to identify and characterize the axon initial segment
klliker named the axon in
louis antoine ranvier was the first to describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now commonly referred to as the nodes of ranvier
santiago ramn y cajal a spanish anatomist proposed that axons were the output components of neurons describing their functionality
joseph erlanger and herbert gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral nerve fibers based on axonal conduction velocity myelination fiber size etc
alan hodgkin and andrew huxley also employed the squid giant axon and by they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential leading to the formulation of the hodgkin huxley model
hodgkin and huxley were awarded jointly the nobel prize for this work in
the formulae detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the frankenhaeuser huxley equations
the understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced further and includes many details about individual ion channels
the axons in invertebrates have been extensively studied
the longfin inshore squid often used as a model organism has the longest known axon
the giant squid has the largest axon known
its size ranges from to mm in diameter and is used in the control of its jet propulsion system
the fastest recorded conduction speed of m s is found in the ensheathed axons of some pelagic penaeid shrimps and the usual range is between and meters s in other cases as seen in rat studies an axon originates from a dendrite such axons are said to have dendritic origin
some axons with dendritic origin similarly have a proximal initial segment that starts directly at the axon origin while others have a distal initial segment discernibly separated from the axon origin
in many species some of the neurons have axons that emanate from the dendrite and not from the cell body and these are known as axon carrying dendrites
in many cases an axon originates at an axon hillock on the soma such axons are said to have somatic origin
some axons with somatic origin have a proximal initial segment adjacent the axon hillock while others have a distal initial segment separated from the soma by an extended axon hillock
the ancient aramaic alphabet was used to write the aramaic languages spoken by ancient aramean pre christian tribes throughout the fertile crescent
it was also adopted by other peoples as their own alphabet when empires and their subjects underwent linguistic aramaization during a language shift for governing purposes a precursor to arabization centuries later including among the assyrians and babylonians who permanently replaced their akkadian language and its cuneiform script with aramaic and its script and among jews but not samaritans who adopted the aramaic language as their vernacular and started using the aramaic alphabet which they call square script even for writing hebrew displacing the former paleo hebrew alphabet
the modern hebrew alphabet derives from the aramaic alphabet in contrast to the modern samaritan alphabet which derives from paleo hebrew
the letters in the aramaic alphabet all represent consonants some of which are also used as matres lectionis to indicate long vowels
writing systems like the aramaic that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of matres lectionis or added diacritical signs have been called abjads by peter t
daniels to distinguish them from alphabets such as the greek alphabet that represent vowels more systematically
the term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet which would imply that a system like aramaic must be either a syllabary as argued by ignace gelb or an incomplete or deficient alphabet as most other writers had said before daniels
daniels put forward this is a different type of writing system intermediate between syllabaries and full alphabets
the aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern middle eastern writing systems can be traced back to it
that is primarily due to the widespread usage of the aramaic language after it was adopted as both a lingua franca and the official language of the neo assyrian and neo babylonian empires and their successor the achaemenid empire
among the descendant scripts in modern use the jewish hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the imperial aramaic script of the th century bc with an identical letter inventory and for the most part nearly identical letter shapes
by contrast the samaritan hebrew script is directly descended from proto hebrew phoenician script which was the ancestor of the aramaic alphabet
the aramaic alphabet was also an ancestor to the nabataean alphabet which had the arabic alphabet as a descendant
the earliest inscriptions in the aramaic language use the phoenician alphabet
over time the alphabet developed into the aramaic alphabet by the th century bc
it was used to write the aramaic languages spoken by ancient aramean pre christian tribes throughout the fertile crescent
it was also adopted by other peoples as their own alphabet when empires and their subjects underwent linguistic aramaization during a language shift for governing purposes a precursor to arabization centuries later
these include the assyrians and babylonians who permanently replaced their akkadian language and its cuneiform script with aramaic and its script and among jews but not samaritans who adopted the aramaic language as their vernacular and started using the aramaic alphabet even for writing hebrew displacing the former paleo hebrew alphabet
the modern hebrew alphabet derives from the aramaic alphabet in contrast to the modern samaritan alphabet which derives from paleo hebrew
around bc following the achaemenid conquest of mesopotamia under darius i old aramaic was adopted by the persians as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast persian empire with its different peoples and languages
the use of a single official language which modern scholarship has dubbed as official aramaic imperial aramaic or achaemenid aramaic can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the achaemenid persians in holding their far flung empire together for as long as they did
imperial aramaic was highly standardised
its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was influenced by old persian
the aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles the lapidary form usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to phoenician and early aramaic
both were in use through the achaemenid persian period but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary which had largely disappeared by the rd century bc
for centuries after the fall of the achaemenid empire in bc imperial aramaic or something near enough to it to be recognisable remained an influence on the various native iranian languages
the aramaic script survived as the essential characteristics of the iranian pahlavi writing system
aramaic documents from bactria have been recently discovered an analysis of which was published in november
the texts which were rendered on leather reflect the use of aramaic in the th century bc in the persian achaemenid administration of bactria and sogdiana
the widespread usage of achaemenid aramaic in the middle east led to the gradual adoption of the aramaic alphabet for writing hebrew
formerly hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of phoenician the paleo hebrew alphabet
since the evolution of the aramaic alphabet out of the phoenician one was a gradual process the division of the worlds alphabets into the ones derived from the phoenician one directly and the ones derived from phoenician via aramaic is somewhat artificial
in general the alphabets of the mediterranean region are classified as phoenician derived adapted from around the th century bc
those of the east are considered aramaic derived adapted from around the th century bc from the imperial aramaic script of the achaemenid empire
after the fall of the achaemenid empire the unity of the imperial aramaic script was lost diversifying into a number of descendant cursives
the hebrew and nabataean alphabets as they stood by the roman era were little changed in style from the imperial aramaic alphabet
ibn khaldun alleges that not only the old nabataean writing was influenced by the syrian script but also the old chaldean script
a cursive hebrew variant developed from the early centuries ad
it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive
by contrast the cursive developed out of the nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing arabic evolving into the arabic alphabet as it stood by the time of the early spread of islam
the development of cursive versions of aramaic led to the creation of the syriac palmyrene and mandaic alphabets which formed the basis of the historical scripts of central asia such as the sogdian and mongolian alphabets
the old turkic script is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in aramaic in particular via the pahlavi or sogdian alphabets as suggested by v
thomsen or possibly via kharosthi
brahmi script was also possibly derived or inspired by aramaic
brahmic family of scripts includes devanagari
today biblical aramaic jewish neo aramaic dialects and the aramaic language of the talmud are written in the modern hebrew alphabet distinguished from the old hebrew script
in classical jewish literature the name given to the modern hebrew script was ashurit the ancient assyrian script a script now known widely as the aramaic script
it is believed that during the period of assyrian dominion that aramaic script and language received official status
syriac and christian neo aramaic dialects are today written in the syriac alphabet which script has superseded the more ancient assyrian script and now bears its name
mandaic is written in the mandaic alphabet
the near identical nature of the aramaic and the classical hebrew alphabets caused aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard hebrew script in scholarly literature
in maaloula one of few surviving communities in which a western aramaic dialect is still spoken an aramaic language institute was established in by damascus university that teaches courses to keep the language alive
unlike classical syriac which has a rich literary tradition in syriac aramaic script western neo aramaic was solely passed down orally for generations until and was not utilized in a written form
therefore the language institutes chairman george rizkalla undertook the writing of a textbook in western neo aramaic
being previously unwritten rizkalla opted for the hebrew alphabet
in the institutes activities were halted due to concerns that the square maalouli aramaic alphabet used in the program bore a resemblance to the square script of the hebrew alphabet
as a result all signs featuring the square maalouli script were subsequently removed
the program stated that they would instead use the more distinct syriac aramaic alphabet although use of the maalouli alphabet has continued to some degree
al jazeera arabic also broadcast a program about western neo aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use
the imperial aramaic alphabet was added to the unicode standard in october with the release of version the syriac aramaic alphabet was added to the unicode standard in september with the release of version the syriac abbreviation can be represented with a special control character called the syriac abbreviation mark
the unicode block for syriac aramaic is u uf american shot or cowboy shot is a translation of a phrase from french film criticism and refers to a medium long film shot of a group of characters who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera
the usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others
the purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position
in some literature this is simply referred to as a shot
one of the other main reasons why french critics called it american shot was its frequent use in the western genre
this was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy usually holstered at their waist
it is actually the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both their face and their holstered gun in frame
the french critics thought it was characteristic of american films of the s or s however it was mostly characteristic of cheaper american movies such as charlie chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago
howard hawks legitimized this style in his films allowing characters to act even when not talking when most of the audience would not be paying attention
it became his trademark style
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord
as well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed adem also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation which as a result destroys the white matter
the cause is often a trigger such as from viral infection or vaccinations
adems symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases
however adem has several features that distinguish it from ms
unlike ms adem occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever although adolescents and adults can get the disease too
adem consists of a single flare up whereas ms is marked with several flare ups over a long period of time
relapses following adem are reported in up to a quarter of patients but the majority of these multiphasic presentations following adem likely represent ms
adem is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness coma and death which is very rare in ms except in severe cases
it affects about per people per year
although it occurs in all ages most reported cases are in children and adolescents with the average age around to years old
the disease affects males and females almost equally
adem shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months
the mortality rate may be as high as however full recovery is seen in to of cases with increase in survival rates up to to with figures including minor residual disability as well
the average time to recover from adem flare ups is one to six months
adem produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord particularly in the white matter
usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray white junction of both cerebral hemispheres cerebellum brainstem and spinal cord but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved
when a person has more than one demyelinating episode of adem the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis
also a fulminant course in adults has been described
adem has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course
symptoms usually begin weeks after infection
major symptoms include fever headache nausea and vomiting confusion vision impairment drowsiness seizures and coma
although initially the symptoms are usually mild they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days
additional symptoms include hemiparesis paraparesis and cranial nerve palsies
neurological symptoms were the main presentation of covid which did not correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms
the high incidence of adem with hemorrhage is striking
brain inflammation is likely caused by an immune response to the disease rather than neurotropism
csf analysis was not indicative of an infectious process neurological impairment was not present in the acute phase of the infection and neuroimaging findings were not typical of classical toxic and metabolic disorders
the finding of bilateral periventricular relatively asymmetrical lesions allied with deep white matter involvement that may also be present in cortical gray white matter junction thalami basal ganglia cerebellum and brainstem suggests an acute demyelination process
additionally hemorrhagic white matter lesions clusters of macrophages related to axonal injury and adem like appearance were also found in subcortical white matter
since the discovery of the anti mog specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that adem is one of the possible clinical causes of anti mog associated encephalomyelitis
the term adem has been inconsistently used at different times
currently the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the international pediatric ms study group revision
given that the definition is clinical it is currently unknown if all the cases of adem are positive for anti mog autoantibody in any case it appears to be strongly related to adem diagnosis
while adem and ms both involve autoimmune demyelination they differ in many clinical genetic imaging and histopathological aspects
some authors consider ms and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum differing only in chronicity severity and clinical course while others consider them discretely different diseases
typically adem appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic
nevertheless adem does occur in adults and can also be clinically multiphasic
problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis
if ms were defined only by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as mcdonald did it would not be enough to make a difference as some cases of adem satisfy these conditions
therefore some authors propose to establish the dividing line as the shape of the lesions around the veins being therefore perivenous vs
confluent demyelination
the pathology of adem is very similar to that of ms with some differences
the pathological hallmark of adem is perivenous inflammation with limited sleeves of demyelination
nevertheless ms like plaques can appear plaques in the white matter in ms are sharply delineated while the glial scar in adem is smooth
axons are better preserved in adem lesions
inflammation in adem is widely disseminated and ill defined and finally lesions are strictly perivenous while in ms they are disposed around veins but not so sharply
nevertheless the co occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy or even postmortem adem in adults can progress to ms when the person has more than one demyelinating episode of adem the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis
it has been found that anti mog auto antibodies are related to this kind of adem another variant of adem in adults has been described also related to anti mog auto antibodies has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis and it has been reported to be clinically adem but showing ms like lesions on autopsy
it has been classified inside the anti mog associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases
acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis weston hurst syndrome or hursts disease is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of adem
ahl is relatively rare it is seen in about of adem cases and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage and edema
death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids immunoglobulins cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange
about of survivors show residual neurological deficits but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the extent of the white matter affected
this disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and crohns disease malaria sepsis associated with immune complex deposition methanol poisoning and other underlying conditions
also anecdotal association with ms has been reported laboratory studies that support diagnosis of ahl are peripheral leukocytosis cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein
on magnetic resonance imaging lesions of ahl typically show extensive t weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages significant edema and mass effect
no controlled clinical trials have been conducted on adem treatment but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the cns is standard
the widely accepted first line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone followed by weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone
patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone
oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing and tend to show poorer outcomes
other anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect such as plasmapheresis high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide
these are considered alternative therapies used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect
there is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately in a study of children with adem recovered completely after high dose methylprednisolone one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after iv ig the five most severe cases with adam and severe peripheral neuropathy were treated with combined high dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin two remained paraplegic one had motor and cognitive handicaps and two recovered
a recent review of ivig treatment of adem found that of children showed complete recovery after treatment with ivig or ivig plus corticosteroids
a study of ivig treatment in adults with adem showed that ivig seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition consciousness and rigor
this same study found one subject a year old man who had not responded to steroids that responded to an ivig treatment days after disease onset
full recovery is seen in to of cases ranging to to recovery with some minor residual disability average time to recover is one to six months
the mortality rate may be as high as
poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy unusually severe neurological symptoms or sudden onset
children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes
the latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present
adem can progress to ms
it will be considered ms if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about to of cases the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis
patients with demyelinating illnesses such as ms have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability
research suggests that similar effects are seen after adem but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in ms
a study of six children with adem were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of years of recovery
all six children performed in the normal range on most tests including verbal iq and performance iq but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain such as complex attention short term memory and internalizing behaviour affect
group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms demonstrating that as a group they were normal
these deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of ms
another study compared nineteen children with a history of adem of which were five years of age or younger at the time and nine were older to nineteen matched controls
scores on iq tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset adem group compared to the late onset and control groups while the late onset adem children scored lower on verbal processing speed
again all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls meaning that while effects were statistically reliable the children were as a whole still within the normal range
there were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group although there is some suggestion that this may be due at least in part to the stress of hospitalization at a young age
the relationship between adem and anti mog associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research
a new entity called mogdem has been proposed
about animal models the main animal model for ms experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is also an animal model for adem
being an acute monophasic illness eae is far more similar to adem than ms
ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality speech changes and abnormalities in eye movements that indicates dysfunction of parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement such as the cerebellum
these nervous system dysfunctions occur in several different patterns with different results and different possible causes
ataxia can be limited to one side of the body which is referred to as hemiataxia
friedreichs ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom
dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia
the term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum
the cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning
although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia
people with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force range direction velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions
this results in a characteristic type of irregular uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways such as asthenia asynergy delayed reaction time and dyschronometria
individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait difficulty with eye movements dysarthria dysphagia hypotonia dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia
these deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged and whether the lesion is bi or unilateral
people with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait
as the condition progresses walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping as well as staggering and lurching from side to side
turning is also problematic and could result in falls
as cerebellar ataxia becomes severe great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk
dysarthria an impairment with articulation may also be present and is characterized by scanning speech that consists of slower rate irregular rhythm and variable volume
also slurring of speech tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration may occur
cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement particularly in the extremities
overshooting occurs with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing thus dysmetria is evident
impairments with alternating movements as well as dysrhythmia may also be displayed
tremor of the head and trunk may be seen in individuals with cerebellar ataxia
dysmetria is thought to be caused by a deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion
interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved
for example if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body flexion at the shoulder would create a torque at the elbow while extension of the elbow would create a torque at the wrist
these torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement
this may therefore explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations
the term sensory ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts
this is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain
in some cases the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information including the cerebellum thalamus and parietal lobes
sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady stomping gait with heavy heel strikes as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input such as in poorly lit environments
physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during physical examination by having patients stand with their feet together and eyes shut
in affected patients this will cause the instability to worsen markedly producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall this is called a positive rombergs test
worsening of the finger pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia
also when patients are standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician if the eyes are closed the patients fingers tend to fall down and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions
the term vestibular ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the vestibular system which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent vertigo nausea and vomiting
in slow onset chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction these characteristic manifestations may be absent and dysequilibrium may be the sole presentation
the three types of ataxia have overlapping causes so can either coexist or occur in isolation
cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging
any type of focal lesion of the central nervous system will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion cerebellar if in the cerebellum sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord
to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal
or vestibular if in the vestibular system
exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function
the most common example is ethanol which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia
chronic intake of ethanol causes atrophy of the cerebellum by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses induced by thiamine deficiency
other examples include various prescription drugs lithium level over meq l synthetic cannabinoid hu ingestion and various other medical and recreational drugs
a further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia especially in high doses are benzodiazepines
exposure to high levels of methylmercury through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations is also a known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders
ataxia can be induced as a result of severe acute radiation poisoning with an absorbed dose of more than graysfurthermore those with ataxia telangiectasia may have a high sensitivity towards gamma rays and x rays
vitamin b deficiency may cause among several neurological abnormalities overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia
neuropsychological symptoms may include sense loss difficulty in proprioception poor balance loss of sensation in the feet changes in reflexes dementia and psychosis can be reversible with treatment
complications may include a neurological complex known as subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord and other neurological disorders
symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with hypothyroidism
these include reversible cerebellar ataxia dementia peripheral neuropathy psychosis and coma
most of the neurological complications improve completely after thyroid hormone replacement therapy
peripheral neuropathies may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement
spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below when they involve the dorsal columns
non hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic alcohol use disorder head injury paraneoplastic and non paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia high altitude cerebral edema celiac disease normal pressure hydrocephalus and infectious or post infectious cerebellitis
ataxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum or of the spine most cases feature both to some extent and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia even though one is often more evident than the other
hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia episodic ataxia and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as friedreichs ataxia and niemann pick disease ataxia telangiectasia autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia and abetalipoproteinaemia
an example of x linked ataxic condition is the rare fragile x associated tremor ataxia syndrome or fxtas
arnold chiari malformation is a malformation of the brain
it consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla through the foramen magnum sometimes causing hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow
succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal recessive gene disorder where mutations in the aldha gene results in the accumulation of gamma hydroxybutyric acid in the body
ghb accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological dysfunction
wilsons disease is an autosomal recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the atpb gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body
copper accumulates in the liver and raises the toxicity levels in the nervous system causing demyelination of the nerves
this can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments
gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease derived from celiac disease which is triggered by the ingestion of gluten
early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression
the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible
it accounts for of ataxias of unknown origin and of all ataxias
less than of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom and only about have intestinal damage
this entity is classified into primary auto immune cerebellar ataxias
there is a continuum between presymptomatic ataxia and immune ataxias with clinical deficits
malfunction of the sodium potassium pump may be a factor in some ataxias
the pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar purkinje neurons
this suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic housekeeping molecule for ionic gradients but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain
indeed an ouabain block of pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia
ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations
antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase cause cerebellar deficits
the antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits
gad antibodies related ataxia is part of the group called immune mediated cerebellar ataxias
the antibodies induce a synaptopathy
the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to autoimmune disorders
cerebellar circuitry has capacities to compensate and restore function thanks to cerebellar reserve gathering multiple forms of plasticity
ltdpathies gather immune disorders targeting long term depression a form of plasticity
the treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause
treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely
recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition
a review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in
a small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical
diseases include vitamin e deficiency abetalipoproteinemia cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis niemann pick type c disease refsums disease glucose transporter type deficiency episodic ataxia type gluten ataxia glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia
novel therapies target the rna defects associated with cerebellar disorders using in particular anti sense oligonucleotides
the movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability
some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include hydroxytryptophan idebenone amantadine physostigmine l carnitine or derivatives trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole vigabatrin phosphatidylcholine acetazolamide aminopyridine buspirone and a combination of coenzyme q and vitamin e
physical therapy requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating motor learning for retraining specific functional motor patterns
a recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion
the most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation frenkel exercises proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and balance training however therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy
current research suggests that if a person is able to walk with or without a mobility aid physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components static balance dynamic balance trunk limb coordination stairs and contracture prevention
once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes
these outcomes include balance tasks gait and individual activities of daily living
while the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip or ankle joints it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain
decomposition simplification or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia
training likely needs to be intense and focused as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining
their therapy consisted of constraint induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function
treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking
gait aids can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination
severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a wheelchair
to obtain better results possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia
for example muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns
there are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia
the international cooperative ataxia rating scale is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity
other tools that assess motor function balance and coordination are also highly valuable to help the therapist track the progress of their patient as well as to quantify the patients functionality
these tests include but are not limited to the term ataxia is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process
examples include optic ataxia and ataxic respiration
optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement
outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord brain stem motor pathways pre motor and pre frontal cortex basal ganglia and the cerebellum
some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention
optic ataxia is usually part of balints syndrome but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule as it represents a disconnection between visual association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex
augusta ada king countess of lovelace was an english mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on charles babbages proposed mechanical general purpose computer the analytical engine
she was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation
ada byron was the only legitimate child of poet lord byron and reformer anne isabella milbanke
all lovelaces half siblings lord byrons other children were born out of wedlock to other women
byron separated from his wife a month after ada was born and left england forever
he died in greece when ada was eight
her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted adas interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her fathers perceived insanity
despite this ada remained interested in him naming her two sons byron and gordon
upon her death she was buried next to him at her request
although often ill in her childhood ada pursued her studies assiduously
she married william king in
king was made earl of lovelace in ada thereby becoming countess of lovelace
her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as andrew crosse charles babbage sir david brewster charles wheatstone and michael faraday and the author charles dickens contacts which she used to further her education
ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an analyst
when she was eighteen her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow british mathematician charles babbage who is known as the father of computers
she was in particular interested in babbages work on the analytical engine
lovelace first met him on june when she and her mother attended one of charles babbages saturday night soires with their mutual friend and adas private tutor mary somerville
between and ada translated by the military engineer luigi menabrea about the analytical engine supplementing it with
lovelaces notes are important in the early history of computers especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program that is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine
other historians reject this perspective and point out that babbages personal notes from to contain the first programs for the engine
she also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number crunching while many others including babbage himself focused only on those capabilities
her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the analytical engine examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool
the coding language ada is named for her
lord byron expected his child to be a glorious boy and was disappointed when lady byron gave birth to a girl
the child was named after byrons half sister augusta leigh and was called ada by byron himself
on january at lord byrons command lady byron left for her parents home at kirkby mallory taking their five week old daughter with her
although english law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation lord byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights but did request that his sister keep him informed of adas welfare
on april lord byron signed the deed of separation although very reluctantly and left england for good a few days later
aside from an acrimonious separation lady byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husbands immoral behaviour
this set of events made lovelace infamous in victorian society
ada did not have a relationship with her father
he died in when she was eight years old
her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life
lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her th birthday
lovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother
she was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother judith hon
lady milbanke who doted on her
however because of societal attitudes of the time which favoured the husband in any separation with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation lady byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society
this included writing anxious letters to lady milbanke about her daughters welfare with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern
in one letter to lady milbanke she referred to her daughter as it i talk to it for your satisfaction not my own and shall be very glad when you have it under your own
lady byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation
lovelace dubbed these observers the furies and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her
lovelace was often ill beginning in early childhood
at the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision
in june she was paralyzed after a bout of measles
she was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year something which may have extended her period of disability
by she was able to walk with crutches
despite the illnesses she developed her mathematical and technological skills
ada byron had an affair with a tutor in early
she tried to elope with him after she was caught but the tutors relatives recognised her and contacted her mother
lady byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal
lovelace never met her younger half sister allegra the daughter of lord byron and claire clairmont
allegra died in at the age of five
lovelace did have some contact with elizabeth medora leigh the daughter of byrons half sister augusta leigh who purposely avoided lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court
lovelace became close friends with her tutor mary somerville who introduced her to charles babbage in
she had a strong respect and affection for somerville and they corresponded for many years
other acquaintances included the scientists andrew crosse sir david brewster charles wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens
she was presented at court at the age of seventeen and became a popular belle of the season in part because of her brilliant mind
by ada was a regular at court and started attending various events
she danced often and was able to charm many people and was described by most people as being dainty although john hobhouse byrons friend described her as a large coarse skinned young woman but with something of my friends features particularly the mouth
this description followed their meeting on february in which ada made it clear to hobhouse that she did not like him probably due to her mothers influence which led her to dislike all of her fathers friends
this first impression was not to last and they later became friends
on july she married william th baron king becoming lady king
they had three homes ockham park surrey a scottish estate on loch torridon in ross shire and a house in london
they spent their honeymoon at ashley combe near porlock weir somerset which had been built as a hunting lodge in and was improved by king in preparation for their honeymoon
it later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time
from the familys main house was horsley towers built in the tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the houses of parliament charles barry and later greatly enlarged to lovelaces own designs
they had three children byron anne isabella and ralph gordon
immediately after the birth of annabella lady king experienced a tedious and suffering illness which took months to cure
ada was a descendant of the extinct barons lovelace and in her husband was made earl of lovelace and viscount ockham meaning ada became the countess of lovelace
in adas mother assigned william benjamin carpenter to teach adas children and to act as a moral instructor for ada
he quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an unbecoming manner
when it became clear that carpenter was trying to start an affair ada cut it off
in lovelace and medora leigh were told by adas mother that adas father was also medoras father
on february ada wrote to her mother i am not in the least astonished
in fact you merely confirm what i have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that i in any way suspected
she did not blame the incestuous relationship on byron but instead blamed augusta leigh i fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was
in the s ada flirted with scandals firstly from a relaxed approach to extra marital relationships with men leading to rumours of affairs and secondly from her love of gambling
she apparently lost more than on the horses during the later s
the gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends and an ambitious attempt in to create a mathematical model for successful large bets
this went disastrously wrong leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate forcing her to admit it all to her husband
she had a shadowy relationship with andrew crosses son john from onwards
john crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement
she bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her
during her final illness she would panic at the idea of the younger crosse being kept from visiting her
from when she was seventeen her mathematical abilities began to emerge and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life
her mothers obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused byron was one of the reasons that ada was taught mathematics from an early age
she was privately educated in mathematics and science by william frend william king and mary somerville the noted th century researcher and scientific author
in the s the mathematician augustus de morgan extended her much help in her mathematical studies including study of advanced calculus topics including the numbers of bernoulli
in a letter to lady byron de morgan suggested that adas skill in mathematics might lead her to become an original mathematical investigator perhaps of first rate eminence
lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science
whilst studying differential calculus she wrote to de morgan i may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight is i think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies
i am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of who are at ones elbows in one shape now and the next minute in a form most dissimilar
lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts
she valued metaphysics as much as mathematics viewing both as tools for exploring the unseen worlds around us
lovelace died at the age of on november from uterine cancer
the illness lasted several months in which time annabella took command over whom ada saw and excluded all of her friends and confidants
under her mothers influence ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making annabella her executor
she lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on august which caused him to abandon her bedside
it is not known what she told him
she was buried at her request next to her father at the church of st
mary magdalene in hucknall nottinghamshire
throughout her life lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day including phrenology and mesmerism
after her work with babbage lovelace continued to work on other projects
in she commented to a friend woronzow greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings
she never achieved this however
in part her interest in the brain came from a long running pre occupation inherited from her mother about her potential madness
as part of her research into this project she visited the electrical engineer andrew crosse in to learn how to carry out electrical experiments
in the same year she wrote a review of a paper by baron karl von reichenbach researches on magnetism but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft
in the year before her cancer struck she wrote to her mother mentioning certain productions she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music
lovelace first met charles babbage in june through their mutual friend mary somerville
later that month babbage invited lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine
she became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with somerville to visit babbage as often as she could
babbage was impressed by lovelaces intellect and analytic skills
he called her the enchantress of number
in he wrote to her during a nine month period in lovelace translated the italian mathematician luigi menabreas article on babbages newest proposed machine the analytical engine
with the article she appended a set of notes
explaining the analytical engines function was a difficult task many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the british establishment had shown little interest in it
lovelaces notes even had to explain how the analytical engine differed from the original difference engine
her work was well received at the time the scientist michael faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing
the notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include in complete detail a method for calculating a sequence of bernoulli numbers using the analytical engine which might have run correctly had it ever been built
based on this work lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer and her method has been called the worlds first computer program
others dispute this because some of charles babbages earlier writings could be considered computer programs
note g also contains lovelaces dismissal of artificial intelligence
she wrote that the analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything
it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform
it can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths
this objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal for example by alan turing in his paper computing machinery and intelligence
most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers
lovelace and babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement as an unsigned preface which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration
when taylors scientific memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed babbage wrote to lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper
this was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper
the historian benjamin woolley theorised that his actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought adas involvement and so happily indulged her
because of her celebrated name
their friendship recovered and they continued to correspond
on august when she was dying of cancer lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority
part of the terrace at worthy manor was known as philosophers walk it was there that lovelace and babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles
in babbage was invited to give a seminar at the university of turin about his analytical engine
luigi menabrea a young italian engineer and the future prime minister of italy transcribed babbages lecture into french and this transcript was subsequently published in the bibliothque universelle de genve in october
babbages friend charles wheatstone commissioned ada lovelace to translate menabreas paper into english
she then augmented the paper with notes which were added to the translation
ada lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this assisted with input from babbage
these notes which are more extensive than menabreas paper were then published in the september edition of taylors scientific memoirs under the initialism aal
ada lovelaces notes were labelled alphabetically from a to g
in note g she describes an algorithm for the analytical engine to compute bernoulli numbers
it is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer and ada lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason
the engine was never completed and so her program was never tested
in more than a century after her death ada lovelaces notes on babbages analytical engine were republished as an appendix to b
bowdens faster than thought a symposium on digital computing machines
the engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software
in her notes ada lovelace emphasised the difference between the analytical engine and previous calculating machines particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity
she realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching
in her notes she wrote this analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised
walter isaacson ascribes adas insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles when she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns it reminded her of how babbages engine used punched cards to make calculations
this insight is seen as significant by writers such as betty toole and benjamin woolley as well as the programmer john graham cumming whose project plan has the aim of constructing the first complete analytical engine
ada saw something that babbage in some sense failed to see
in babbages world his engines were bound by number
what lovelace saw
was that number could represent entities other than quantity
so once you had a machine for manipulating numbers if those numbers represented other things letters musical notes then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance according to rules
it is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation to general purpose computation and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing if we are looking and sifting history for that transition then that transition was made explicitly by ada in that paper
lovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism as covered in an article on the difference engine and the logical structure of the analytical engine on which the article she was reviewing dwelt
she noted that different specialists might be required in each area
the article chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative but giving in considerable length many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences
menabrea on the contrary exclusively developes the analytical view taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes but without attempting to explain how and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism
it is obvious that in the invention of a calculating engine these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation
they are indissolubly connected though so different in their intrinsic nature that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both
though lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer some biographers computer scientists and historians of computing suggest otherwise
allan g
bromley in the article difference and analytical engines bruce collier wrote that lovelace made a considerable contribution to publicizing the analytical engine but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way
eugene eric kim and betty alexandra toole consider it incorrect to regard lovelace as the first computer programmer as babbage wrote the initial programs for his analytical engine although the majority were never published
bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by babbage between and all substantially predating lovelaces notes
dorothy k
stein regards lovelaces notes as more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author the political purposes of the inventor and above all of the social and cultural context in which it was written than a blueprint for a scientific development
doron swade has said that ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities
in his book idea makers stephen wolfram defends lovelaces contributions
while acknowledging that babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the analytical engine prior to lovelaces notes wolfram argues that theres nothing as sophisticated or as clean as adas computation of the bernoulli numbers
babbage certainly helped and commented on adas work but she was definitely the driver of it
wolfram then suggests that lovelaces main achievement was to distill from babbages correspondence a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine something which babbage never did
the computer language ada created on behalf of the united states department of defense was named after lovelace

august william derleth was an american writer and anthologist
he was the first book publisher of the writings of h
he made contributions to the cthulhu mythos and the cosmic horror genre and helped found the publisher arkham house
derleth was also a leading american regional writer of his day as well as prolific in several other genres including historical fiction poetry detective fiction science fiction and biography
notably he created the fictional detective solar pons a pastiche of arthur conan doyles sherlock holmes
a guggenheim fellow derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious sac prairie saga a series of fiction historical fiction poetry and non fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the wisconsin he knew
derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing
the son of william julius derleth and rose louise volk derleth grew up in sauk city wisconsin
he was educated in local parochial and public high school
derleth wrote his first fiction at age
he was interested most in reading and he made three trips to the library a week
he would save his money to buy books
some of his biggest influences were ralph waldo emersons essays walt whitman h
menckens the american mercury samuel johnsons the history of rasselas prince of abissinia alexandre dumas edgar allan poe walter scott and henry david thoreaus walden
forty rejected stories and three years later according to anthologist jim stephens he sold his first story bats belfry to weird tales magazine in
derleth wrote throughout his four years at the university of wisconsin where he received a ba in
during this time he also served briefly as associate editor of minneapolis based fawcett publications mystic magazine
returning to sauk city in the summer of derleth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend mark schorer
they rented a cabin writing gothic and other horror stories and selling them to weird tales magazine
derleth won a place on the obrien roll of honor for five alone published in place of hawks but was first published in pagany magazine
as a result of his early work on the sac prairie saga derleth was awarded the prestigious guggenheim fellowship his sponsors were helen c
white nobel prize winning novelist sinclair lewis and poet edgar lee masters of spoon river anthology fame
in the mid s derleth organized a rangers club for young people served as clerk and president of the local school board served as a parole officer organized a local mens club and a parent teacher association
he also lectured in american regional literature at the university of wisconsin and was a contributing editor of outdoors magazine
with longtime friend donald wandrei derleth founded arkham house in
its initial objective was to publish the works of h
lovecraft with whom derleth had corresponded since his teenage years
at the same time he began teaching a course in american regional literature at the university of wisconsin
in he became literary editor of the capital times newspaper in madison a post he held until his resignation in
his hobbies included fencing swimming chess philately and comic strips
derleths true avocation however was hiking the terrain of his native wisconsin lands and observing and recording nature with an expert eye
derleth once wrote of his writing methods i write very swiftly from to a million words yearly very little of it pulp material
in he was elected president of the associated fantasy publishers at the th world science fiction convention in toronto
he was married april to sandra evelyn winters
they divorced six years later
derleth retained custody of the couples two children april rose derleth and walden william derleth
april earned a bachelor of arts degree in english from the university of wisconsin madison in
she became majority stockholder president and ceo of arkham house in
she remained in that capacity until her death
she was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian
april died on march
in derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called hawk and whippoorwill dedicated to poems of man and nature
derleth died of a heart attack on july and is buried in st
aloysius cemetery in sauk city
the us bridge over the wisconsin river is named in his honor
derleth was roman catholic
in derleths biography dorothy m
grobe litersky stated that derleth was bisexual and maintained long term romantic relationships with both men and women
this assertion has not been verified no names were given of these romantic partners and no evidence or acknowledgement of derleth having a bisexual or homosexual orientation has ever been found in his personal correspondence
however his novella the house of moonlight depicts a musicians personal crisis following a close relationship with a male cohabitant which undermines his professional confidence and subsequent relationships with women and ultimately results in a probable suicide a very common outcome of sexual identity questioning in novels of the time
derleth wrote more than short stories and more than books during his lifetime
derleth wrote an expansive series of novels short stories journals poems and other works about sac prairie
derleth intended this series to comprise up to novels telling the projected life story of the region from the th century onwards with analogies to balzacs human comedy and prousts remembrance of things past
this and other early work by derleth made him a well known figure among the regional literary figures of his time early pulitzer prize winners hamlin garland and zona gale as well as sinclair lewis the last both an admirer and critic of derleth
as edward wagenknecht wrote in cavalcade of the american novel what mr derleth has that is lacking
in modern novelists generally is a country
he belongs
he writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
in his fictional world there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology
it is clear too that he did not get the best and most fictionally useful part of his background material from research in the library like scott in his border novels he gives rather the impression of having drunk it in with his mothers milk
jim stephens editor of an august derleth reader argues what derleth accomplished
was to gather a wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life
the author inaugurated the sac prairie saga with four novellas comprising place of hawks published by loring mussey in
at publication the detroit news wrote certainly with this book mr derleth may be added to the american writers of distinction
derleths first novel still is the summer night was published two years later by the famous charles scribners editor maxwell perkins and was the second in his sac prairie saga
village year the first in a series of journals meditations on nature midwestern village american life and more was published in to praise from the new york times book review a book of instant sensitive responsiveness
recreates its scene with acuteness and beauty and makes an unusual contribution to the americana of the present day
the new york herald tribune observed that derleth
deepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background with the people projected against this the writing comes to have the quality of an old flemish picture humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond
james grey writing in the st
louis dispatch concluded derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the spoon river anthology
in the same year evening in spring was published by charles scribners sons
this work derleth considered among his finest
what the milwaukee journal called this beautiful little love story is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small town religious bigotry
the work received critical praise the new yorker considered it a story told with tenderness and charm while the chicago tribune concluded its as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told with rekindled emotion of the pangs of pain and the sharp clear sweetness of a boys first love
helen constance white wrote in the capital times that it was
the best articulated the most fully disciplined of his stories
these were followed in with shadow of night a scribners novel of which the chicago sun wrote structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel
a psychological novel of the first order and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting
in november however derleths work was attacked by his one time admirer and mentor sinclair lewis
writing in esquire lewis observed it is a proof of mr derleths merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular avalon the wisconsin river shining among its islands and the castles of baron pierneau and hercules dousman
he is a champion and a justification of regionalism
yet he is also a burly bounding bustling self confident opinionated and highly sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues
if he could ever be persuaded that he isnt half as good as he thinks he is if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil he might become twice as good as he thinks he is which would about rank him with homer
derleth good humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater on the back cover of his country journal village daybook
a lighter side to the sac prairie saga is a series of quasi autobiographical short stories known as the gus elker stories amusing tales of country life that peter ruber derleths last editor said were
models of construction and
fused with some of the most memorable characters in american literature
most were written between and the late s though the last tail of the dog was published in and won the scholastic magazine short story award for the year
the series was collected and republished in country matters in
walden west published in is considered by many derleths finest work
this prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of sac prairie journals but is organized around three themes the persistence of memory
the sounds and odors of the country
and thoreaus observation that the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation
a blend of nature writing philosophic musings and careful observation of the people and place of sac prairie
of this work george vukelich author of north country notebook writes derleths walden west is
the equal of sherwood andersons winesburgohio thornton wilders our town and edgar lee masters spoon river anthology
this was followed eight years later by return to walden west a work of similar quality but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing notes critic norbert blei
a close literary relative of the sac prairie saga was derleths wisconsin saga which comprises several historical novels
detective fiction represented another substantial body of derleths work
most notable among this work was a series of stories in affectionate pastiche of sherlock holmes whose creator sir arthur conan doyle he admired greatly
the stories feature a holmes styled british detective named solar pons of b praed street in london
these included one published novel as well
the series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as ellery queen anthony boucher vincent starrett and howard haycraft
in his volume the misadventures of sherlock holmes ellery queen wrote of derleths the norcross riddle an early pons story how many budding authors not even old enough to vote could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity queen adds his choice of the euphonic solar pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of sherlockian nomenclature
vincent starrett in his foreword to the edition of the casebook of solar pons wrote that the series is as sparkling a galaxy of sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end
despite close similarities to doyles creation pons lived in the post world war i era in the decades of the s and s
though derleth never wrote a pons novel to equal the hound of the baskervilles editor peter ruber wrote that derleth produced more than a few solar pons stories almost as good as sir arthurs and many that had better plot construction
although these stories were a form of diversion for derleth ruber who edited the original text solar pons omnibus edition argued because the stories were generally of such high quality they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery fiction rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of sherlock holmes
some of the stories were self published through a new imprint called mycroft moran an appellation of humorous significance to holmesian scholars
for approximately a decade an active supporting group was the praed street irregulars patterned after the baker street irregulars
in conan doyles two sons made some attempts to force derleth to cease publishing the solar pons series but the efforts were unsuccessful and were eventually withdrawn
derleths mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in sac prairie and featuring judge peck as the central character
derleth wrote many and varied childrens works including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer jacques marquette as well as ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau
arguably most important among his works for younger readers however is the steve and sim mystery series also known as the mill creek irregulars series
the ten volume series published between and is set in sac prairie of the s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the sac prairie saga as well as an extension of derleths body of mystery fiction
robert hood writing in the new york times said steve and sim the major characters are twentieth century cousins of huck finn and tom sawyer derleths minor characters little gems of comic drawing
the first novel in the series the moon tenders does in fact involve a rafting adventure down the wisconsin river which led regional writer jesse stuart to suggest the novel was one that older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth
the connection to the sac prairie saga was noted by the chicago tribune once again a small midwest community in s is depicted with perception skill and dry humor
derleth was a correspondent and friend of h
lovecraft when lovecraft wrote about le comte derlette in his fiction it was in homage to derleth
derleth invented the term cthulhu mythos to describe the fictional universe depicted in the series of stories shared by lovecraft and other writers in his circle
when lovecraft died in derleth and donald wandrei assembled a collection of lovecrafts stories and tried to get them published
existing publishers showed little interest so derleth and wandrei founded arkham house in for that purpose
the name of the company derived from lovecrafts fictional town of arkham massachusetts which features in many of his stories
in arkham house published the outsider and others a huge collection that contained most of lovecrafts known short stories
derleth and wandrei soon expanded arkham house and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book someone in the dark a collection of some of derleths own horror stories was published in
following lovecrafts death derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by lovecraft
these were published in weird tales and later in book form under the byline h
lovecraft and august derleth with derleth calling himself a posthumous collaborator
this practice has raised objections in some quarters that derleth simply used lovecrafts name to market what was essentially his own fiction s
joshi refers to the posthumous collaborations as marking the beginning of perhaps the most disreputable phase of derleths activities
dirk w
mosig s
joshi and richard l
tierney were dissatisfied with derleths invention of the term cthulhu mythos and his presentation of lovecrafts fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting derleths own christian world view which they contrast with lovecrafts depiction of an amoral universe
however robert m
price points out that while derleths tales are distinct from lovecrafts in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil nevertheless the basis of derlerths systemization are found in lovecraft
he also suggests that the differences can be overstated derleth was more optimistic than lovecraft in his conception of the mythos but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind
there are indeed tales wherein derleths protagonists get off scot free but often the hero is doomed as in lovecraft
and it must be remembered that an occasional lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds eg in the horror in the museum the shunned house and the case of charles dexter ward
derleth also treated lovecrafts great old ones as representatives of elemental forces creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework
such debates aside derleths founding of arkham house and his successful effort to rescue lovecraft from literary oblivion are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field
for instance ramsey campbell has acknowledged derleths encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career and kirby mccauley has cited derleth and arkham house as an inspiration for his own anthology dark forces
arkham house and derleth published dark carnival the first book by ray bradbury as well
brian lumley cites the importance of derleth to his own lovecraftian work and contends in a introduction to derleths work that he was
one of the first finest and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction
important as was derleths work to rescue hp lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of lovecrafts death derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own still frequently anthologized
the best of this work recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories most of which were originally published in weird tales illustrates derleths original abilities in the genre
while derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts the compilers of these four anthologies including ramsey campbell note that the stories still resonate after more than years
in the library of america selected derleths story the panelled room for inclusion in its two century retrospective of american fantastic tales
derleth also wrote many historical novels as part of both the sac prairie saga and the wisconsin saga
he also wrote history arguably most notable among these was the wisconsin river of a thousand isles published in
the work was one in a series entitled the rivers of america conceived by writer constance lindsay skinner during the great depression as a series that would connect americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation
skinner wanted the series to be written by artists not academicians
derleth while not a trained historian was according to former wisconsin state historian william f
a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals
in the foreword to the reissue of the work by the university of wisconsin press thompson concluded no other writer of whatever background or training knew and understood his particular corner of the earth better than august derleth
additionally derleth wrote a number of volumes of poetry
three of his collections rind of earth selected poems and the edge of night were published by the decker press which also printed the work of other midwestern poets such as edgar lee masters
derleth was also the author of several biographies of other writers including zona gale ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau
he also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early th century comics such as buster brown little nemo in slumberland and katzenjammer kids as well as a book of childrens poetry entitled a boys way and the foreword to tales from an indian lodge by phebe jewell nichols
derleth also wrote under the pen names stephen grendon kenyon holmes and tally mason
derleths papers were donated to the wisconsin historical society in madison
the alps are one of the highest and most extensive mountain ranges in europe stretching approximately across eight alpine countries monaco france switzerland italy liechtenstein germany austria and slovenia
the alpine arch extends from nice on the western mediterranean to trieste on the adriatic and vienna at the beginning of the pannonian basin
the mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the african and eurasian tectonic plates collided
extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as mont blanc and the matterhorn
mont blanc spans the french italian border and at is the highest mountain in the alps
the alpine region area contains peaks higher than list of alpine four thousanders
the altitude and size of the range affect the climate in europe in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones
wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of and plants such as edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations
evidence of human habitation in the alps goes back to the palaeolithic era
a mummified man determined to be years old was discovered on a glacier at the austrian italian border in
by the th century bc the celtic la tne culture was well established
hannibal notably crossed the alps with a herd of elephants and the romans had settlements in the region
in napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of
the th and th centuries saw an influx of naturalists writers and artists in particular the romanticists followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks of the alps
the alpine region has a strong cultural identity
traditional practices such as farming cheesemaking and woodworking still thrive in alpine villages
however the tourist industry began to grow early in the th century and expanded significantly after world war ii eventually becoming the dominant industry by the end of the century
the winter olympic games have been hosted in the swiss french italian austrian and german alps
the region is home to million people and has million annual visitors
the english word alps comes from the latin alpes
the latin word could possibly come from the adjective or could possibly come from the greek goddess alphito whose name is related to alphita the white flour alphos a dull white leprosy and finally the proto indo european word
similarly the river god alpheus is also supposed to derive from the greek alphos and means whitish
in his commentary on the aeneid of virgil the late fourth century grammarian maurus servius honoratus says that all high mountains are called alpes by celts
according to the oxford english dictionary the latin alpes might derive from a pre indo european word alb hill albania is a related derivation
albania a name not native to the region known as the country of albania has been used as a name for several mountainous areas across europe
in roman times albania was a name for the eastern caucasus while in the english languages albania was occasionally used as a name for scotland although it is more likely derived from the latin word the colour white
in modern languages the term alp alm albe or alpe refers to a grazing pastures in the alpine regions below the glaciers not the peaks
an alp refers to a high mountain pasture typically near or above the tree line where cows and other livestock are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where huts and hay barns can be found sometimes constituting tiny hamlets
therefore the term the alps as a reference to the mountains is a misnomer
the term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language words such as horn kogel kopf gipfel spitze stock and berg are used in german speaking regions mont pic tte pointe dent roche and aiguille in french speaking regions and monte picco corno punta pizzo or cima in italian speaking regions
the alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central europe that ranges in an arc from east to west and is in width
the mean height of the mountain peaks is
the range stretches from the mediterranean sea north above the po basin extending through france from grenoble and stretching eastward through mid and southern switzerland
the range continues onward toward vienna austria and southeast to the adriatic sea and slovenia
to the south it dips into northern italy and to the north extends to the southern border of bavaria in germany
in areas like chiasso switzerland and allgu bavaria the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear in other places such as geneva the demarcation is less clear
the alps are found in the following countries austria italy france switzerland germany slovenia liechtenstein and monaco
the highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the rhne valley from mont blanc to the matterhorn and monte rosa on the southern side and the bernese alps on the northern
the peaks in the easterly portion of the range in austria and slovenia are smaller than those in the central and western portions
the variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the alps make classification of the mountains and subregions difficult but a general classification is that of the eastern alps and western alps with the divide between the two occurring in eastern switzerland according to geologist stefan schmid near the splgen pass
the highest peaks of the western alps and eastern alps respectively are mont blanc at and piz bernina at
the second highest major peaks are monte rosa at and ortler at respectively
a series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the alps including the french prealps in france and the jura mountains in switzerland and france
the secondary chain of the alps follows the watershed from the mediterranean sea to the wienerwald passing over many of the highest and most well known peaks in the alps
from the colle di cadibona to col de tende it runs westwards before turning to the northwest and then near the colle della maddalena to the north
upon reaching the swiss border the line of the main chain heads approximately east northeast a heading it follows until its end near vienna
the northeast end of the alpine arc directly on the danube which flows into the black sea is the leopoldsberg near vienna
in contrast the southeastern part of the alps ends on the adriatic sea in the area around trieste towards duino and barcola
the alps have been crossed for war and commerce and by pilgrims students and tourists
crossing routes by road train or foot are known as passes and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre mountainous zones
in the medieval period hospices were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes
the most important passes are the col de liseran the col agnel the brenner pass the mont cenis the great st
bernard pass the col de tende the gotthard pass the semmering pass the simplon pass and the stelvio pass
crossing the italian austrian border the brenner pass separates the tztal alps and zillertal alps and has been in use as a trading route since the th century
the lowest of the alpine passes at the semmering crosses from lower austria to styria since the th century when a hospice was built there it has seen continuous use
a railroad with a tunnel long was built along the route of the pass in the mid th century
with a summit of the great st bernard pass is one of the highest in the alps crossing the italian swiss border east of the pennine alps along the flanks of mont blanc
the pass was used by napoleon bonaparte to cross troops in
the mont cenis pass has been a major commercial and military road between western europe and italy
the pass was crossed by many troops on their way to the italian peninsula
from constantine i pepin the short and charlemagne to henry iv napolon and more recently the german gebirgsjgers during world war ii
now the pass has been supplanted by the frjus highway tunnel and rail tunnel
the saint gotthard pass crosses from central switzerland to ticino in the saint gotthard railway tunnel was opened connecting lucerne in switzerland with milan in italy
years later followed gotthard road tunnel connecting the a motorway in gschenen on the north side with airolo on the south side exactly like the railway tunnel
on june the worlds longest railway tunnel the gotthard base tunnel was opened which connects erstfeld in canton of uri with bodio in canton of ticino by two single tubes of
it is the first tunnel that traverses the alps on a flat route
from december it has been part of the regular railway timetable and used hourly as standard ride between basel lucerne zrich and bellinzona lugano milan
the highest pass in the alps is the col de liseran in savoy at followed by the stelvio pass in northern italy at the road was built in the s
the union internationale des associations dalpinisme has defined a list of official alpine summits that reach at least
the list includes not only mountains but also subpeaks with little prominence that are considered important mountaineering objectives
below are listed the four thousanders with at least of prominence
while mont blanc was first climbed in and the jungfrau in most of the alpine four thousanders were climbed during the second half of the th century notably piz bernina the dom the grand combin the weisshorn and the barre des crins the ascent of the matterhorn in marked the end of the golden age of alpinism
karl blodig was among the first to successfully climb all the major m peaks
he completed his series of ascents in
many of the big alpine three thousanders were climbed in the early th century notably the grossglockner and the ortler although some of them were climbed only much later such at mont pelvoux monte viso and la meije
the first british mont blanc ascent by a man was in the first ascent by a woman was in
by the mid s swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides
edward whymper reached the top of the matterhorn in and in the last of the six great north faces of the alps was climbed with the first ascent of the eiger nordwand
important geological concepts were established as naturalists began studying the rock formations of the alps in the th century
in the mid th century the now defunct idea of geosynclines was used to explain the presence of folded mountain chains
this theory was replaced in the mid th century by the theory of plate tectonics
the formation of the alps was an episodic process that began about million years ago
in the paleozoic era the pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate it broke into separate plates during the mesozoic era and the tethys sea developed between laurasia and gondwana during the jurassic period
the tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the alpide belt from gibraltar through the himalayas to indonesia a process that began at the end of the mesozoic and continues into the present
the formation of the alps was a segment of this orogenic process caused by the collision between the african and the eurasian plates that began in the late cretaceous period
under extreme compressive stresses and pressure marine sedimentary rocks were uplifted forming characteristic recumbent folds and thrust faults
as the rising peaks underwent erosion a layer of marine flysch sediments was deposited in the foreland basin and the sediments became involved in younger folds as the orogeny progressed
coarse sediments from the continual uplift and erosion were later deposited in foreland areas north of the alps
these regions in switzerland and bavaria are well developed containing classic examples of flysch which is sedimentary rock formed during mountain building
the alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the paleogene causing differences in folded structures with a late stage orogeny causing the development of the jura mountains
a series of tectonic events in the triassic jurassic and cretaceous periods caused different paleogeographic regions
the alps are subdivided by different lithology and nappe structures according to the orogenic events that affected them
the geological subdivision differentiates the western eastern alps and southern alps the helveticum in the north the penninicum and austroalpine system in the centre and south of the periadriatic seam the southern alpine system
according to geologist stefan schmid because the western alps underwent a metamorphic event in the cenozoic era while the austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the cretaceous period the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations
flysch deposits in the southern alps of lombardy probably occurred in the cretaceous or later
peaks in france italy and switzerland lie in the houillire zone which consists of basement with sediments from the mesozoic era
high massifs with external sedimentary cover are more common in the western alps and were affected by neogene period thin skinned thrusting whereas the eastern alps have comparatively few high peaked massifs
similarly the peaks in eastern switzerland extending to western austria consist of thin skinned sedimentary folding that detached from former basement rock
in simple terms the structure of the alps consists of layers of rock of european african and oceanic origin
the bottom nappe structure is of continental european origin above which are stacked marine sediment nappes topped off by nappes derived from the african plate
the matterhorn is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding
the tip of the mountain consists of gneisses from the african plate the base of the peak below the glaciated area consists of european basement rock
the sequence of tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the african and european plates
the core regions of the alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion produced the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the swiss alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas
peaks such as mont blanc the matterhorn and high peaks in the pennine alps the brianonnais and hohe tauern consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock
due to the ever present geologic instability earthquakes continue in the alps to this day
typically the largest earthquakes in the alps have been between magnitude and on the richter scale
geodetic measurements show ongoing topographic uplift at rates of up to about mm per year in the north western and central alps and at mm per year in the eastern and south western alps
the underlying mechanisms that jointly drive the present day uplift pattern are the isostatic rebound due to the melting of the last glacial maximum ice cap or long term erosion detachment of the western alpine subducting slab mantle convection as well as ongoing horizontal convergence between africa and europe but their relative contributions to the uplift of the alps are difficult to quantify and likely to vary significantly in space and time
the alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years
in the th to th centuries bc during the hallstatt culture celtic tribes mined copper later the romans mined gold for coins in the bad gastein area
erzberg in styria furnishes high quality iron ore for the steel industry
crystals such as cinnabar amethyst and quartz are found throughout much of the alpine region
the cinnabar deposits in slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments
alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years and began to be classified in the th century
leonhard euler studied the shapes of crystals and by the th century crystal hunting was common in alpine regions
david friedrich wiser amassed a collection of crystals that he studied and documented
in the th century robert parker wrote a well known work about the rock crystals of the swiss alps at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of alpine minerals
in the miocene epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation which was noted in the mid th century by naturalist louis agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the alps were covered in ice at various intervals a theory he formed when studying rocks near his neuchtel home which he believed originated to the west in the bernese oberland
because of his work he came to be known as the father of the ice age concept although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas
agassiz studied glacier movement in the s at the unteraar glacier where he found the glacier moved per year more rapidly in the middle than at the edges
his work was continued by other scientists and now a permanent laboratory exists inside a glacier under the jungfraujoch devoted exclusively to the study of alpine glaciers
glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow
this causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time
the inn valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion
eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages
glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys
moraines piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier accumulate at edges centre and the terminus of glaciers
alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice long sweeping rivers spread in a fan like shape and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks
the stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period
the cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous crevasses often invisible under new snowfall which causes the greatest danger to mountaineers
glaciers end in ice caves by trailing into a lake or river or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow
sometimes a piece of glacier will detach or break resulting in flooding property damage and loss of life
high levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to permafrost levels in some areas whereas in other more arid regions glaciers remain above about the level
the of the alps covered by glaciers in had shrunk to by resulting in decreased river run off levels
forty percent of the glaciation in austria has disappeared since and of that in switzerland
although the alpine topography shows marked glacial morphologies the mechanisms by which glacial reshaping occurs are unclear
numerical modeling suggests that glacial erosion propagates from low elevations to high elevations leading to an early increase of local relief followed by lowering of the mean orogen elevation
the alps provide lowland europe with drinking water irrigation and hydroelectric power
although the area is only about of the surface area of europe the alps provide up to of water to lowland europe particularly to arid areas and during the summer months
cities such as milan depend on of water from alpine runoff
water from the rivers is used in at least hydroelectricity power plants considering only those producing at least mw of electricity
major european rivers flow from the alps such as the rhine the rhne the inn and the po all of which have headwaters in the alps and flow into neighbouring countries finally emptying into the north sea the mediterranean sea the adriatic sea and the black sea
other rivers such as the danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the alps
the rhne is second to the nile as a freshwater source to the mediterranean sea the river begins as glacial meltwater flows into lake geneva and from there to france where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants
the rhine originates in a area in switzerland and represents almost of water exported from the country
tributary valleys some of which are complicated channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snowmelt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers
the rivers form lakes such as lake geneva a crescent shaped lake crossing the swiss border with lausanne on the swiss side and the town of evian les bains on the french side
in germany the medieval st
bartholomews chapel was built on the south side of the knigssee accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks
additionally the alps have led to the creation of large lakes in italy
for instance the sarca the primary inflow of lake garda originates in the italian alps
the italian lakes are a popular tourist destination since the roman era for their mild climate
scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use
for example each year more water is diverted from rivers for snowmaking in the ski resorts the effect of which is yet unknown
furthermore the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower than expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands
the alps are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher elevation terrain
elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called alpine
a rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease
the effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain
the height of the alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in europe into a wet north and dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks
the severe weather in the alps has been studied since the th century particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind
numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early th century providing continuous data for climatologists
some of the valleys are quite arid such as the aosta valley in italy the maurienne in france the valais in switzerland and northern tyrol
the areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff
the mean precipitation in the alps ranges from a low of per year to per year with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes
at altitudes between snowfall begins in november and accumulates through to april or may when the melt begins
snow lines vary from above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during july and august
high water levels in streams and rivers peak in june and july when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes
the alps are split into five climatic zones each with different vegetation
the climate plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains
the lowest zone is the colline zone which exists between depending on the location
the montane zone extends from followed by the sub alpine zone from
the alpine zone extending from tree line to the snow line is followed by the glacial zone which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain
climatic conditions show variances within the same zones for example weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley extending directly from the peaks are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall
various models of climate change have been projected into the nd century for the alps with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall snowpack glaciation and river runoff
significant changes of both natural and anthropogenic origins have already been diagnosed from observations including a reduction per decade in snow cover duration over the last years which also highlights climate change adaptation needs due to impacts on the climate and regional socio economic activities
thirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the alpine regions
alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be limestone or non calcareous
the habitats range from meadows bogs and woodland areas to soil less scree and moraines and rock faces and ridges
a natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief deciduous trees oak beech ash and sycamore maple
these do not reach the same elevation nor are they often found growing together but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation
this limit usually lies about above the sea on the north side of the alps but on the southern slopes it often rises to sometimes even to
above the forestry there is often a band of dwarf pine trees which is in turn superseded by alpenrosen dwarf shrubs typically rhododendron ferrugineum or rhododendron hirsutum
although alpenrose prefers acidic soil the plants are found throughout the region
above the tree line is the area defined as alpine where in the alpine meadow plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures aridity and high altitudes
the alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines
alpine plants such as the alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the lauterbrunnental
gentians are named after the illyrian king gentius and species of the early spring blooming flower grow in the alps in a range of
writing about the gentians in switzerland d
lawrence described them as darkening the day time torch like with the smoking blueness of plutos gloom
gentians tend to appear repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys
on the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer
at these higher altitudes the plants tend to form isolated cushions
in the alps several species of flowering plants have been recorded above including ranunculus glacialis androsace alpina and saxifraga biflora
eritrichium nanum commonly known as the king of the alps is the most elusive of the alpine flowers growing on rocky ridges at
perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is edelweiss which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as and as high as
the plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds
the extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with secondary metabolites important for medicinal purposes
origanum vulgare prunella vulgaris solanum nigrum and urtica dioica are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the alps
human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas and except for the beech forests of the austrian alps forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the th and th centuries
the vegetation has changed since the second half of the th century as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of the forest
in some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non skiing months whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers
the alps are a habitat for species of wildlife ranging from the tiniest snow fleas to brown bears many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro climates either directly above or below the snow line
the largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex which have been sighted as high as
the ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses
classified as antelopes chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the alps living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range
areas of the eastern alps are still home to brown bears
in switzerland the canton of bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in above kleine scheidegg by three hunters from grindelwald
many rodents such as voles live underground
marmots live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as
they hibernate in large groups to provide warmth and can be found in all areas of the alps in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures
golden eagles and bearded vultures are the largest birds to be found in the alps they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of
the most common bird is the alpine chough which can be found scavenging at climbers huts or the jungfraujoch a high altitude tourist destination
reptiles such as adders and vipers live up to the snow line because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges
the high altitude alpine salamanders have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs
brown trout can be found in the streams up to the snow line
molluscs such as the wood snail live up the snow line
popularly gathered as food the snails are now protected
several species of moths live in the alps some of which are believed to have evolved in the same habitat up to million years ago long before the alps were created
blue butterflies can commonly be seen drinking from the snowmelt some species of blues fly as high as
the butterflies tend to be large such as those from the swallowtail parnassius family with a habitat that ranges to
twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is rosalia alpina
spiders such as the large wolf spider live above the snow line and can be seen as high as
scorpions can be found in the italian alps
some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the alpine orogeny
in mosson in valais switzerland dinosaur tracks were found in the s dating probably from the triassic period
when the ice melted after the wrm glaciation paleolithic settlements were established along the lake shores and in cave systems
evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near the vercors cave system close to grenoble and echirolles
in austria the mondsee lake shows evidence of houses built on piles
standing stones have been found in the alpine areas of france and italy
about drawings and etchings have been documented and are known as the rock drawings in valcamonica
a mummy of a neolithic human known as tzi was discovered on the similaun
his clothing lets modern people assume that he was an alpine farmer while the location and manner of his death suggests that tzi was traveling
analysis of the mitochondrial dna of tzi has shown that he belongs to the k subclade
from the th to the th century bc much of the alps was settled by the germanic peoples lombards alemanni bavarii and franks
celt tribes settled in modern day switzerland between and bc
the raeti lived in the eastern regions while the west was occupied by the helvetii and the allobroges settled in the rhne valley and in savoy
the ligures and adriatic veneti lived in northwest italy and triveneto respectively
the celts mined salt in areas such as salzburg where evidence was found of the hallstatt culture
by the th century bc the la tne culture was well established in the region and became known for high quality celtic art
between and bc prolonged warfare in the alps resulted in the devastation of agricultural land and human settlements ultimately triggering the enslavement of men women and children goods had to be imported as a result
the etruscan civilization responded to raids by the massalia and acquired absolute control over the alpine trade routes
aggressors in modern day italy were dealt with and an alliance was formed with the celts
the grip of the etruscan settlements broke down as the roman political system expanded so as to take control over alpine trade routes that connected human settlements in the alps with settlements in the mediterranean
during the second punic war in bc the carthage general hannibal initiated one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare recorded as hannibal crossing the alps
the roman people built roads along the alpine mountain passes which continued to be used through the medieval period
roman road markers can still be found on the alpine mountain passes
during the gallic wars in bc julius caesar defeated the helvetii
the rhaetian continued to resist but their territory was eventually conquered when the romans crossed the danube valley and defeated the brigantes
the romans built settlements in the alps
in towns such as aosta martigny lausanne and partenkirchen remains of villas arenas and temples have been discovered
christianity was established in the alps by the roman people
monasteries and churches were constructed even at high alpine altitudes
the franks expanded their carolingian empire while the baiuvarii introduced feudalism in the eastern alps
the construction of castles in the alps supported the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms
castello del buonconsiglio in trento still has intricate frescoes and excellent examples of gothic art
the chteau de chillon is preserved as an example of medieval architecture
there are several important alpine saints and one such one is saint maurice
much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the house of savoy the visconti of milan and the house of habsburg
the great st bernard hospice built in the th or th centuries at the summit of the great saint bernard pass was a shelter for humans and destination for pilgrims
in to protect themselves from incursions by the house of habsburg four alpine cantons drew up the federal charter of which is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms
after a series of battles fought in the th th and th centuries more cantons joined the confederacy and by the th century switzerland was established as a sovereign state
in the alps the war of the spanish succession fallout resulted in a treaty part of the peace of utrecht which relocated the western alps border along the watersheds
historically the alps were used to determine the borders of political and administrative gangs but the peace of utrecht was the first significant body of treaty that considered geographical conditions
the alps were carved up and borders were agreed so that enclaves in the alps could be eliminated
during the napoleonic wars in the late th century and early th century napoleon annexed territory formerly controlled by the house of habsburg and the house of savoy
in the helvetic republic was established two years later an army across the great st bernard pass
in the russian imperial military engaged the revolutionary french army in the alps this episode has been recorded as significant achievement in mountain warfare
in october the troops commanded by alexander suvorov were surrounded in the alps by much larger french troops
the russian troops broke out mauled the french troops and retreated through the panix pass
after the fall of napoleon many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent further invasion
thus savoy built a series of fortifications to protect the major alpine passes such as the col du mont cenis which was crossed by charlemagne to obliterate the lombards
in the th century the monasteries built in the alps to shelter humans became tourist destinations
the benedictines had built monasteries in lucerne and oberammergau
the cistercians built their temple at lake constance
meanwhile the augustinians maintained abbeys in savoy and one in interlaken
radiocarbon dated charcoal placed around years ago was found in the drachloch cave above the village of vattis in the canton of st
gallen proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people
seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people
the peaks however were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys
the mountain peaks were seen as terrifying the abode of dragons and demons to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the alpine passes
the glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons
charles vii of france ordered his chamberlain to climb mont aiguille in
the knight reached the summit of rocciamelone where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice
in antoine de ville climbed mont aiguille without reaching the summit an experience he described as horrifying and terrifying
leonardo da vinci was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes and climbed a mountain scholars are uncertain which one some believe it may have been monte rosa
from his description of a blue like that of a gentian sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude
in the th century four chamonix men almost made the summit of mont blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness
conrad gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the th century to study them writing that in the mountains he found the theatre of the lord
by the th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore study and conquer the high peaks
two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were horace bndict de saussure in the pennine alps and the benedictine monk of disentis placidus a spescha
born in geneva saussure was enamoured with the mountains from an early age he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the bernese oberland the savoy the piedmont and valais studying the glaciers and geology as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval
saussure in was a member of the third ascent of mont blanc today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed
albrecht von hallers poem die alpen published in described the mountains as an area of mythical purity
jean jacques rousseau presented the alps as a place of allure and beauty in his novel julie or the new heloise published in
later the first wave of romanticism such as johann wolfgang von goethe and j
turner came to admire the alpine scenery wordsworth visited the area in writing of his experiences in the prelude
schiller later wrote the play william tell which tells the story of the legendary swiss marksman william tell as part of the greater swiss struggle for independence from the habsburg empire in the early th century
at the end of the napoleonic wars the alpine countries began to see an influx of poets artists and musicians as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature
in byron percy bysshe shelley and his wife mary shelley visited geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings
during these visits shelley wrote the poem mont blanc byron wrote the prisoner of chillon and the dramatic poem manfred and mary shelley who found the scenery overwhelming conceived the idea for the novel frankenstein in her villa on the shores of lake geneva amid a thunderstorm
when coleridge travelled to chamonix he declaimed in defiance of shelley who had signed himself atheos in the guestbook of the hotel de londres near montenvers who would be who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders
by the mid th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region
from the beginning of the th century the tourism and mountaineering development of the alps began
in the early years of the golden age of alpinism initially scientific activities were mixed with sport for example by the physicist john tyndall with the first ascent of the matterhorn by edward whymper being the highlight
in the later years the silver age of alpinism the focus was on mountain sports and climbing
the first president of the alpine club john ball is considered the discoverer of the dolomites which for decades were the focus of climbers like paul grohmann michael innerkofler and angelo dibona
in autumn adolf hitler commissioned the first of a series of refurbishments which eventually turned a mountain cottage later named berghof into a fortified citadel
this domestic but representative fortification had two small bedrooms and a full bathroom planned by the munich architect and nsdap member josef neumaier
guests such as rudolf hess stayed over sleeping in tents or over the garage
the alps adolf hitler and improbable powerful organizations have been subject to crime fiction
the alps acted as a geographical barrier to italy and the alps for centuries were permeated with established smuggling routes known as green line
after world war ii members of the schutzstaffel that feared prosecution as war criminals known in modern english only as ss disappeared into a crowd of refugees
massive numbers of refugees entered italy illegally by navigating the alps
smugglers of humans claim that crossing the alps is less dangerous or deadly than traveling km on water between tripoli and lampedusa with a tramp ship or a dinghy
undocumented migrants visa overstayers false tourists asylum seekers and other clandestine humans lose their lives crossing the alps
the exact number of smuggled humans who die a brutal death in the alps can only be estimated
the largest city within the alps is the city of grenoble in france
other larger and important cities within the alps with over inhabitants are in tyrol with bolzano bozen trento and innsbruck
larger cities outside the alps are milan verona turin munich graz vienna salzburg ljubljana maribor kranj zrich geneva nice and lyon
the population of the region is million spread across eight countries
on the rim of the mountains on the plateaus and on the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and the mountains farming is still essential to the economy
farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of alpine culture industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology
the alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse
dialects are common and vary from valley to valley and region to region
in the slavic alps alone dialects have been identified
some of the romance dialects spoken in the french swiss and italian alps of aosta valley derive from arpitan while the southern part of the western range is related to occitan the german dialects derive from germanic tribal languages
romansh spoken by two percent of the population in southeast switzerland is an ancient rhaeto romanic language derived from latin remnants of ancient celtic languages and perhaps etruscan
much of the alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and the highest villages became mainstays leading to strong traditions of carpentry woodcarving baking pastry making and cheesemaking
farming has been a traditional occupation for centuries although it became less dominant in the th century with the advent of tourism
grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the alps
in mid june cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers
villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid september
the almabtrieb alpabzug alpabfahrt dsalpes is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous cowbells while the farmers dress in traditional costumes
cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most alpine countries
a wheel of cheese from the emmental in switzerland can weigh up to and the beaufort in savoy can weigh up to
owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion about the proportion of the cows milk from the summer months in the high alps
haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages that have become somewhat mechanized in recent years although the slopes are so steep that scythes are usually necessary to cut the grass
hay is normally brought in twice a year often also on festival days
in the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters
the kitchen is separated from the living area and second floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat
the typical swiss chalet originated in the bernese oberland
chalets often face south or downhill and are built of solid wood with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily
stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside and balconies are sometimes enclosed
food is passed from the kitchen to the stube where the dining room table is placed
some meals are communal such as fondue where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into
other meals are still served traditionally on carved wooden plates
furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation
roofs are traditionally constructed from alpine rocks such as pieces of schist gneiss or slate
such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys as in the maurienne valley in savoy where the amount of snow during the cold months is important
the inclination of the roof cannot exceed allowing the snow to stay on top thereby functioning as insulation from the cold
in the lower areas where the forests are widespread wooden tiles are traditionally used
commonly made of norway spruce they are called tavaillon
in the german speaking parts of the alps there is a strong tradition of alpine folk culture
old traditions are carefully maintained among inhabitants of alpine areas even though this is seldom obvious to the visitor many people are members of cultural associations where the alpine folk culture is cultivated
at cultural events traditional folk costume is expected typically lederhosen for men and dirndls for women
visitors can get a glimpse of the rich customs of the alps at public volksfeste
even when large events feature only a little folk culture all participants take part with gusto
good opportunities to see local people celebrating the traditional culture occur at the many fairs wine festivals and firefighting festivals which fill weekends in the countryside from spring to autumn
alpine festivals vary from country to country
frequently they include music dance sports as well as traditions with pagan roots such as the lighting of fires on walpurgis night and saint johns eve
many areas celebrate fastnacht in the weeks before lent
folk costume also continues to be worn for most weddings and festivals
the alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such as oberstdorf in bavaria saalbach in austria davos in switzerland chamonix in france and cortina dampezzo in italy recording more than a million annual visitors
with over million visitors a year tourism is integral to the alpine economy with much of it coming from winter sports although summer visitors are also an important component
the tourism industry began in the early th century when foreigners visited the alps travelled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery and stayed at the spa resorts
large hotels were built during the belle poque cog railways built early in the th century brought tourists to ever higher elevations with the jungfraubahn terminating at the jungfraujoch well above the eternal snow line after going through a tunnel in eiger
during this period winter sports were slowly introduced in the first figure skating championship was held in st
moritz and downhill skiing became a popular sport with english visitors early in the th century as the first ski lift was installed in above grindelwald
in the first half of the th century the olympic winter games were held three times in alpine venues the winter olympics in chamonix france the winter olympics in st
moritz switzerland and the winter olympics in garmisch partenkirchen germany
during world war ii the winter games were cancelled but after that time the winter games have been held in st
moritz cortina dampezzo innsbruck austria grenoble france albertville france and turin
in the lauberhorn rennen was run for the first time on the lauberhorn above wengen the equally demanding hahnenkamm was first run in the same year in kitzbhl austria
both races continue to be held each january on successive weekends
the lauberhorn is the more strenuous downhill race at and poses danger to racers who reach within seconds of leaving the start gate
during the post world war i period ski lifts were built in swiss and austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors and summer tourism continued to be important
by the mid th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the s several new villages were built in france devoted almost exclusively to skiing such as les menuires
until this point austria and switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports and by the end of the th century and into the early st century france italy and tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors
from to the present ski lifts have been modernized and snow making machines installed at many resorts leading to mounting concerns regarding the loss of traditional alpine culture and uncertainties regarding sustainable development
for instance the number of ski resorts and piste kilometres has declined since a likely result of climatic change
the region is serviced by of roads used by six million vehicles per year
train travel is well established in the alps with for instance of track for every in a country such as switzerland
most of europes highest railways are located there
in the new ltschberg base tunnel was opened which circumvents the years older ltschberg tunnel
with the opening of the gotthard base tunnel on june it bypasses the gotthard tunnel built in the th century and realizes the first flat route through the alps
some high mountain villages are car free either because of inaccessibility or by choice
wengen and zermatt are accessible only by cable car or cog rail trains
avoriaz is car free with other alpine villages considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile alpine terrain
the lower regions and larger towns of the alps are well served by motorways and main roads but higher mountain passes and byroads which are amongst the highest in europe can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes
many passes are closed in winter
several airports around the alps as well as long distance rail links from all neighbouring countries afford large numbers of travellers easy access
albert camus was a french philosopher author dramatist journalist world federalist and political activist
he was the recipient of the nobel prize in literature at the age of the second youngest recipient in history
his works include the stranger the plague the myth of sisyphus the fall and the rebel
camus was born in algeria during the french colonization to pied noir parents
he spent his childhood in a poor neighbourhood and later studied philosophy at the university of algiers
he was in paris when the germans invaded france during world war ii in
camus tried to flee but finally joined the french resistance where he served as editor in chief at combat an outlawed newspaper
after the war he was a celebrity figure and gave many lectures around the world
he married twice but had many extramarital affairs
camus was politically active he was part of the left that opposed joseph stalin and the soviet union because of their totalitarianism
camus was a moralist and leaned towards anarcho syndicalism
he was part of many organisations seeking european integration
during the algerian war he kept a neutral stance advocating a multicultural and pluralistic algeria a position that was rejected by most parties
philosophically camus views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism
some consider camus work to show him to be an existentialist even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime
albert camus was born on november in a working class neighbourhood in mondovi in french algeria
his mother catherine hlne camus was french with balearic spanish ancestry
she was deaf and illiterate
he never knew his father lucien camus a poor french agricultural worker killed in action while serving with a zouave regiment in october during world war i
camus his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the belcourt section of algiers
camus was a second generation french inhabitant of algeria which was a french territory from until
his paternal grandfather along with many others of his generation had moved to algeria for a better life during the first decades of the th century
hence he was called a a slang term for people of french and other european descent born in algeria
his identity and poor background had a substantial effect on his later life
nevertheless camus was a french citizen and enjoyed more rights than arab and berber algerians under
during his childhood he developed a love for football and swimming
under the influence of his teacher louis germain camus gained a scholarship in to continue his studies at a prestigious lyceum near algiers
germain immediately noticed his lively intelligence and his desire to learn
in middle school he gave camus free lessons to prepare him for the scholarship competition despite the fact that his grandmother had a destiny in store for him as a manual worker so that he could immediately contribute to the maintenance of the family
camus maintained great gratitude and affection towards louis germain throughout his life and to whom he dedicated his speech for accepting the nobel prize
having received the news of the awarding of the prize he wrote but when i heard the news my first thought after my mother was of you
without you without the affectionate hand you extended to the small poor child that i was without your teaching and example none of all this would have happened
in a letter dated april germain lovingly reciprocated the warm feelings towards his former pupil calling him my little camus
in at the age of he was diagnosed with tuberculosis
because it is a transmitted disease he moved out of his home and stayed with his uncle gustave acault a butcher who influenced the young camus
it was at that time he turned to philosophy with the mentoring of his philosophy teacher jean grenier
he was impressed by ancient greek philosophers and friedrich nietzsche
during that time he was only able to study part time
to earn money he took odd jobs including as a private tutor car parts clerk and assistant at the meteorological institute
in camus enrolled at the university of algiers and completed his licence de philosophie in after presenting his thesis on plotinus
camus developed an interest in early christian philosophers but nietzsche and arthur schopenhauer had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism
camus also studied novelist philosophers such as stendhal herman melville fyodor dostoyevsky and franz kafka
in he also met simone hi then a partner of camuss friend who later became his first wife
camus played as goalkeeper for the racing universitaire dalger junior team from to
the sense of team spirit fraternity and common purpose appealed to him enormously
in match reports he was often praised for playing with passion and courage
any football ambitions however disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis
camus drew parallels among football human existence morality and personal identity
for him the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and church
in camus was in a relationship with simone hi
simone had an addiction to morphine a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains
his uncle gustave did not approve of the relationship but camus married hi to help her fight the addiction
he subsequently discovered she was in a relationship with her doctor at the same time and the couple later divorced
camus joined the french communist party in early
he saw it as a way to fight inequalities between europeans and natives in algeria even though he was not a marxist
he explained we might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities
camus left the pcf a year later
in the independence minded algerian communist party was founded and camus joined it after his mentor grenier advised him to do so
camuss main role within the pca was to organise the
camus was also close to the which was a moderate anti colonialist nationalist party
as tensions in the interwar period escalated the stalinist pca and ppa broke ties
camus was expelled from the pca for refusing to toe the party line
this series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity
camuss mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew
he continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group
some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels
in camus began working for the leftist newspaper as he had strong anti fascist feelings and the rise of fascist regimes in europe was worrying him
by then camus had developed strong feelings against authoritarian colonialism as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the arabs and berbers by french authorities
was banned in and camus flew to paris to take a new job at as layout editor
in paris he almost completed his first cycle of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless the novel ltranger the philosophical essay le mythe de sisyphe and the play caligula
each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a theatrical play
soon after camus moved to paris the outbreak of world war ii began to affect france
camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had once had tuberculosis
as the germans were marching towards paris camus fled
he was laid off from and ended up in lyon where he married pianist and mathematician francine faure on december
camus and faure moved back to algeria where he taught in primary schools
because of his tuberculosis he moved to the french alps on medical advice
there he began writing his second cycle of works this time dealing with revolt a novel la peste and a play le malentendu
by he was known because of his earlier work
he returned to paris where he met and became friends with jean paul sartre
he also became part of a circle of intellectuals which included simone de beauvoir and andr breton
among them was the actress mara casares who later had an affair with camus
camus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the germans during the french occupation
upon his arrival in paris he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper combat
camus used a pseudonym for his combat articles and used false id cards to avoid being captured
he continued writing for the paper after the liberation of france composing almost daily editorials under his real name
during that period he composed four lettres un ami allemand explaining why resistance was necessary
after the war camus lived in paris with faure who gave birth to twins catherine and jean in
camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the resistance
he gave lectures at various universities in the united states and latin america during two separate trips
he also visited algeria once more only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies which he had warned about many times
during this period he completed the second cycle of his work with the essay
camus attacked totalitarian communism while advocating libertarian socialism and anarcho syndicalism
upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in france with his rejection of communism the book brought about the final split with sartre
his relations with the marxist left deteriorated further during the algerian war
camus was a strong supporter of european integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end
in he founded the declaring that europe can only evolve along the path of economic progress democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation
in he founded the a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism
his main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of andr breton
camus also raised his voice against the soviet invasion of hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of francos regime in spain
camus had numerous affairs particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the spanish born actress mara casares with whom he had extensive correspondence
faure did not take this affair lightly
she had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early s
camus who felt guilty withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time
in camus received the news that he was to be awarded the nobel prize in literature
this came as a shock to him he anticipated andr malraux would win the award
at age he was the second youngest recipient of the prize after rudyard kipling who was
after this he began working on his autobiography in an attempt to examine moral learning
he also turned to the theatre once more
financed by the money he received with his nobel prize he adapted and directed for the stage dostoyevskys novel demons
the play opened in january at the antoine theatre in paris and was a critical success
during these years he published posthumously the works of the philosopher simone weil in the series espoir which he had founded for ditions gallimard
weil had great influence on his philosophy since he saw her writings as an antidote to nihilism
camus described her as the only great spirit of our times
camus died on january at the age of in a car accident near sens in le grand fossard in the small town of villeblevin
he had spent the new years holiday of at his house in lourmarin vaucluse with his family and his publisher michel gallimard of ditions gallimard along with gallimards wife janine and daughter
camuss wife and children went back to paris by train on january but camus decided to return in gallimards luxurious facel vega fv
the car crashed into a plane tree on a long straight stretch of the route nationale
camus who was in the passenger seat died instantly
gallimard died five days later although his wife and daughter were unharmed
pages of a handwritten manuscript entitled le premier homme were found in the wreckage
camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in algeria would be his finest work
camus was buried in the lourmarin cemetery vaucluse france where he had lived
jean paul sartre read a eulogy paying tribute to camuss heroic stubborn humanism
william faulkner wrote his obituary saying when the door shut for him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death is hoping to do i was here
camuss first publication was a play called written with three friends in may
the subject was the revolt by spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the spanish government resulting in to deaths
in may he wrote his first book
both were published by edmond charlots small publishing house
camus separated his work into three cycles
each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a play
the first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ltranger le mythe de sysiphe and caligula
the second was the cycle of the revolt which included la peste lhomme rvolt and les justes
the third the cycle of the love consisted of nemesis
each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs
the books in the first cycle were published between and but the theme was conceived earlier at least as far back as
with this cycle camus aimed to pose a question on the human condition discuss the world as an absurd place and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism
camus began his work on the second cycle while he was in algeria in the last months of just as the germans were reaching north africa
in the second cycle camus used prometheus who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion
he analyses various aspects of rebellion its metaphysics its connection to politics and examines it under the lens of modernity historicity and the absence of a god
after receiving the nobel prize camus gathered clarified and published his pacifist leaning views at
he then decided to distance himself from the algerian war as he found the mental burden too heavy
he turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess nemesis the greek and roman goddess of revenge
two of camuss works were published posthumously
the first entitled la mort heureuse is a novel that was written between and
it features a character named patrice mersault comparable to the strangers meursault
there is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books
the second was an unfinished novel le premier homme which camus was writing before he died
it was an autobiographical work about his childhood in algeria and its publication in sparked a widespread reconsideration of camuss allegedly unrepentant colonialism
camus was a moralist he claimed morality should guide politics
while he did not deny that morals change over time he rejected the classical marxist view that historical material relations define morality
camus was also strongly critical of marxism leninism especially in the case of the soviet union which he considered totalitarian
camus rebuked those sympathetic to the soviet model and their decision to call total servitude freedom
a proponent of libertarian socialism he stated that the soviet union was not socialist and the united states was not liberal
his critique of the soviet union caused him to clash with others on the political left most notably with his on again off again friend jean paul sartre
active in the french resistance to the nazi occupation of france during world war ii camus wrote for and edited the resistance journal combat
of the french collaboration with the german occupiers he wrote now the only moral value is courage which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people
after frances liberation camus remarked this country does not need a talleyrand but a saint just
the reality of the postwar tribunals soon changed his mind camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment
camus had anarchist sympathies which intensified in the s when he came to believe that the soviet model was morally bankrupt
camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation authority property the state and centralization
however he opposed revolution separating the rebel from the revolutionary and believing that the belief in absolute truth most often assuming the guise of history or reason inspires the revolutionary and leads to tragic results
he believed that rebellion is spurred by our outrage over the worlds lack of transcendent significance while political rebellion is our response to attacks against the dignity and autonomy of the individual
camus opposed political violence tolerating it only in rare and very narrowly defined instances as well as revolutionary terror which he accused of sacrificing innocent lives on the altar of history
philosophy professor david sherman considers camus an anarcho syndicalist
graeme nicholson considers camus an existentialist anarchist
the anarchist andr prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting of the in as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought
camus wrote for anarchist publications such as and the organ of the anarcho syndicalist confederacin nacional del trabajo
camus kept a neutral stance during the algerian revolution
while he was against the violence of the national liberation front he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist france
he was supportive of pierre mends frances unified socialist party and its approach to the crisis mends france advocated for reconciliation
camus also supported a like minded algerian militant aziz kessous
camus traveled to algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties
in one often misquoted incident camus confronted an algerian critic during his nobel prize acceptance speech in stockholm rejecting the false equivalence of justice with revolutionary terrorism people are now planting bombs in the tramways of algiers
my mother might be on one of those tramways
if that is justice then i prefer my mother
critics have labelled the response as reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude
camus was sharply critical of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki
in the s camus devoted his efforts to human rights
in he resigned from his work for unesco when the un accepted spain under the leadership of the caudillo general francisco franco as a member
camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world
he wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with arthur koestler the writer intellectual and founder of the league against capital punishment entitled published by calmann levy in
along with albert einstein camus was one of the sponsors of the peoples world convention also known as peoples world constituent assembly which took place between and at palais electoral in geneva switzerland
born in algeria to french parents camus was familiar with the institutional racism of france against arabs and berbers but he was not part of a rich elite
he lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of france and as such was entitled to citizens rights members of the countrys arab and berber majority were not
camus was a vocal advocate of the new mediterranean culture
this was his vision of embracing the multi ethnicity of the algerian people in opposition to latiny a popular pro fascist and antisemitic ideology among other pieds noirs french or europeans born in algeria
for camus this vision encapsulated the hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the mediterranean sea
his address on the new mediterranean culture represents camuss most systematic statement of his views at this time
camus also supported the blum viollette proposal to grant algerians full french citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds
in camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the kabylie highlands
he advocated for economic educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency
in following the stif and guelma massacre after arabs revolted against french mistreatment camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony
he wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions and advocating for french reforms and concessions to the demands of the algerian people
when the algerian war began in camus was confronted with a moral dilemma
he identified with the pieds noirs such as his own parents and defended the french governments actions against the revolt
he argued the algerian uprising was an integral part of the new arab imperialism led by egypt and an anti western offensive orchestrated by russia to encircle europe and isolate the united states
although favoring greater algerian autonomy or even federation though not full scale independence he believed the pieds noirs and arabs could co exist
during the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians
it was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish
behind the scenes he began working for imprisoned algerians who faced the death penalty
his position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics such as edward said who were opposed to european imperialism and charged that camuss novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions or conscious erasures of algerias arab population
in their eyes camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed
camus once said that the troubles in algeria affected him as others feel pain in their lungs
even though camus is mostly connected to absurdism he is routinely categorized as an existentialist a term he rejected on several occasions
camus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient greek philosophy nietzsche and th century moralists whereas existentialism arose from th and early th century philosophy such as sren kierkegaard karl jaspers and martin heidegger
he also said his work the myth of sisyphus was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism
camus rejected existentialism as a philosophy but his critique was mostly focused on sartrean existentialism and though to a lesser extent on religious existentialism
he thought that the importance of history held by marx and sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom
david sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between sartre and camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism
david simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that existence precedes essence
on the other hand camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions
the absurdity of life and that it inevitably ends in death is highlighted in his acts
his belief was that the absurd life being void of meaning or mans inability to know that meaning if it were to exist was something that man should embrace
his opposition to christianity and his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers
camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism the problem of suicide
he wrote there is only one really serious philosophical question and that is suicide
camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life
many existentialist writers have addressed the absurd each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important
kierkegaard suggests that the absurdity of religious truths prevents people from reaching god rationally
sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience
camuss thoughts on the absurd begin with his first cycle of books and the literary essay the myth of sisyphus his major work on the subject
in he published the story of a man living an absurd life in the stranger
he also wrote a play about the roman emperor caligula pursuing an absurd logic which was not performed until
his early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays betwixt and between in
absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays in
in these essays camus reflects on the experience of the absurd
aspects of the notion of the absurd can also be found in the plague
camus follows sartres definition of the absurd that which is meaningless
thus mans existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification
the absurd is created because man who is placed in an unintelligent universe realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component as camus himself explains the absurd is the result of the confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world
even though absurdity is inescapable camus does not drift towards nihilism
but the realization of absurdity leads to the question why should someone continue to live suicide is an option that camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom
rather he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it
the turning point in camuss attitude to the absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous german friend written between july and july
the first was published in the in the second in the in and the third in the newspaper in
the four letters were published as in and were included in the collection resistance rebellion and death
camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a philosopher of the absurd
he showed less interest in the absurd shortly after publishing the myth of sisyphus
to distinguish his ideas scholars sometimes refer to the paradox of the absurd when referring to camuss absurd
camus articulated the case for revolting against any kind of oppression injustice or whatever disrespects the human condition
he is cautious enough however to set the limits on the rebellion
the rebel explains in detail his thoughts on the issue
there he builds upon the absurd described in the myth of sisyphus but goes further
in the introduction where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion he concludes with the phrase i revolt therefore we exist implying the recognition of a common human condition
camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebels revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime he therefore places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution
camus poses a crucial question is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner in a silent universe according to him the answer is yes as the experience and awareness of the absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions
camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes
first there is the metaphysical rebellion which is the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation
the other mode historical rebellion is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world
in this attempt the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries and not cause any unjustifiable suffering
camuss novels and philosophical essays are still influential
after his death interest in camus followed the rise and diminution of the new left
following the collapse of the soviet union interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced
he is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance dialogue and civil rights
although camus has been linked to anti soviet communism reaching as far as anarcho syndicalism some neoliberals have tried to associate him with their policies for instance the french president nicolas sarkozy suggested that his remains be moved to the panthon an idea that was criticised by camuss surviving family and angered many on the left
american heavy metal band avenged sevenfold stated that their album life is but a dream
was inspired by the work of camus
albert camus also served as the inspiration for the aquarius gold saint camus in the classic anime and manga saint seiya
in tipasa algeria inside the roman ruins facing the sea and mount chenoua a stele was erected in in honor of albert camus with this phrase in french extracted from his work i understand here what is called glory the right to love beyond measure
the french post published a stamp with his likeness on june

agatha christie limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than of christies novels and short stories plays and nearly tv films
in the late s christie had reputedly been earning around per year
christie sold an estimated million books during her lifetime
at the time of her death in she was the best selling novelist in history
one estimate of her total earnings from more than a half century of writing is million

christies family and family trusts including great grandson james prichard continue to own the stake in agatha christie limited and remain associated with the company

since reissues of christies miss marple and hercule poirot novels by harpercollins have removed passages containing descriptions insults or references to ethnicity
christies first published book the mysterious affair at styles was released in and introduced the detective hercule poirot who appeared in of her novels and more than short stories
over the years christie grew tired of poirot much as doyle did with sherlock holmes
by the end of the s christie wrote in her diary that she was finding poirot insufferable and by the s she felt he was an egocentric creep
thompson believes christies occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated and points out that in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood
unlike doyle she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular
she married off poirots watson captain arthur hastings in an attempt to trim her cast commitments
miss jane marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in december and were subsequently collected under the title the thirteen problems
marple was a genteel elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to english village life
christie said miss marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and christies step grandmother margaret miller and her ealing cronies
both marple and miller always expected the worst of everyone and everything and were with almost frightening accuracy usually proved right
marple appeared in novels and stories
during the second world war christie wrote two novels curtain and sleeping murder featuring hercule poirot and miss marple respectively
both books were sealed in a bank vault and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy
christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in after which she was unable to write
her daughter authorised the publication of curtain in and sleeping murder was published posthumously in
these publications followed the success of the film version of murder on the orient express
shortly before the publication of curtain poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in the new york times which was printed on page one on august
christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both poirot and miss marple
in a recording discovered and released in christie revealed the reason for this hercule poirot a complete egoist would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady
hercule poirota professional sleuthwould not be at home at all in miss marples world
in the christie family supported the release of a new poirot story the monogram murders written by british author sophie hannah
hannah later published three more poirot mysteries closed casket in the mystery of three quarters in
and the killings at kingfisher hill in
christie has been called the duchess of death the mistress of mystery and the queen of crime
early in her career a reporter noted that her plots are possible logical and always new
according to hannah at the start of each novel she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering how can this be happening
then slowly she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened
christie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the golden age of detective fiction
author dilys winn called christie the doyenne of coziness a sub genre which featured a small village setting a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from paraguay
at the end in a christie hallmark the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room explains the course of their deductive reasoning and reveals the guilty party but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all
christie did not limit herself to quaint english villagesthe action might take place on a small island an aeroplane a train a steamship a smart london flat a resort in the west indies or an archaeological dig but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate family members friends servants business associates fellow travellers
stereotyped characters abound but these may be subverted to stymie the reader impersonations and secret alliances are always possible
there is always a motivemost often money there are very few killers in christie who enjoy murder for its own sake
professor of pharmacology michael c
gerald noted that in over half her novels one or more victims are poisoned albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator
guns knives garrottes tripwires blunt instruments and even a hatchet were also used but christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity according to john curran author and literary adviser to the christie estate
many of her clues are mundane objects a calendar a coffee cup wax flowers a beer bottle a fireplace used during a heat wave
according to crime writer p
james christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party
alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect
christie mocked this insight in her foreword to cards on the table spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished
since i do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust i prefer to warn them beforehand that this is not that kind of book
on bbc radio s desert island discs in brian aldiss said christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter then decided who the most unlikely suspect was after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to frame that person
based upon a study of her working notebooks curran describes how christie would first create a cast of characters choose a setting and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot
of necessity the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel
much of the work particularly dialogue was done in her head before she put it on paper
in the members of the crime writers association chose the murder of roger ackroyd as the best whodunit
ever written
author julian symons observed in an obvious sense the book fits within the conventions
the setting is a village deep within the english countryside roger ackroyd dies in his study there is a butler who behaves suspiciously
every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor who tells the story and acts as poirots watson
critic sutherland scott stated if agatha christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks for writing this novel
in september to mark her th birthday and then there were none was named the worlds favourite christie in a vote sponsored by the authors estate
the novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it
and then there were none carries the closed society type of murder mystery to extreme lengths according to author charles osborne
it begins with the classic set up of potential victim and killer isolated from the outside world but then violates conventions
there is no detective involved in the action no interviews of suspects no careful search for clues and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution
as christie herself said ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious
critics agreed she had succeeded the arrogant mrs christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity
the reviews not surprisingly were without exception wildly adulatory
christie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work especially before particularly in regard to italians jews and non europeans
for example she described men of hebraic extraction sallow men with hooked noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery in the short story the soul of the croupier from the collection the mysterious mr quin
in the anti defamation league in the us sent an official letter of complaint to christies american publishers dodd mead and company regarding perceived antisemitism in her works
christies british literary agent later wrote to her us representative authorising american publishers to omit the word jew when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books
in the hollow published in one of the characters is described by another as a whitechapel jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake
a small woman with a thick nose henna red hair and a disagreeable voice
to contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions christie portrayed some foreign characters as victims or potential victims at the hands of english malefactors such as respectively olga seminoff and katrina reiger
jewish characters are often seen as un english but they are rarely the culprits
in the telegraph reported that several agatha christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language including insults and references to ethnicity
poirot and miss marple mysteries written between and have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by harpercollins in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive especially those involving the characters christies protagonists encounter outside the uk
sensitivity readers had made the edits which were evident in digital versions of the new editions including the entire miss marple run and selected poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since
in addition to hercule poirot and miss marple christie also created amateur detectives thomas beresford and his wife prudence tuppence ne cowley who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between and
unlike her other sleuths the beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in the secret adversary and were allowed to age alongside their creator
she treated their stories with a lighter touch giving them a dash and verve which was not universally admired by critics
their last adventure postern of fate was christies last novel
harley quin was easily the most unorthodox of christies fictional detectives
inspired by christies affection for the figures from the harlequinade the semi supernatural quin always works with an elderly conventional man called satterthwaite
the pair appear in short stories of which were collected in as the mysterious mr quin
mallowan described these tales as detection in a fanciful vein touching on the fairy story a natural product of agathas peculiar imagination
satterthwaite also appears in a novel three act tragedy and a short story dead mans mirror both of which feature poirot
another of her lesser known characters is parker pyne a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner
the short stories which introduced him parker pyne investigates are best remembered for the case of the discontented soldier which features ariadne oliver an amusing and satirical self portrait of agatha christie
over the ensuing decades oliver reappeared in seven novels
in most of them she assists poirot
in michael morton adapted the murder of roger ackroyd for the stage under the name of alibi
the play enjoyed a respectable run but christie disliked the changes made to her work and in future preferred to write for the theatre herself
the first of her own stage works was black coffee which received good reviews when it opened in the west end in late
she followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels and then there were none in appointment with death in and the hollow in
in the s the theatre
engaged much of agathas attention
she next adapted her short radio play into the mousetrap which premiered in the west end in produced by peter saunders and starring richard attenborough as the original detective sergeant trotter
her expectations for the play were not high she believed it would run no more than eight months
the mousetrap has long since made theatrical history as the worlds longest running play staging its th performance in september
the play temporarily closed in march when all uk theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic before it re opened on may
in she followed this with witness for the prosecution whose broadway production won the new york drama critics circle award for best foreign play of and earned christie an edgar award from the mystery writers of america
spiders web an original work written for actress margaret lockwood at her request premiered in the west end in and was also a hit
christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in london the mousetrap witness for the prosecution and spiders web
she said plays are much easier to write than books because you can see them in your minds eye you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with whats happening
in a letter to her daughter christie said being a playwright was a lot of fun christie published six mainstream novels under the name mary westmacott a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore her most private and precious imaginative garden
these books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction
of the first giants bread published in a reviewer for the new york times wrote
her book is far above the average of current fiction in fact comes well under the classification of a good book
and it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation
it was publicized from the very beginning that mary westmacott was a pen name of a well known author although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret the dust jacket of giants bread mentions that the author had previously written under her real name
half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales
after christies authorship of the first four westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in she wrote two more the last in
the other westmacott titles are unfinished portrait absent in the spring the rose and the yew tree a daughters a daughter and the burden
christie published a few non fiction works
come tell me how you live about working on an archaeological dig was drawn from her life with mallowan
the grand tour around the world with the queen of mystery is a collection of correspondence from her grand tour of the british empire including south africa australia new zealand and canada
was published posthumously in and adjudged the best critical biographical work at the edgar awards
many of christies works from onward have titles drawn from literature with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph
christie biographer gillian gill said christies writing has the sparseness the directness the narrative pace and the universal appeal of the fairy story and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown up children that christies novels succeed
reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror numerous christie titles were drawn from well known childrens nursery rhymes and then there were none one two buckle my shoe five little pigs crooked house a pocket full of rye hickory dickory dock and three blind mice
christie is regularly referred to as the queen of crime which is now trademarked by the christie estate or queen of mystery and is considered a master of suspense plotting and characterisation
in she became the first recipient of the mystery writers of americas grand master award
she was named best writer of the century and the hercule poirot series of books was named best series of the century at the bouchercon world mystery convention
in she was voted best crime writer in a survey of members of the crime writers association of professional novelists
however the writer raymond chandler criticised the artificiality of her books as did writer julian symons
the literary critic edmund wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial
in christie was named by the digital crime drama tv channel alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the united kingdom after james bond author ian fleming with total earnings around million
in christie was among the people selected by the artist peter blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work the beatles sgt
peppers lonely hearts club band album cover to celebrate the british cultural figures he most admires
on the record breaking longevity of christies the mousetrap which had marked its th anniversary in stephen moss in the guardian wrote the play and its author are the stars
in marking the th anniversary of her birth date contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on christies works
many of the authors had read christies novels first before other mystery writers in english or in their native language influencing their own writing and nearly all still viewed her as the queen of crime and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors
nearly all had one or more favourites among christies mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly years after her first novel was published
just one of the authors held with wilsons views
in her prime christie was rarely out of the bestseller list
she was the first crime writer to have copies of of her titles published by penguin on the same day in

the first was the british film the passing of mr quin
poirots first film appearance was in in alibi which starred austin trevor as christies sleuth
margaret rutherford played marple in a series of films released in the s

she felt differently about the film murder on the orient express directed by sidney lumet which featured major stars and high production values her attendance at the london premiere was one of her last public outings
in a new film version was released directed by kenneth branagh who also starred wearing the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen

during the first world war christie took a break from nursing to train for the apothecaries hall examination
while she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous and thus less enjoyable than nursing her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs
early in the second world war she brought her skills up to date at torquay hospital
as michael c
gerald puts it her activities as a hospital dispenser during both world wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons
these hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians nurses and pharmacists play in her stories
there were to be many medical practitioners pharmacists and scientists nave or suspicious in christies cast of characters featuring in murder in mesopotamia cards on the table the pale horse and mrs mcgintys dead among many others
gillian gill notes that the murder method in christies first detective novel the mysterious affair at styles comes right out of agatha christies work in the hospital dispensary
in an interview with journalist marcelle bernstein christie stated i dont like messy deaths
im more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why
with her expert knowledge christie had no need of poisons unknown to science which were forbidden under ronald knoxs ten rules for detective fiction
arsenic aconite strychnine digitalis nicotine thallium and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades
in her youth christie showed little interest in antiquities
after her marriage to mallowan in she accompanied him on annual expeditions spending three to four months at a time in syria and iraq at excavation sites at ur nineveh tell arpachiyah chagar bazar tell brak and nimrud
the mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites visiting italy greece egypt iran and the soviet union among other places
their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as murder on the orient express death on the nile and appointment with death
for the digging season at nineveh christie bought a writing table to continue her own work in the early s she paid to add a small writing room to the teams house at nimrud
she also devoted time and effort each season in making herself useful by photographing cleaning and recording finds and restoring ceramics which she especially enjoyed
she also provided funds for the expeditions
many of the settings for christies books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the middle east this is reflected in the detail with which she describes themfor instance the temple of abu simbel as depicted in death on the nilewhile the settings for they came to baghdad were places she and mallowan had recently stayed
similarly she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout murder in mesopotamia
archaeologists and experts in middle eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include dr eric leidner in murder in mesopotamia and signor richetti in death on the nile
after the second world war christie chronicled her time in syria in come tell me how you live which she described as small beera very little book full of everyday doings and happenings
from november to march the british museum presented a colourful and episodic exhibition called agatha christie and archaeology mystery in mesopotamia which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined

the plague is a absurdist novel by albert camus
it tells the story from the point of view of a narrator in the midst of a plague sweeping the french algerian city of oran
the narrator remains unknown until the beginning of the last chapter
the novel presents a snapshot into life in oran as seen through the authors distinctive absurdist point of view
camus used as source material the cholera epidemic that killed a large proportion of orans population in but set the novel in the s
oran and its surroundings were struck by disease several times before camus published his novel
according to an academic study oran was decimated by the bubonic plague in and but all later outbreaks were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel
the plague is considered an existentialist classic despite camus objection to the label
the novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their own destinies
the narrative tone is similar to kafkas especially in the trial whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition
in the town of oran thousands of rats initially unnoticed by the populace begin to die in the streets
hysteria develops soon afterward causing the local newspapers to report the incident
authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague
the main character dr bernard rieux lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the buildings concierge m
michel a confidante dies from a fever
dr rieux consults his colleague dr castel about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town
they both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death
however as more deaths quickly ensue it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic
meanwhile rieuxs wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness
authorities including the prefect are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take
official notices enacting control measures are posted but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation
a special ward is opened at the hospital but its beds are filled within three days
as the death toll begins to rise more desperate measures are taken
homes are quarantined corpses and burials are strictly supervised
a supply of plague serum finally arrives but there is enough to treat only existing cases and the countrys emergency reserves are depleted
when the daily number of deaths jumps to the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared
the town is sealed off
the town gates are shut rail travel is prohibited and all mail service is suspended
the use of telephone lines is restricted only to urgent calls leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town
the separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople who begin to feel isolated and introverted and the plague begins to affect various characters
one character raymond rambert devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in paris after city officials refused his request to leave
he befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city
another character father paneloux uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of god punishing the citizens sinful nature
his diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances
cottard a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested becomes wealthy as a major smuggler
meanwhile jean tarrou a vacationer joseph grand a civil engineer and dr rieux exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital
rambert informs tarrou of his escape plan but when tarrou tells him that there are others in the city including dr rieux who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see rambert becomes sympathetic and offers to help rieux fight the epidemic until he leaves town
in mid august the situation continues to worsen
people try to escape the town but some are shot by armed sentries
violence and looting break out on a small scale and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew
funerals are conducted with more speed no ceremony and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased
the inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation
despondent they waste away emotionally as well as physically
in september and october the town remains at the mercy of the plague
rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wifes condition is worsening
he also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work
cottard on the other hand seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others since everybody faces the same danger
cottard and tarrou attend a performance of glucks opera orfeo ed euridice but the actor portraying orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance
after extended negotiations with guards rambert finally has a chance to escape but he decides to stay saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left
towards the end of october castels new antiplague serum is tried for the first time but it cannot save the life of othons young son who suffers greatly as paneloux rieux and tarrou tend to his bedside in horror
paneloux who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague gives a second sermon
he addresses the problem of an innocent childs suffering and says it is a test of a christians faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything
he urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague
a few days after the sermon paneloux is taken ill
his symptoms do not conform to those of the plague but the disease still proves fatal
tarrou and rambert visit one of the isolation camps where they meet othon
when othons period of quarantine ends he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son
tarrou tells rieux the story of his life
to take their mind off the epidemic the two men go swimming together in the sea
grand catches the plague and instructs rieux to burn all his papers
however grand makes an unexpected recovery and deaths from the plague start to decline
by late january the plague is in full retreat and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates
othon however does not escape death from the disease
cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic from which he has profited by shady dealings
two government employees approach him and he flees
despite the epidemics ending tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle
rieux is later informed via telegram that his wife has died at the sanatorium
in february the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities
rambert is reunited with his wife
cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home and is soon arrested after a brief skirmish with the police
grand begins working on his novel again
the narrator of the chronicle discloses his identity and states that he tried to present an objective view of the events
he reflects on the epidemic and declares he wrote the chronicle to write simply about what can be learned in the middle of scourges that there is more to admire in humans than there is to scorn
germaine bre has characterised the struggle of the characters against the plague as undramatic and stubborn and in contrast to the ideology of glorification of power in the novels of andr malraux whereas camus characters are obscurely engaged in saving not destroying and this in the name of no ideology
lulu haroutunian has discussed camus own medical history including a bout with tuberculosis and how it informs the novel
marina warner notes its larger philosophical themes of engagement paltriness and generosity small heroism and large cowardice and all kinds of profoundly humanist problems such as love and goodness happiness and mutual connection
thomas l hanna and john loose have separately discussed themes related to christianity in the novel with particular respect to father paneloux and dr rieux
louis r rossi briefly discusses the role of tarrou in the novel and the sense of philosophical guilt behind his character
elwyn sterling has analysed the role of cottard and his final actions at the end of the novel
father paneloux has been subject to several literary analyses in the context of faith faced with great suffering
dr rieux has been described as a classic example of an idealist doctor
he has also been an inspiration to the life and career of the french doctor rjean thomas and also to the fictional character of jeanne dion starring in the movie trilogy directed by bernard mond
perri klass has noted that at the time of the novel sulfa drugs were available for treatment against plague and has criticised the novel for this historical medical omission
the novel has been read as an allegorical treatment of the french resistance to nazi occupation during world war ii
the novel became a bestseller during the worldwide covid pandemic of to the point that its british publisher penguin classics reported struggling to keep up with demand
the prescience of the fictional cordon sanitaire of oran with real life covid lockdowns worldwide brought revived popular attention
sales in italy tripled and it became a top ten bestseller during its nationwide lockdown
penguin classics editorial director said it couldnt be more relevant to the current moment and camus daughter catherine said that the message of the novel had newfound relevance in that we are not responsible for coronavirus but we can be responsible in the way we respond to it
as early as april camus had been working on the novel as evidenced in his diaries in which he wrote down a few ideas on the redeeming plague
on march he informed andr malraux that he was writing a novel on the plague adding said like that it might sound strange but this subject seems so natural to me
applied ethics is the practical aspect of moral considerations
it is ethics with respect to real world actions and their moral considerations in private and public life the professions health technology law and leadership
for example bioethics is concerned with identifying the best approach to moral issues in the life sciences such as euthanasia the allocation of scarce health resources or the use of human embryos in research
environmental ethics is concerned with ecological issues such as the responsibility of government and corporations to clean up pollution
business ethics includes the duties of whistleblowers to the public and to their employers
applied ethics has expanded the study of ethics beyond the realms of academic philosophical discourse
the field of applied ethics as it appears today emerged from debate surrounding rapid medical and technological advances in the early s and is now established as a subdiscipline of moral philosophy
however applied ethics is by its very nature a multi professional subject because it requires specialist understanding of the potential ethical issues in fields like medicine business or information technology
nowadays ethical codes of conduct exist in almost every profession
an applied ethics approach to the examination of moral dilemmas can take many different forms but one of the most influential and most widely utilised approaches in bioethics and health care ethics is the four principle approach developed by tom beauchamp and james childress
the four principle approach commonly termed principlism entails consideration and application of four prima facie ethical principles autonomy non maleficence beneficence and justice
applied ethics is distinguished from normative ethics which concerns standards for right and wrong behavior and from meta ethics which concerns the nature of ethical properties statements attitudes and judgments
whilst these three areas of ethics appear to be distinct they are also interrelated
the use of an applied ethics approach often draws upon these normative ethical theories normative ethical theories can clash when trying to resolve real world ethical dilemmas
one approach attempting to overcome the divide between consequentialism and deontology is case based reasoning also known as casuistry
casuistry does not begin with theory rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case
while casuistry makes use of ethical theory it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning
casuists like albert jonsen and stephen toulmin challenge the traditional paradigm of applied ethics
instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features ought to be considered for that particular case
in their observations of medical ethics committees jonsen and toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case rather than on ideology or theory
thus a rabbi a catholic priest and an agnostic might agree that in this particular case the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions
by focusing on cases and not on theory those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement
applied ethics was later distinguished from the nascent applied epistemology which is also under the umbrella of applied philosophy
while the former was concerned with the practical application of moral considerations the latter focuses on the application of epistemology in solving practical problems
in mathematics the absolute value or modulus of a real number formula is the non negative value without regard to its sign
namely formula if formula is a positive number and formula if formula is negative and for example the absolute value of and the absolute value of is the absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero
generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings
for example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers the quaternions ordered rings fields and vector spaces
the absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude distance and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts
in jean robert argand introduced the term module meaning unit of measure in french specifically for the complex absolute value and it was borrowed into english in as the latin equivalent modulus
the term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least in french and in english
the notation with a vertical bar on each side was introduced by karl weierstrass in
other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude
in programming languages and computational software packages the absolute value of formula is generally represented by codice or a similar expression
the vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts for example when applied to a set it denotes its cardinality when applied to a matrix it denotes its determinant
vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined notably an element of a normed division algebra for example a real number a complex number or a quaternion
a closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the euclidean norm or sup norm of a vector although double vertical bars with subscripts respectively are a more common and less ambiguous notation
for any the absolute value or modulus is denoted with a vertical bar on each side of the quantity and is defined as formula the absolute value is thus always either a positive number or zero but never negative
when formula itself is negative then its absolute value is necessarily positive from an analytic geometry point of view the absolute value of a real number is that numbers distance from zero along the real number line and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them
the notion of an abstract distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference
since the square root symbol represents the unique positive square root when applied to a positive number it follows that formula this is equivalent to the definition above and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers
non negativity positive definiteness and multiplicativity are readily apparent from the definition
to see that subadditivity holds first note that formula with its sign chosen to make the result positive
now since formula it follows that whichever of formula is the value one has formula for all consequently formula as desired
some additional useful properties are given below
these are either immediate consequences of the definition or implied by the four fundamental properties above
these relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values
for example the absolute value as distance from zero is used to define the absolute difference between arbitrary real numbers the standard metric on the real numbers
since the complex numbers are not ordered the definition given at the top for the real absolute value cannot be directly applied to complex numbers
however the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from can be generalised
the absolute value of a complex number is defined by the euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the complex plane from the origin
this can be computed using the pythagorean theorem for any complex number formula where formula and formula are real numbers the absolute value or modulus is and is defined by formula the pythagorean addition of formula and formula where formula and formula denote the real and imaginary parts respectively
when the is zero this coincides with the definition of the absolute value of the when a complex number formula is expressed in its polar form its absolute value since the product of any complex number formula and its with the same absolute value is always the non negative real number the absolute value of a complex number formula is the square root which is therefore called the absolute square or squared modulus formula the complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value
the identity formula is a special case of multiplicativity that is often useful by itself
the real absolute value function is continuous everywhere
it is differentiable everywhere except for
it is monotonically decreasing on the interval and monotonically increasing on the interval
since a real number and its opposite have the same absolute value it is an even function and is hence not invertible
the real absolute value function is a piecewise linear convex function
for both real and complex numbers the absolute value function is idempotent
the absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign whereas the sign function returns a numbers sign irrespective of its value
the following equations show the relationship between these two functions or and for let formula then and the real absolute value function has a derivative for every but is not differentiable at
its derivative for is given by the step function the real absolute value function is an example of a continuous function that achieves a global minimum where the derivative does not exist
the subdifferential of at is the interval
the complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable nowhere because it violates the cauchy riemann equations
the second derivative of with respect to is zero everywhere except zero where it does not exist
as a generalised function the second derivative may be taken as two times the dirac delta function
the antiderivative of the real absolute value function is where is an arbitrary constant of integration
this is not a complex antiderivative because complex antiderivatives can only exist for complex differentiable functions which the complex absolute value function is not
formula if the absolute value is inside a function and formula if another function is inside the absolute value
in the first case the derivative is always discontinuous at formula in the first case and where formula in the second case
the absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance
as noted above the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin along the real number line for real numbers or in the complex plane for complex numbers and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them
the standard euclidean distance between two points and this can be seen as a generalisation since for formula and formula real ie in a space according to the alternative definition of the absolute value and for formula and formula complex numbers ie in a space the above shows that the absolute value distance for real and complex numbers agrees with the standard euclidean distance which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two dimensional euclidean spaces respectively
the definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring
that is if is an element of an ordered ring r then the absolute value of denoted by is defined to be where is the additive inverse of is the additive identity and n
every field f has some extension which is algebraically closed
such an extension is called an algebraically closed extension
among all such extensions there is one and only one which is an algebraic extension of f it is called the algebraic closure of f
the theory of algebraically closed fields has quantifier elimination
anatoly yevgenyevich karpov is a russian and former soviet chess grandmaster former world chess champion and politician
he was the th world chess champion from to a three time fide world champion twice world chess champion as a member of the ussr team and a six time winner of chess olympiads as a member of the ussr team
the international association of chess press awarded him nine chess oscars
karpovs chess tournament successes include over first place finishes
he had a peak elo rating of and his total months at world number one is the fourth longest of all time behind magnus carlsen garry kasparov and emanuel lasker
karpov is also an elected member of the state duma in russia
since he has chaired the commission for ecological safety and environmental protection of the civic chamber of the russian federation and since he has been a member of the public council under the ministry of defence
karpov was born into a russian family on may in zlatoust in the urals region of the former soviet union and learned to play chess at the age of four
his early rise in chess was swift as he became a candidate master by age
at he was accepted into mikhail botvinniks prestigious chess school though botvinnik made the following remark about the young karpov the boy does not have a clue about chess and theres no future at all for him in this profession
karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time and later wrote that the homework botvinnik assigned greatly helped him since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently
karpov improved so quickly under botvinniks tutelage that he became the youngest soviet master in history at the age of fifteen in this tied the record established by boris spassky in
karpov finished first in his first international tournament in tinec several months later ahead of viktor kupreichik
in he won the annual niemeyer tournament in groningen
karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school and entered moscow state university in to study mathematics
he later transferred to leningrad state university eventually graduating from there in economics
one reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach grandmaster semyon furman who lived in leningrad
in his writings karpov credits furman as a major influence on his development as a world class player
in karpov became the first soviet player since spassky to win the world junior championship scoring an undefeated in the final a group at stockholm
this victory earned him the international master title
in karpov tied for fourth and fifth places with pal benko at an international tournament in caracas venezuela and earned the international grandmaster title
fide awarded him the title during its st congress held during the chess olympiad in siegen west germany in september
karpov won the alekhine memorial tournament in moscow ahead of a star studded field for his first significant adult victory
his elo rating shot from in to in during which he shared second place in the soviet championship one point behind spassky and qualified for the leningrad interzonal
karpovs world junior championship qualified him for one of the two interzonals a stage in the world championship cycle to choose the challenger to play world champion bobby fischer
he finished equal first in the leningrad interzonal qualifying for the candidates matches
karpov defeated lev polugaevsky by the score of in the first candidates match earning the right to face former champion boris spassky in the semifinal round
karpov was on record saying that he believed spassky would easily beat him and win the candidates cycle to face fischer and that he would win the following candidates cycle in
spassky won the first game as black in good style but tenacious aggressive play from karpov secured him overall victory by
the candidates final was played in moscow with victor korchnoi
karpov took an early lead winning the second game against the sicilian dragon then scoring another victory in the sixth game
following ten consecutive draws korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give karpov a lead
in game korchnoi succeeded in winning a long endgame then notched a speedy victory after a blunder by karpov two games later
three more draws the last agreed by karpov when he was in a clearly better position closed the match with karpov prevailing entitling him to move on to challenge fischer for the world title
though a world championship match between karpov and fischer was highly anticipated those hopes were never realised
fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins but also that the champion retain the crown if the score was tied
fide the international chess federation refused to allow this proviso and gave both players a deadline of april to agree to play the match under the fide approved rules
when fischer did not agree fide president max euwe declared on april that fischer had forfeited his title and karpov was the new world champion
karpov later attempted to set up another match with fischer but the negotiations fell through
this thrust the young karpov into the role of world champion without having faced the reigning champion
garry kasparov argued that karpov would have had good chances because he had beaten spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional and indeed had higher quality games while fischer had been inactive for three years
this view is echoed by karpov himself
spassky thought that fischer would have won in but karpov would have qualified again and beaten fischer in
karpov has said that if he had had the opportunity to play fischer for the championship in his twenties he could have been a much better player as a result
determined to prove himself a legitimate champion karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years
he convincingly won the milan tournament in and captured his first of three soviet titles in
he created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world
karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories until it was shattered by garry kasparov
as a result most chess professionals soon agreed that karpov was a legitimate world champion
in karpovs first title defence was against viktor korchnoi the opponent he had defeated in the candidates cycle the match was played at baguio philippines with the winner needing six victories
as in karpov took an early lead winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match
when the score was in karpovs favour korchnoi staged a comeback and won three of the next four games to draw level with karpov
karpov then won the very next game to retain the title
three years later korchnoi reemerged as the candidates winner against german finalist robert hbner to challenge karpov in merano italy
karpov handily won this match in what is remembered as the massacre in merano
karpovs tournament career reached a peak at the montreal tournament of stars tournament in where he finished joint first with mikhail tal ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by jan timman ljubomir ljubojevi boris spassky vlastimil hort lajos portisch robert hbner bent larsen and lubomir kavalek
he dominated las palmas in with
he also won the prestigious bugojno tournament in and the linares tournament in and the tilburg tournament in and and the soviet championship in and
karpov represented the soviet union at six chess olympiads in all of which the ussr won the team gold medal
he played as the first reserve at skopje winning the board prize with
at nice he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with
at la valletta he was again board one and scored
at lucerne he scored on board one
at dubai he scored on board two
his last was thessaloniki where on board two he scored
in olympiad play karpov lost only two games out of played
to illustrate karpovs dominance over his peers as champion his score was versus spassky versus robert hbner versus ulf andersson versus vasily smyslov versus mikhail tal versus ljubomir ljubojevi
in karpov lost a candidates match against nigel short
but in the world chess championship karpov reacquired the fide world champion title when kasparov and short split from fide
karpov defeated timman the loser of the candidates final against short
the next major meeting of kasparov and karpov was the linares chess tournament
the field in eventual finishing order was karpov kasparov shirov bareev kramnik lautier anand kamsky topalov ivanchuk gelfand illescas judit polgr and beliavsky with an average elo rating of the highest ever at that time
impressed by the strength of the tournament kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments
perhaps spurred on by this comment karpov played the best tournament of his life
he was undefeated and earned points out of finishing points ahead of second place kasparov and shirov
many of his wins were spectacular
this performance against the best players in the world put his elo rating tournament performance at the highest performance rating of any player in history up until when magnus carlsen won the category xxi pearl spring chess tournament with a performance of
chess statistician jeff sonas considers karpovs linares performance the best tournament result in history
karpov defended his fide title against the rising star gata kamsky in
in fide largely scrapped the old system of candidates matches instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks
in the first of these events the fide world chess championship champion karpov was seeded straight into the final defeating viswanathan anand
in the subsequent cycle the format was changed with the champion having to qualify
karpov refused to defend his title and ceased to be fide world champion after the fide world chess championship
karpovs classical tournament play has been seriously limited since since he prefers to be more involved in russian politics
he had been a member of the supreme soviet commission for foreign affairs and the president of the soviet peace fund before the soviet union dissolved
in addition he has been involved in several disputes with fide
in the september fide rating list he dropped out of the worlds top for the first time
karpov usually limits his play to exhibition events and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess
in he won a match against kasparov defeating him in a rapid time control match
in he tied for first with kasparov in a blitz tournament ahead of korchnoi and judit polgr
karpov and kasparov played a mixed game match from september in valencia spain
it consisted of four rapid and eight blitz games and took place exactly years after the two players legendary encounter at the world chess championship
kasparov won the match
karpov played a match against yasser seirawan in in st
louis missouri an important center of the north american chess scene winning
in november he won the cap dagde rapid tournament that bears his name beating vasyl ivanchuk in the final
in karpov opened his first american chess school in lindsborg kansas
on march the school announced a name change to international chess institute of the midwest due to the russian invasion of ukraine
karpov has been a member of the sixth seventh and eighth russian state dumas
since he has been a member of the public chamber of russia
he has involved himself in several humanitarian causes such as advocating the use of iodised salt
on december karpov supported the law in the russian parliament banning adoption of russian orphans by us citizens
karpov expressed support of the annexation of crimea by the russian federation and accused europe of trying to demonize putin
in august maxim dlugy said that karpov had been waiting since march for the approval of a non immigrant visa to the united states despite frequently visiting the country since
karpov had been scheduled to teach a summer camp at the chess max academy
dlugy said that karpov had been questioned at the us embassy in moscow about whether he planned to communicate with american politicians
karpov was among the russian state duma members placed under sanctions by the eu and uk during the russo ukrainian war
in march after the start of the russian invasion of ukraine the fide council suspended karpovs title of fide ambassador for life
in november karpov was placed in an induced coma after receiving a head injury
karpovs daughter sofia and the russian chess federation said that he had accidentally fallen
karpov made a full recovery from the injury
in march karpov announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of fide
the election took place in september at the th chess olympiad
in may a fundraising event took place in new york with the participation of kasparov and magnus carlsen who both supported his bid and campaigned for him
nigel short also supported karpovs candidacy
on september kirsan ilyumzhinov was reelected as president of fide votes to
karpovs boa constrictor playing style is solidly positional taking minimal risks but reacting mercilessly to the slightest error by his opponent
as a result he is often compared to jos ral capablanca the third world champion
karpov himself describes his style as followslet us say the game may be continued in two ways one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that dont yield to precise calculations the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory
i would choose latter without thinking twice
if the opponent offers keen play i dont object but in such cases i get less satisfaction even if i win than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic
karpovs extensive stamp collection of belgian philately and belgian congo stamps and postal history covering mail from through was sold by david feldmans auction company between december and
he is also known to have large chess stamp and chess book collections
his private chess library consists of books
karpov has authored or co authored several books most of which have been translated into english
the aspect ratio of a geometric shape is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions
for example the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side the ratio of width to height when the rectangle is oriented as a landscape
the aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by a colon less commonly as a simple or decimal fraction
the values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but rather the proportion between width and height
as an example and are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio
in objects of more than two dimensions such as hyperrectangles the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side
for a rectangle the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle
a square has the smallest possible aspect ratio of
for an ellipse the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis
an ellipse with an aspect ratio of is a circle
if the dimension d is fixed then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors
aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as xy
cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a decimal multiple of width vs unit height while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height
in digital images there is a subtle distinction between the display aspect ratio and the storage aspect ratio see distinctions
auto racing is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition
in north america the term is commonly used to describe all forms of automobile sport including non racing disciplines
auto racing has existed since the invention of the automobile
races of various sorts were organized with the first recorded as early as
many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport but soon became an important way for automobile makers to demonstrate their machines
by the s specialist racing cars had developed
there are now numerous different categories each with different rules and regulations
the first prearranged match race of two self powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at am on august between ashton under lyne and old trafford england a distance of
it was won by the carriage of isaac watt boulton
internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline fueled automobiles
the first organized contest was on april by the chief editor of paris publication monsieur fossier
it ran from neuilly bridge to the bois de boulogne
on july the parisian magazine organized what is considered to be the worlds first motoring competition from paris to rouen
one hundred and two competitors paid a franc entrance fee
the first american automobile race is generally considered to be the thanksgiving day chicago times herald race of november
press coverage of the event first aroused significant american interest in the automobile
the targa florio was an open road endurance automobile race held in the mountains of sicily italy near the islands capital of palermo
founded in it was the oldest sports car racing event part of the world sportscar championship between and
the oldest surviving sports car racing event is the hours of le mans begun in
it is run by the automobile club of the west
team ferrari won the race in
with auto construction and racing dominated by france the french automobile club acf staged a number of major international races usually from or to paris connecting with another major city in france or elsewhere in europe
aspendale racecourse in australia was the worlds first purpose built motor racing circuit opening in january
the pear shaped track was close to a mile in length with slightly banked curves and a gravel surface of crushed cement
brooklands in surrey england was the first purpose built banked motor racing venue opening in june
it featured a concrete track with high speed banked corners
one of the oldest existing purpose built automobile racing circuits in the united states still in use is the indianapolis motor speedway in speedway indiana
it is the largest capacity sports venue of any variety worldwide with a top capacity of some seated spectators
nascar was founded by bill france sr on february with the help of several other drivers of the time
the first nascar strictly stock race ever was held on june at daytona beach florida us from sports cars temporarily took a back seat to gt cars with the replacing the world championship for sports cars with the international championship for gt manufacturers
from through nascars premier series was called the winston cup series sponsored by r
reynolds tobacco company cigarette brand winston
the changes that resulted from rjrs involvement as well as the reduction of the schedule from to races a year established as the beginning of nascars modern era
the imsa gt series evolved into the american le mans series which ran its first season in
the european races eventually became the closely related european le mans series both of which mix prototypes and gts
over the last few years auto racing has seen a transformative shift echoing past pivots
the industry much like the cars it champions has had to navigate through the hairpin turns of a global pandemic and a persistent chip shortage each threatening to derail production schedules
at the same time a new course is being charted towards an electric future a dramatic change in direction that is challenging the old guard of gasoline engines
there is also a growing number of events for electric racing cars such as the formula e the eco grand prix or the electric gt championship
in single seater racing the wheels are not covered and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce downforce and enhance adhesion to the track
the two most popular varieties of open wheel road racing are formula one and the indycar series
in europe and asia open wheeled racing is commonly referred to as formula with appropriate hierarchical suffixes
in north america the formula terminology is not followed
the sport is usually arranged to follow an international format a regional format and or a domestic or country specific format
f is a worldwide series that runs only street circuit and race tracks
these cars are heavily based on technology and their aerodynamics
the speed record was set in by juan pablo montoya hitting km h
some of the most prominent races are the monaco grand prix the italian grand prix and the british grand prix
the season ends with the crowning of the world championship for drivers and constructors
in the united states the most popular series is the indycar series
the cars have traditionally been similar to though less technologically sophisticated than f cars with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs
while these cars are not as technologically advanced they are faster mainly because they compete on oval race tracks being able to average a lap at km h
the series biggest race is the indianapolis which is commonly referred to as the greatest spectacle in racing due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single day sporting event
the other major international single seater racing series is formula
regional series include super formula and formula v asia formula renault formula three formula palmer audi and formula atlantic
in the fia formula two championship brought about the revival of the f series
domestic or country specific series include formula three and formula renault with the leading introductory series being formula ford
single seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers
there exist many amateur racing clubs
in the uk the major club series are the monoposto racing club brscc f formula vee and club formula ford
each series caters to a section of the market with some primarily providing low cost racing while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series
there are other categories of single seater racing including kart racing which employs a small low cost machine on small tracks
many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts
formula ford represents the most popular first open wheel category for up and coming drivers stepping up from karts
the series is still the preferred option as it has introduced an aero package and slicks allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer to f
the star mazda series is another entry level series
students at colleges and universities can also take part in single seater racing through the formula sae competition which involves designing and building a single seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition
this also develops other soft skills such as teamwork while promoting motorsport and engineering
the worlds first all female formula racing team was created in
the group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an mtv reality pilot which was shot at mazda raceway laguna seca
in december the fia gave approval to superleague formula racing which debuted in whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as ac milan and liverpool fc after years away from the sport former formula champion jonathan palmer reopened the f category again most drivers have graduated from the formula palmer audi series
the category is officially registered as the fia formula two championship
most rounds have two races and are support races to the fia world touring car championship
touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived four seat race cars
the lesser use of aerodynamics means following cars have a much easier time passing than in open wheel racing
it often features full contact racing with subtle bumping and nudging due to the small speed differentials and large grids
the major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the supercars championship british touring car championship deutsche tourenwagen masters world touring car championship and the world touring car cup
the european touring car cup is a one day event open to super specification touring cars from europes many national championships
the sports car club of americas speed world challenge touring car and gt championships are dominant in north america
americas historic trans am series is undergoing a period of transition but is still the longest running road racing series in the us the national auto sport association also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits
in sports car racing production derived versions of two seat sports cars also known as grand tourers and purpose built sports prototype cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits
the premier championship series of sports car racing is the fia world endurance championship
the main series for gt car racing is the gt world challenge europe divided into two separate championships the gt world challenge europe sprint cup and the gt world challenge europe endurance cup
this series has formed after the folding of the various fia gt championships
other major gt championships include the gt world challenge america gt world challenge asia super gt and the international gt open
there are minor regional and national gt series using mainly gt and gt cars featuring both amateur and professional drivers
sports prototypes unlike gt cars do not rely on road legal cars as a base
they are closed wheel and often closed cockpit purpose built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing
they have much lower weight and more downforce compared to gt cars making them much faster
they are raced in the hours of le mans and in the le mans series asian le mans series and the weathertech sportscar championship
these cars are referred to as lmp cars with lmp being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful lmp cars run by privateer teams
all three le mans series run gt cars in addition to le mans prototypes these cars have different restrictions than the fia gt cars
another prototype and gt racing championship exists in the united states the grand am which began in sanctions its own endurance series the rolex sports car series which consists of slower and lower cost race cars compared to lmp and fia gt cars
the rolex sports car series and american le mans series announced a merger between the two series forming the weathertech sportscar championship starting in
these races are often conducted over long distances at least and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers switching every few hours
due to the performance difference between production based sports cars and purpose built sports prototypes one race usually involves several racing classes each fighting for its own championship
famous sports car races include the hours of le mans the rolex at daytona hours of spa franchorchamps the hours of sebring the hours of watkins glen and the petit le mans at road atlanta
there is also the hours of the nrburgring on the infamous nordschleife track and the dubai hour which is aimed at gt and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro am drivers
production car racing otherwise known as showroom stock in the us is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing mainly used to restrict costs
numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars
most series with a few exceptions follow the group n regulation
there are several different series that are run all over the world most notably japans super taikyu and imsas firehawk series which ran in the s and s all over the united states
in north america stock car racing is the most popular form of auto racing
primarily raced on oval tracks stock cars vaguely resemble production cars but are in fact purpose built racing machines that are built to tight specifications and together with touring cars also called silhouette racing cars
the largest stock car racing governing body is nascar
nascars premier series is the nascar cup series its most famous races being the daytona the southern the coca cola and the brickyard
nascar also runs several feeder series including the xfinity series and craftsman truck series
the series conduct races across the entire continental united states
nascar also sanctions series outside of the united states including the nascar canada series nascar mexico series nascar whelen euro series and nascar brasil sprint race
nascar also governs several smaller regional series such as the whelen modified tour
modified cars are best described as open wheel cars
modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after
a number of modified cars display a manufacturers logo and vehicle name yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer
there are also other stock car governing bodies most notably the automobile racing club of america
in the uk british stock car racing is also referred to as short circuit racing
uk stock car racing started in the s and grew rapidly through the s and s
events take place on shale or tarmac tracks usually around mile long
there are around tracks in the uk and upwards of active drivers
the sport is split into three basic divisions distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing
the most famous championship are the brisca f stock cars
full contact formulas include bangers bombers and rookie bangers and racing features demolition derbies figure of eight and oval racing
semi contact formulas include brisca f f and superstox where bumpers are used tactically
non contact formulas include national hot rods stock rods and lightning rods
one make or single marque championships often employ production based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturers range
there are numerous notable one make formulae from various countries and regions some of which such as the porsche supercup and previously iroc have fostered many distinct national championships
single marque series are often found at the club level to which the production based cars limited modifications and close parity in performance are very well suited
some of the better known single make series are the mini championship the radical european masters john cooper mini challenge clio cup ginettas caterhams bmws and mxs
there are also single chassis single seater formulae such as formula renault and formula bmw usually as feeder series for senior race formula
in drag racing the objective is to complete a given straight line distance from a standing start ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane
this distance is traditionally though has become popular since the s
the vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time depending on the class of racing
vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose built dragster
speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class
average street cars cover the mile in to seconds whereas a top fuel dragster takes seconds or less reaching speeds of up to
drag racing was organized as a sport by wally parks in the early s through the national hot rod association
the nhra was formed to discourage street racing
when launching a top fuel dragster will accelerate at g and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is g more than the space shuttle experiences
a top fuel car can be heard over away and can generate a reading from to on the richter scale
drag racing is two cars head to head the winner proceeding to the next round
professional classes are all first to the finish line wins
sportsman racing is handicapped using an index and cars running under their index break out and lose
the slowest cars bracket racers are also handicapped but rather than an index they use a dial in
in off road racing various classes of specially modified vehicles including cars compete in races through off road environments
in north america these races often take place in the desert such as the famous baja
another format for off road racing happens on closed course short course tracks such as crandon international off road raceway
in the s and s the short course was extended to racing inside stadiums in the mickey thompson entertainment group this format was revived by robby gordon in with his stadium super trucks series
in europe offroad refers to events such as autocross or rallycross while desert races and rally raids such as the paris dakar master rallye or european bajas are called cross country rallies
the modern kart was invented by art ingels a fabricator at the indianapolis car manufacturer kurtis kraft in southern california in
ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube frame chassis weighing less than lb
ingels and everyone else who drove the kart were startled at its performance capabilities
the sport soon blossomed in southern california and quickly spread around the world
although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport kart racing or karting can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right
a large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts often from a very young age such as michael schumacher and fernando alonso
several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport notably wayne rainey who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand controlled kart
as one of the cheapest ways to race karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide
despite their diminutive size karts of the most powerful class superkart and a power output of hp can have a power to weight ratio of hp tonne
without the driver this figure doubles to almost hp tonne
historic motorsport or vintage motorsport uses vehicles limited to a particular era
only safety precautions are modernized in these hobbyist races
a historical event can be of various types of motorsport disciplines from road racing to rallying
because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented reducing corporate sponsorship
the only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing
a historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines
some of the most famous events include the goodwood festival of speed and goodwood revival in britain and monterey historic in the united states
championships range from grass root austin seven racing to the fia thoroughbred grand prix championship for classic formula one chassis
while there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing this branch of auto sport tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach
in many types of auto races particularly those held on closed courses flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors
while individual series have different rules and the flags have changed from the first years these are generally accepted
the worst accident in racing history is the le mans disaster where more than people died including the french driver pierre levegh
in auto racing the racing setup or car setup is the set of adjustments made to the vehicle to optimize its behaviour
adjustments can occur in suspensions brakes transmissions engines tires and many others
aerodynamics and airflow play big roles in the setup of a race car
aerodynamic downforce improves the race cars handling by lowering the center of gravity and distributing the weight of the car equally on each tire
once this is achieved fuel consumption decreases and the forces against the car are significantly lowered
many aerodynamic experiments are conducted in wind tunnels to simulate real life situations while measuring the various drag forces on the car
these rolling roads produce many wind situations and direct air flow at certain speeds and angles
when a diffuser is installed under the car the amount of drag force is significantly lowered and the overall aerodynamics of the vehicle is positively adjusted
wings and canards channel the airflow in the most efficient way to get the least amount of drag from the car
it is experimentally proven that downforce is gained and the vehicles handling is considerably changed when aerodynamic wings on the front and rear of the vehicle are installed
suspension plays a huge part in giving the race car the ability to be driven optimally
shocks are mounted vertically or horizontally to prevent the body from rolling in the corners
the suspension is important because it makes the car stable and easier to control and keeps the tires on the road when driving on uneven terrain
it works in three different ways including vertically longitudinally and laterally to control movement when racing on various tracks
tyres called r compounds are commonly used in motorsports for high amounts of traction
the soft rubber allows them to expand when they are heated up making more surface area on the pavement therefore producing the most traction
these types of tyres do not have grooves on them
tyre pressure is dependent on the temperature of the tyre and track when racing
each time a driver pulls into the pits the tyre pressure and temperature should be tested for optimal performance
when the tyres get too hot they will swell or inflate and need to be deflated to the correct pressure
when the tyres are not warmed up they will not perform as well
brakes on a race car are imperative in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced how many laps are being run track conditions due to weather and how many caution runs require more braking
there are three variables to consider in racing brake pedal displacement brake pedal force and vehicle deceleration
various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness sensitivity and pedal force of the brakes
when using the brakes effectively the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase
these phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure
brake performance is measured in bite and consistency
bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes and they have not warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently
consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking
these two measurements determine the wear of the brakes
the race cars engine needs a considerable amount of air to produce maximum power
the air intake manifold sucks the air from scoops on the hood and front bumper and feeds it into the engine
many engine modifications to increase horsepower and efficiency are commonly used in many racing sanctioning bodies
engines are tuned on a machine called a dynamometer which is commonly known in the racing world as a dyno
the car is driven onto the dyno and many gauges and sensors are hooked up to the car that are controlled by an online program to test force torque or power
through the testing the cars engine maps can be changed to get the most horsepower and ultimately speed out of the vehicle
racing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by the team or by sponsors and can command very substantial salaries
contrary to what may be popularly assumed racing drivers as a group do not have unusually better reflexes or peripheral response time
during repeated physiological evaluations of professional racing drivers the two characteristics that stand out are racers near obsessive need to control their surroundings and an unusual ability to process fast moving information
in this researchers have noted a strong correlation between racers psychological profiles and those of fighter pilots
in tests comparing racers to members of the general public the greater the complexity of the information processing matrix the greater the speed gap between racers and the public
due partly to the performance capabilities of modern racing cars racing drivers require a high level of fitness focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment
racing drivers mainly complain about pains in the lumbar shoulder and neck regions
racing drivers experience extremely large g forces because formula cars and sports prototypes generate more downforce and are able to corner at significantly higher speeds
formula drivers routinely experience g loadings in excess of g
anarcho capitalism is an anti statist libertarian political philosophy and economic theory that seeks to abolish centralized states in favor of stateless societies with systems of private property enforced by private agencies based on concepts such as the non aggression principle free markets and self ownership
an anarcho capitalist philosophy extends the concept of ownership to include control of private property as part of the self and in some cases control of other people as private property
in the absence of statute anarcho capitalists hold that society tends to contractually self regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a voluntary society involving the voluntary exchange of goods and services
in a theoretical anarcho capitalist society a system of private property would still exist and would be enforced by private defense agencies and or insurance companies that were selected by property owners whose ownership rights or claims would be enforced by private defence agencies and or insurance companies
according to its proponents various historical theorists have espoused philosophies similar to anarcho capitalism
while the earliest extant attestation of anarchocapitalism is in karl hesss essay the death of politics published by playboy in march american economist murray rothbard was credited with coining the terms anarcho capitalist and anarcho capitalism in
a leading figure in the th century american libertarian movement rothbard synthesized elements from the austrian school classical liberalism and th century american individualist anarchists and mutualists lysander spooner and benjamin tucker while rejecting the labor theory of value
rothbards anarcho capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed upon legal code which would be generally accepted and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow
this legal code would recognize contracts between individuals private property self ownership and tort law in keeping with the non aggression principle
anyone who disagreed with the legal code would ultimately be subject to enforcement measures such as those utilised by a state
rothbard views the power of the state as unjustified arguing that it restricts individual rights and prosperity and creates social and economic problems
anarcho capitalists and right libertarians cite several historical precedents of what they believe to be examples of quasi anarcho capitalism including the republic of cospaia acadia anglo saxon england medieval iceland the american old west gaelic ireland and merchant law admiralty law and early common law
anarcho capitalism is distinguished from minarchism which advocates a minimal governing body and from objectivism
unlike most anarchists anarcho capitalists support private property and private institutions
anarcho capitalism developed from radical american anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism
a strong current within anarchism does not consider anarcho capitalism to be part of the anarchist movement because they argue that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms
according to several scholars anarcho capitalism lies outside the tradition of the vast majority of anarchist schools of thought and is more closely affiliated with capitalism right libertarianism and neoliberalism
social anarchists oppose and reject capitalism and consider anarcho capitalism to be a contradiction in terms although some including anarcho capitalists and right libertarians consider anarcho capitalism to be a form of anarchism
according to the encyclopdia britannicaanarcho capitalism is occasionally seen as part of the new right
author j michael oliver says that during the s a philosophical movement arose in the us that championed reason ethical egoism and free market capitalism
according to oliver anarcho capitalism is a political theory which logically follows the philosophical conclusions of objectivism a philosophical system developed by ayn rand but he acknowledges that his advocacy of anarcho capitalism is quite at odds with rands ardent defense of limited government
professor lisa duggan also says that rands anti statist pro free market stances went on to shape the politics of anarcho capitalism
according to patrik schumacher the political ideology and programme of anarcho capitalism envisages the radicalization of the neoliberal rollback of the state and calls for the extension of entrepreneurial freedom and competitive market rationality to the point where the scope for private enterprise is all encompassing and leaves no space for state action whatsoever
anarcho capitalists oppose the state and seek to privatize any useful service the government presently provides such as education infrastructure or the enforcement of law
they see capitalism and the free market as the basis for a free and prosperous society
murray rothbard stated that the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism is the difference between peaceful voluntary exchange and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market
rothbard argued that all government services including defense are inefficient because they lack a market based pricing mechanism regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in
maverick edwards of the liberty university describes anarcho capitalism as a political social and economic theory that places markets as the central governing body and where government no longer grants rights to its citizenry
writer stanisaw wjtowicz says that although anarcho capitalists are against centralized states they hold that all people would naturally share and agree to a specific moral theory based on the non aggression principle
while the friedmanian formulation of anarcho capitalism is robust to the presence of violence and in fact assumes some degree of violence will occur anarcho capitalism as formulated by rothbard and others holds strongly to the central libertarian nonaggression axiom sometimes non aggression principle
rothbard wrote rothbards defense of the self ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives namely that either a group of people can own another group of people or that no single person has full ownership over ones self
rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic ie a just natural law that can govern all people independent of place and time
the only alternative that remains to rothbard is self ownership which he believes is both axiomatic and universal
in general the non aggression axiom is described by rothbard as a prohibition against the initiation of force or the threat of force against persons or property
the initiation of force is usually referred to as aggression or coercion
the difference between anarcho capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom
minarchist libertarians such as libertarian political parties would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form retaining at the very least public police courts and military
however others might give further allowance for other government programs
in contrast rothbard rejects any level of state intervention defining the state as a coercive monopoly and as the only entity in human society excluding acknowledged criminals that derives its income entirely from coercion in the form of taxation which rothbard describes as compulsory seizure of the property of the states inhabitants or subjects
some anarcho capitalists such as rothbard accept the non aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis
it is in terms of the non aggression principle that rothbard defined his interpretation of anarchism a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression against person and property and wrote that what anarchism proposes to do then is to abolish the state ie to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion
in an interview published in the american libertarian journal the new banner rothbard stated that capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism
anarcho capitalists postulate the privatization of everything including cities with all their infrastructures public spaces streets and urban management systems
central to rothbardian anarcho capitalism are the concepts of self ownership and original appropriation that combines personal and private property
hans hermann hoppe wrote rothbard however rejected the lockean proviso and followed the rule of first come first served without any consideration of how much resources are left for other individuals
anarcho capitalists advocate private ownership of the means of production and the allocation of the product of labor created by workers within the context of wage labour and the free market that is through decisions made by property and capital owners regardless of what an individual needs or does not need
original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never before used resources including land and by improving or otherwise using it own it with the same absolute right as their own body and retaining those rights forever regardless of whether the resource is still being used by them
according to rothbard property can only come about through labor therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around itit is only by using land and by mixing ones labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be
rothbard argued that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the persons property as for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource it remains his owned land
his labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land and the land is therefore his or his assigns in perpetuity
in justice and property rights rothbard wrote that any identifiable owner must be accorded his property
in the case of slavery rothbard claimed that in many cases the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified and the reparations can become highly specific indeed
rothbard believed slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the homestead principle
if property is held by the state rothbard advocated its confiscation and return to the private sector writing that any property in the hands of the state is in the hands of thieves and should be liberated as quickly as possible
rothbard proposed that state universities be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle
rothbard also supported the expropriation of nominally private property if it is the result of state initiated force such as businesses that receive grants and subsidies
rothbard further proposed that businesses who receive at least of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers writing what we libertarians object to then is not government per se but crime what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles what we are for is not private property per se but just innocent non criminal private property
similarly karl hess wrote that libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend willy nilly all property which now is called private
much of that property is stolen
much is of dubious title
all of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral coercive state system
anarchists view capitalism as an inherently authoritarian and hierarchical system and seek the abolishment of private property
there is disagreement between anarchists and anarcho capitalists as the former generally rejects anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism and considers anarcho capitalism a contradiction in terms while the latter holds that the abolishment of private property would require expropriation which is counterproductive to order and would require a state
as opposed to anarchists most anarcho capitalists reject the commons
however some of them propose that non state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho capitalist society
for anarcho capitalists what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from what they call the compulsory state
deontological anarcho capitalists believe that the only just and most economically beneficial way to acquire property is through voluntary trade gift or labor based original appropriation rather than through aggression or fraud
anarcho capitalists state that there could be cases where common property may develop in a lockean natural rights framework
anarcho capitalists make the example of a number of private businesses which may arise in an area each owning the land and buildings that they use but they argue that the paths between them become cleared and trodden incrementally through customer and commercial movement
these thoroughfares may become valuable to the community but according to them ownership cannot be attributed to any single person and original appropriation does not apply because many contributed the labor necessary to create them
in order to prevent it from falling to the tragedy of the commons anarcho capitalists suggest transitioning from common to private property wherein an individual would make a homesteading claim based on disuse acquire title by the assent of the community consensus form a corporation with other involved parties or other means
american economist randall g
holcombe sees challenges stemming from the idea of common property under anarcho capitalism such as whether an individual might claim fishing rights in the area of a major shipping lane and thereby forbid passage through it
in contrast hoppes work on anarcho capitalist theory is based on the assumption that all property is privately held including all streets rivers airports and harbors which forms the foundation of his views on immigration
some anarcho capitalists strongly oppose intellectual property
stephan n
kinsella argues that ownership only relates to tangible assets
the society envisioned by anarcho capitalists has been labelled by them as a contractual society which rothbard described as a society based purely on voluntary action entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence the system relies on contracts between individuals as the legal framework which would be enforced by private police and security forces as well as private arbitrations
rothbard argues that limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract arguing that orporations are not at all monopolistic privileges they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital
on the purely free market those men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation
there are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho capitalism
rothbard believes that the right to contract is based in inalienable rights and because of this any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will preventing a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured slavery
that restriction aside the right to contract under anarcho capitalist order would be pretty broad
for example rothbard went as far as to justify stork markets arguing that a market in guardianship rights would facilitate the transfer of guardianship from abusive or neglectful parents to those more interested or suited to raising children
other anarcho capitalists have also suggested the legalization of organ markets as in irans renal market
other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract
included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others
while anarchists criticize wage labour describing it as wage slavery anarcho capitalists view it as a consensual contract
some anarcho capitalists prefer to see self employment prevail over wage labor
david d
friedman has expressed a preference for a society where almost everyone is self employed and instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade not authority
each sells not his time but what his time produces
different anarcho capitalists propose different forms of anarcho capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law
in the market for liberty morris and linda tannehill object to any statutory law whatsoever
they argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another in order to decide if an act is right or wrong
however while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow as he presumes a high degree of convergence amongst individuals about what constitutes natural justice
unlike both the tannehills and rothbard who see an ideological commonality of ethics and morality as a requirement david d
friedman proposes that the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market just as books and bras are produced today
there could be competition among different brands of law just as there is competition among different brands of cars
friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society remains to be proven
he says it is a possibility that very un libertarian laws may result such as laws against drugs but he thinks this would be rare
he reasons that if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims that law
will not survive in an anarcho capitalist society
anarcho capitalists only accept the collective defense of individual liberty insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis
however their complaint is not just that the states defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical forcethat is they believe it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security such as a police judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors
anarcho capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it but not private individuals a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors
if competition in security provision were allowed to exist prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho capitalists
according to molinari under a regime of liberty the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries
proponents believe that private systems of justice and defense already exist naturally forming where the market is allowed to compensate for the failure of the state namely private arbitration security guards neighborhood watch groups and so on
these private courts and police are sometimes referred to generically as private defense agencies
the defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on taxation or by cooperative self help by groups of individuals
edward stringham argues that private adjudication of disputes could enable the market to internalize externalities and provide services that customers desire
rothbard stated that the american revolutionary war and the war of southern secession were the only two just wars in american military history
some anarcho capitalists such as rothbard feel that violent revolution is counter productive and prefer voluntary forms of economic secession to the extent possible
retributive justice is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho capitalist society
according to matthew okeefee some anarcho capitalists believe prisons or indentured servitude would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho capitalist property relations while others believe exile or forced restitution are sufficient
rothbard stressed the importance of restitution as the primary focus of a libertarian legal order and advocated for corporal punishment for petty vandals and the death penalty for murders
american economist bruce l
benson argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime
benson gives the example of a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock
even if caught before taking anything benson argues that the thief would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights
benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would in all likelihood be established through precedent allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses
morris and linda tannehill raise a similar example saying that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees and customers lives and safety in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the tellers call for help
however they believe that the robbers loss of reputation would be even more damaging
they suggest that specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record provided they trust the veracity of the companies records
they further theorise that the bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him
murray rothbard has listed different ideologies of which his interpretations he said have influenced anarcho capitalism
this includes his interpretation of anarchism and more precisely individualist anarchism classical liberalism and the austrian school of economic thought
scholars additionally associate anarcho capitalism with neo classical liberalism radical neoliberalism and right libertarianism
in both its social and individualist forms anarchism is usually considered an anti capitalist and radical left wing or far left movement that promotes libertarian socialist economic theories such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism
because anarchism is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti capitalism and socialism anarchists believe that capitalism is incompatible with social and economic equality and therefore do not recognize anarcho capitalism as an anarchist school of thought
in particular anarchists argue that capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which is incompatible with an anarchist society
the usage of libertarian is also in dispute
while both anarchists and anarcho capitalists have used it libertarian was synonymous with anarchist until the mid th century when anarcho capitalist theory developed
anarcho capitalists are distinguished from the dominant anarchist tradition by their relation to property and capital
while both anarchism and anarcho capitalism share general antipathy towards government authority anarcho capitalism favors free market capitalism
anarchists including egoists such as max stirner have supported the protection of an individuals freedom from powers of both government and private property owners
in contrast while condemning governmental encroachment on personal liberties anarcho capitalists support freedoms based on private property rights
anarcho capitalist theorist murray rothbard argued that protesters should rent a street for protest from its owners
the abolition of public amenities is a common theme in some anarcho capitalist writings
as anarcho capitalism puts laissez faire economics before economic equality it is commonly viewed as incompatible with the anti capitalist and egalitarian tradition of anarchism
although anarcho capitalist theory implies the abolition of the state in favour of a fully laissez faire economy it lies outside the tradition of anarchism
while using the language of anarchism anarcho capitalism only shares anarchisms antipathy towards the state and not anarchisms antipathy towards hierarchy as theorists expect from anarcho capitalist economic power relations
it follows a different paradigm from anarchism and has a fundamentally different approach and goals
in spite of the anarcho in its title anarcho capitalism is more closely affiliated with capitalism right libertarianism and liberalism than with anarchism
some within this laissez faire tradition reject the designation of anarcho capitalism believing that capitalism may either refer to the laissez faire market they support or the government regulated system that they oppose
rothbard argued that anarcho capitalism is the only true form of anarchismthe only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he maintained that any other form presupposes authoritarian enforcement of a political ideology such as redistribution of private property which he attributed to anarchism
according to this argument the capitalist free market is the natural situation that would result from people being free from state authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society such as cooperatives non profit organizations businesses and so on
moreover anarcho capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term left wing anarchists would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it
based on their understanding and interpretation of anarchism in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital which they believe is a goal of anarchists there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people
they conclude that this theoretical body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state
the difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho capitalist system is what anarcho capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under what they describe as a coercively egalitarian anarchist system
rothbard also argued that the capitalist system of today is not properly anarchistic because it often colludes with the state
according to rothbard what marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term
these two contradictory concepts are what i would call free market capitalism on the one hand and state capitalism on the other
the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism writes rothbard is precisely the difference between on the one hand peaceful voluntary exchange and on the other violent expropriation
he continues state capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble
traditional anarchists reject the notion of capitalism hierarchies and private property
albert meltzer argued that anarcho capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee
anna morgenstern approaches this topic from the opposite perspective arguing that anarcho capitalists are not really capitalists because mass concentration of capital is impossible without the state
according to jeremy jennings t is hard not to conclude that these ideas referring to anarcho capitalism have roots deep in classical liberalism and are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is
for jennings anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual but as we have already seen for the extension of individuality and community
similarly barbara goodwin emeritus professor of politics at the university of east anglia norwich argues that anarcho capitalisms true place is in the group of right wing libertarians not in anarchism
some right libertarian scholars like michael huemer who identify with the ideology describe anarcho capitalism as a variety of anarchism
british author andrew heywood also believes that individualist anarchism overlaps with libertarianism and is usually linked to a strong belief in the market as a self regulating mechanism most obviously manifest in the form of anarcho capitalism
frank h
brooks author of the individualist anarchists an anthology of liberty believes that anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism from the hyperrationalism of godwin to the egoism of stirner to the libertarians and anarcho capitalists of today
while both anarchism and anarcho capitalism are in opposition to the state it is a necessary but not sufficient condition because anarchists and anarcho capitalists interpret state rejection differently
austrian school economist david prychitko in the context of anarcho capitalism says that while society without a state is necessary for full fledged anarchy it is nevertheless insufficient
according to ruth kinna anarcho capitalists are anti statists who draw more on right wing liberal theory and the austrian school than anarchist traditions
kinna writes that n order to highlight the clear distinction between the two positions anarchists describe anarcho capitalists as propertarians
anarcho capitalism is usually seen as part of the new right
some anarcho capitalists argue that according to them anarchists consider the word anarchy as to be the antithesis of hierarchy and therefore that anarcho capitalism is sometimes considered to be a term with differences philosophically to what they personally consider to be true anarchism as an anarcho capitalist society would inherently contain hierarchy
additionally rothbard discusses the difference between government and governance thus proponents of anarcho capitalism think the philosophys common name is indeed consistent as it promotes private governance but is vehemently anti government
historian and libertarian ralph raico argued that what liberal philosophers had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism or as it would be called today anarcho capitalism or market anarchism
he also said that gustave de molinari was proposing a doctrine of the private production of security a position which was later taken up by murray rothbard
some anarcho capitalists consider molinari to be the first proponent of anarcho capitalism
in the preface to the english translation by murray rothbard called the production of security the first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho capitalism although admitting that molinari did not use the terminology and probably would have balked at the name
hans hermann hoppe said that the article the production of security is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho capitalism
according to hans hermann hoppe one of the th century precursors of anarcho capitalism were philosopher herbert spencer classical liberal auberon herbert and liberal socialist franz oppenheimer
ruth kinna credits murray rothbard with coining the term anarcho capitalism which is kinna proposes to describe a commitment to unregulated private property and laissez faire economics prioritizing the liberty rights of individuals unfettered by government regulation to accumulate consume and determine the patterns of their lives as they see fit
according to kinna anarcho capitalists will sometimes label themselves market anarchists because they recognize the negative connotations of capitalism
but the literature of anarcho capitalism draws on classical liberal theory particularly the austrian school friedrich von hayek and ludwig von mises rather than recognizable anarchist traditions
ayn rands laissez faire anti government corporate philosophy objectivism is sometimes associated with anarcho capitalism
other scholars similarly associate anarcho capitalism with anti state classical liberalism neo classical liberalism radical neoliberalism and right libertarianism
paul dragos aligica writes that there is a foundational difference between the classical liberal and the anarcho capitalist positions
classical liberalism while accepting critical arguments against collectivism acknowledges a certain level of public ownership and collective governance as necessary to provide practical solutions to political problems
in contrast anarcho capitalism according to aligica denies any requirement for any form of public administration and allows no meaningful role for the public sphere which is seen as sub optimal and illegitimate
murray rothbard a student of ludwig von mises stated that he was influenced by the work of the th century american individualist anarchists
in the winter of rothbard decided to reject minimal state laissez faire and embrace his interpretation of individualist anarchism
in rothbard wrote that lysander spooner and benjamin r
tucker were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy
however rothbard thought that they had a faulty understanding of economics as the th century individualist anarchists had a labor theory of value as influenced by the classical economists while rothbard was a student of austrian school economics which does not agree with the labor theory of value
rothbard sought to meld th century american individualist anarchists advocacy of economic individualism and free markets with the principles of austrian school economics arguing that is in the body of thought known as austrian economics a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social weltanschauung
rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected
tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it
peter marshall states that anarcho capitalism overlooks the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist anarchists like spooner and tucker
stephanie silberstein states that while spooner was no free market capitalist nor an anarcho capitalist he was not as opposed to capitalism as most socialists were
in the spooner tucker doctrine an economists view rothbard explained his disagreements
rothbard disagreed with tucker that it would cause the money supply to increase because he believed that the money supply in a free market would be self regulating
if it were not then rothbard argued inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place
rothbard claimed that tucker was wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because he believed people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated
tucker held a labor theory of value and thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that exploitation or usury was taking place if they were not
as tucker explained in state socialism and anarchism his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow the proliferation of new businesses which would in turn raise demand for labor
this led tucker to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay
as an austrian school economist rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to marginal utility rather than to labor amounts in the free market
as opposed to tucker he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces
without the labor theory of value some argue that th century individualist anarchists approximate the modern movement of anarcho capitalism although this has been contested or rejected
as economic theory changed the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neoclassical economics and rothbard combined mises austrian school of economics with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist american anarchists of the th century such as tucker and spooner
in the mid s rothbard wrote an unpublished article named are libertarians anarchists under the pseudonym aubrey herbert concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of anarchists including the individualist anarchists of the th century concluding that we are not anarchists and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground and are being completely unhistorical
on the other hand it is clear that we are not archists either we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive
perhaps then we could call ourselves by a new name nonarchist
joe peacott an american individualist anarchist in the mutualist tradition criticizes anarcho capitalists for trying to hegemonize the individualist anarchism label and make appear as if all individualist anarchists are in favor of capitalism
peacott states that individualists both past and present agree with the communist anarchists that present day capitalism is based on economic coercion not on voluntary contract
rent and interest are the mainstays of modern capitalism and are protected and enforced by the state
without these two unjust institutions capitalism could not exist
anarchist activists and scholars do not consider anarcho capitalism as a part of the anarchist movement arguing that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and see it as incompatible with capitalist forms
although some regard anarcho capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism many others disagree or contest the existence of an individualist socialist divide
in coming to terms that anarchists mostly identified with socialism rothbard wrote that individualist anarchism is different from anarcho capitalism and other capitalist theories due to the individualist anarchists retaining the labor theory of value and socialist doctrines
similarly many writers deny that anarcho capitalism is a form of anarchism or that capitalism is compatible with anarchism
the palgrave handbook of anarchism writes that benjamin franks rightly points out individualisms that defend or reinforce hierarchical forms such as the economic power relations of anarcho capitalism are incompatible with practices of social anarchism based on developing immanent goods which contest such as inequalities
laurence davis cautiously asks a jew ceased to be a jew upon baptism
from the perspective of racial antisemitism however the assimilated jew was still a jew even after baptism
from the enlightenment onward it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews
once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable even before explicitly racist doctrines appear
some christians such as the catholic priest ernest jouin who published the first french translation of the protocols combined religious and racial antisemitism as in his statement that from the triple viewpoint of race of nationality and of religion the jew has become the enemy of humanity
the virulent antisemitism of douard drumont one of the most widely read catholic writers in france during the dreyfus affair likewise combined religious and racial antisemitism
drumont founded the antisemitic league of france
the underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by jews
linking jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting antisemitic canards
antisemites claim that jews control the world finances a theory promoted in the fraudulent the protocols of the elders of zion and later repeated by henry ford and his the dearborn independent
in the modern era such myths continue to be spread in books such as the secret relationship between blacks and jews published by the nation of islam and on the internet
gerald krefetz summarizes the myth as control the banks the money supply the economy and businesses of the community of the country of the world
krefetz gives as illustrations many slurs and proverbs which suggest that jews are stingy or greedy or miserly or aggressive bargainers
during the nineteenth century jews were described as scurrilous stupid and tight fisted but after the jewish emancipation and the rise of jews to the middle or upper class in europe were portrayed as clever devious and manipulative financiers out to dominate blew into the studio on a windy november night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful mcnally told katz

this page lists some links to ancient philosophy namely philosophical thought extending as far as early post classical history
genuine philosophical thought depending upon original individual insights arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously
karl jaspers termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the th century bce and concluding around the rd century bce an axial age in human thought
in western philosophy the spread of christianity in the roman empire marked the ending of hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of medieval philosophy whereas in the middle east the spread of islam through the arab empire marked the end of old iranian philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of early islamic philosophy
see also dualism dualism while there are ancient relations between the indian vedas and the iranian avesta the two main families of the indo iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human beings position in society and their view of mans role in the universe
the first charter of human rights by cyrus the great as understood in the cyrus cylinder is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by zarathustra and developed in zoroastrian schools of thought of the achaemenid era of iranian history
ideas and tenets of zoroastrian schools of early persian philosophy are part of many works written in middle persian and of the extant scriptures of the zoroastrian religion in avestan language
among these are treatises such as the shikand gumanic vichar by mardan farrux ohrmazddadan selections of denkard wizidagh ztspram as well as older passages of the book avesta the gathas which are attributed to zarathustra himself and regarded as his direct teachings
anacharsis the ancient indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions the vedic tradition and the ramaa tradition
indian philosophy begins with the vedas wherein questions pertaining to laws of nature the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked
in the famous rigvedic hymn of creation the poet asks in the vedic view creation is ascribed to the self consciousness of the primeval being
this leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things

jainism and buddhism are continuation of the sramana school of thought

crvka philosophy also known as lokyata it is a system of hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference
it is named after its founder crvka author of the brhaspatya stras
in classical times these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy
some of the questions asked were chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in china and other countries within the east asian cultural sphere that share a common language including japan korea and vietnam
the hundred schools of thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the th century to bce an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in china
even though this period known in its earlier part as the spring and autumn period and the warring states period in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles it is also known as the golden age of chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely
the thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in east asian countries
the intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government war and diplomacy
this period ended with the rise of the qin dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent
the book of han lists ten major schools they are the founder of the qin dynasty who implemented legalism as the official philosophy quashed mohist and confucianist schools
legalism remained influential until the emperors of the han dynasty adopted daoism and later confucianism as official doctrine
these latter two became the determining forces of chinese thought until the introduction of buddhism
confucianism was particularly strong during the han dynasty whose greatest thinker was dong zhongshu who integrated confucianism with the thoughts of the zhongshu school and the theory of the five elements
he also was a promoter of the new text school which considered confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of china who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the universal peace
in contrast there was an old text school that advocated the use of confucian works written in ancient language that were so much more reliable
in particular they refuted the assumption of confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage but simply a human and mortal
the rd and th centuries saw the rise of the xuanxue also called neo taoism
the most important philosophers of this movement were wang bi xiang xiu and guo xiang
the main question of this school was whether being came before not being
a peculiar feature of these taoist thinkers like the seven sages of the bamboo grove was the concept of feng liu a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse
buddhism arrived in china around the st century ad but it was not until the northern and southern sui and tang dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement
at the beginning it was considered a sort of taoist sect and there was even a theory about laozi founder of taoism who went to india and taught his philosophy to buddha
mahayana buddhism was far more successful in china than its rival hinayana and both indian schools and local chinese sects arose from the th century
two chiefly important monk philosophers were sengzhao and daosheng
but probably the most influential and original of these schools was the chan sect which had an even stronger impact in japan as the zen sect
anaximander was a pre socratic greek philosopher who lived in miletus a city of ionia
he belonged to the milesian school and learned the teachings of his master thales
he succeeded thales and became the second master of that school where he counted anaximenes and arguably pythagoras amongst his pupils
little of his life and work is known today
according to available historical documents he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies although only one fragment of his work remains
fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man
anaximander was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe with a particular interest in its origins claiming that nature is ruled by laws just like human societies and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long
like many thinkers of his time anaximanders philosophy included contributions to many disciplines
in astronomy he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the earth
in physics his postulation that the indefinite was the source of all things led greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction
his knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in greece
he created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography
anaximander was also involved in the politics of miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies
anaximander son of praxiades was born in the third year of the nd olympiad
according to apollodorus of athens greek grammarian of the nd century bc he was sixty four years old during the second year of the th olympiad and died shortly afterwards
establishing a timeline of his work is impossible since no document provides chronological references
themistius a th century byzantine rhetorician mentions that he was the first of the known greeks to publish a written document on nature
therefore his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose at least in the western world
by the time of plato his philosophy was almost forgotten and aristotle his successor theophrastus and a few doxographers provide us with the little information that remains
however we know from aristotle that thales also from miletus precedes anaximander
it is debatable whether thales actually was the teacher of anaximander but there is no doubt that anaximander was influenced by thales theory that everything is derived from water
one thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient greeks considered anaximander to be from the monist school which began in miletus with thales followed by anaximander and which ended with anaximenes
rd century roman rhetorician aelian depicts anaximander as leader of the milesian colony to apollonia on the black sea coast and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen
indeed various history explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters
it is very likely that leaders of miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colonys allegiance
anaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the persian achaemenid empire
anaximanders theories were influenced by the greek mythical tradition and by some ideas of thales the father of western philosophy as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the near east especially babylon
all these were developed rationally
in his desire to find some universal principle he assumed like traditional religion the existence of a cosmic order and his ideas on this used the old language of myths which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality
this was a common practice for the greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system
some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period in the greek city states
this has given rise to the phrase greek miracle
but there may not have been such an abrupt break as initially appears
the basic elements of nature which the first greek philosophers believed made up the universe in fact represent the primordial forces imagined in earlier ways of thinking
their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony
in the old cosmogonies hesiod and pherecydes zeus establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony
anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not monarchic but geometric and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe
this is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature
in this space there is isonomy and all the forces are symmetrical and transferable
the decisions are now taken by the assembly of demos in the agora which is lying in the middle of the city
the same rational way of thought led him to introduce the abstract apeiron as an origin of the universe a concept that is probably influenced by the original chaos from which everything else appeared in the mythical greek cosmogony
it also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements
origin then must be something else unlimited in its source that could create without experiencing decay so that genesis would never stop
the refutation attributed to hippolytus of rome and the later th century byzantine philosopher simplicius of cilicia attribute to anaximander the earliest use of the word apeiron to designate the original principle
he was the first philosopher to employ in a philosophical context the term arch which until then had meant beginning or origin
that anaximander called this something by the name of is the natural interpretation of what theophrastos says the current statement that the term was introduced by him appears to be due to a misunderstanding
and hippolytos however is not an independent authority and the only question is what theophrastos wrote
for him it became no longer a mere point in time but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be
the indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in homer and as in xenophanes who said that the earth went down indefinitely ie beyond the imagination or concept of men
nearly all we know of anaximanders system is derived in the last resort from theophrastos who certainly knew his book
he seems once at least to have quoted anaximanders own words and he criticised his style
here are the remains of what he said of him in the first book anaximander of miletos son of praxiades a fellow citizen and associate of thales said that the material cause and first element of things was the infinite he being the first to introduce this name of the material cause
he says it is neither water nor any other of the so called elements but a substance different from them which is infinite or from which arise all the heavens and the worlds within them
phys op
burnets quote from the first book is his translation of theophrastos physic opinion fragment as it appears in p
of historia philosophiae graecae by ritter and preller and section of doxographi graeci by diels
by ascribing the infinite with a material cause theophrastos is following the aristotelian tradition of nearly always discussing the facts from the point of view of his own system
aristotle writes that the pre socratics were searching for the element that constitutes all things
while each pre socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless unlimited primordial mass subject to neither old age nor decay that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived
he proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher thales who had claimed that the primary substance was water
the notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and anaximanders description was in terms appropriate to this conception
this arch is called eternal and ageless
refutation iidk b aristotle puts things in his own way regardless of historical considerations and it is difficult to see that it is more of an anachronism to call the boundless intermediate between the elements than to say that it is distinct from the elements
indeed if once we introduce the elements at all the former description is the more adequate of the two
at any rate if we refuse to understand these passages as referring to anaximander we shall have to say that aristotle paid a great deal of attention to some one whose very name has been lost and who not only agreed with some of anaximanders views but also used some of his most characteristic expressions
we may add that in one or two places aristotle certainly seems to identify the intermediate with the something distinct from the elements
it is certain that he cannot have said anything about elements which no one thought of before empedokles and no one could think of before parmenides
the question has only been mentioned because it has given rise to a lengthy controversy and because it throws light on the historical value of aristotles statements
from the point of view of his own system these may be justified but we shall have to remember in other cases that when he seems to attribute an idea to some earlier thinker we are not bound to take what he says in an historical sense
for anaximander the principle of things the constituent of all substances is nothing determined and not an element such as water in thales view
neither is it something halfway between air and water or between air and fire thicker than air and fire or more subtle than water and earth
anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature for example water can only be wet never dry and therefore cannot be the one primary substance nor could any of the other candidates
he postulated the apeiron as a substance that although not directly perceptible to us could explain the opposites he saw around him
if thales had been right in saying that water was the fundamental reality it would not be easy to see how anything else could ever have existed
one side of the opposition the cold and moist would have had its way unchecked and the warm and dry would have been driven from the field long ago
we must then have something not itself one of the warring opposites something more primitive out of which they arise and into which they once more pass away
anaximander explains how the four elements of ancient physics are formed and how earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions
unlike other pre socratics he never defines this principle precisely and it has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos
according to him the universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter
it embraces the opposites of hot and cold wet and dry and directs the movement of things an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in all the worlds
anaximander taught then that there was an eternal
the indestructible something out of which everything arises and into which everything returns a boundless stock from which the waste of existence is continually made good elements
that is only the natural development of the thought we have ascribed to thales and there can be no doubt that anaximander at least formulated it distinctly
indeed we can still follow to some extent the reasoning which led him to do so
thales had regarded water as the most likely thing to be that of which all others are forms anaximander appears to have asked how the primary substance could be one of these particular things
his argument seems to be preserved by aristotle who has the following passage in his discussion of the infinite further there cannot be a single simple body which is infinite either as some hold one distinct from the elements which they then derive from it or without this qualification
for there are some who make this
the infinite and not air or water in order that the other things may not be destroyed by their infinity
they are in opposition one to another
air is cold water moist and fire hot
and therefore if any one of them were infinite the rest would have ceased to be by this time
accordingly they say that what is infinite is something other than the elements and from it the elements arise
aristotle physics
f b historia philosophiae graecae section b
anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came
the one surviving fragment of anaximanders writing deals with this matter
simplicius transmitted it as a quotation which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements whence things have their origin thence also their destruction happens according to necessity for they give to each other justice and recompense for their injustice in conformity with the ordinance of time
simplicius mentions that anaximander said all these in poetic terms meaning that he used the old mythical language
the goddess justice keeps the cosmic order
this concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards notably by aristotle and by the greek tragedian euripides what comes from earth must return to earth
friedrich nietzsche in his philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks stated that anaximander viewed
all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance
physicist max born in commenting upon werner heisenbergs arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of quantum mechanics are to be seen as different manifestations different quantum states of one and the same primordial substance proposed that this primordial substance be called apeiron
anaximander was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world
in his model the earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite not supported by anything
it remains in the same place because of its indifference a point of view that aristotle considered ingenious in on the heavens
its curious shape is that of a cylinder with a height one third of its diameter
the flat top forms the inhabited world
carlo rovelli suggests that anaximander took the idea of the earths shape as a floating disk from thales who had imagined the earth floating in water the immense ocean from which everything is born and upon which the earth floats
anaximander was then able to envisage the earth at the centre of an infinite space in which case it required no support as there was nowhere down to fall
in rovellis view the shape a cylinder or a sphere is unimportant compared to the appreciation of a finite body that floats free in space
anaximanders realization that the earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking
karl popper calls this idea one of the boldest most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking
such a model allowed the concept that celestial bodies could pass under the earth opening the way to greek astronomy
rovelli suggests that seeing the stars circling the pole star and both vanishing below the horizon on one side and reappearing above it on the other would suggest to the astronomer that there was a void both above and below the earth
anaximanders bold use of non mythological explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as hesiod
it indicates a pre socratic effort to demystify physical processes
his major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the universe and the origins of life for this he is often called the father of cosmology and founder of astronomy
however pseudo plutarch states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities
he placed the celestial bodies in the wrong order
he thought that the stars were nearest to the earth then the moon and the sun farthest away
his scheme is compatible with the indo iranian philosophical traditions contained in the iranian avesta and the indian upanishads
at the origin after the separation of hot and cold a ball of flame appeared that surrounded earth like bark on a tree
this ball broke apart to form the rest of the universe
it resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels filled with fire with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute
consequently the sun was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the earth on the farthest wheel and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole
the diameter of the solar wheel was twenty seven times that of the earth and the lunar wheel whose fire was less intense eighteen times
its hole could change shape thus explaining lunar phases
the stars and the planets located closer followed the same model
anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the sun as a huge mass and consequently to realize how far from earth it might be and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances
furthermore according to diogenes laertius he built a celestial sphere
this invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the zodiac as the roman philosopher pliny the elder reports in natural history
it is a little early to use the term ecliptic but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the earth to explain the seasons
the doxographer and theologian aetius attributes to pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity
according to simplicius anaximander already speculated on the plurality of worlds similar to atomists leucippus and democritus and later philosopher epicurus
these thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while and that some were born when others perished
they claimed that this movement was eternal for without movement there can be no generation no destruction
in addition to simplicius hippolytus reports anaximanders claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds
cicero writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds
this theory places anaximander close to the atomists and the epicureans who more than a century later also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared
in the timeline of the greek history of thought some thinkers conceptualized a single world while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds continuous or non continuous
anaximander attributed some phenomena such as thunder and lightning to the intervention of elements rather than to divine causes
in his system thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock
thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame but strong enough to produce a sound
a flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls allowing a less active fire to break free
thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow
he saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded earth
a part of that mass evaporated under the suns action thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant
he explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from earth by the sun
for him the earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions which someday would go dry as well
according to aristotles meteorology democritus also shared this opinion
anaximander speculated about the beginnings and origin of animal life and that humans came from other animals in waters
according to his evolutionary theory animals sprang out of the sea long ago born trapped in a spiny bark but as they got older the bark would dry up and animals would be able to break it
the rd century roman writer censorinus reports anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the earths climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales
he thought that considering humans extended infancy we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently
both strabo and agathemerus claim that according to the geographer eratosthenes anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world
the map probably inspired the greek historian hecataeus of miletus to draw a more accurate version
strabo viewed both as the first geographers after homer
maps were produced in ancient times also notably in egypt lydia the middle east and babylon
only some small examples survived until today
the unique example of a world map comes from the late babylonian map of the world later than th century bc but is based probably on a much older map
these maps indicated directions roads towns borders and geological features
anaximanders innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient greeks
such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears
anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons
first it could be used to improve navigation and trade between miletuss colonies and other colonies around the mediterranean sea and black sea
second thales would probably have found it easier to convince the ionian city states to join in a federation in order to push the median threat away if he possessed such a tool
finally the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one
surely aware of the seas convexity he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface
the centre or navel of the world could have been delphi but is more likely in anaximanders time to have been located near miletus
the aegean sea was near the maps centre and enclosed by three continents themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers
europe was bordered on the south by the mediterranean sea and was separated from asia by the black sea the lake maeotis and further east either by the phasis river or the tanais
the nile flowed south into the ocean separating libya from asia
the suda relates that anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry
it also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in greece of the gnomon
in lacedaemon he participated in the construction or at least in the adjustment of sundials to indicate solstices and equinoxes
indeed a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude
in his time the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane
the position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day
as it moves through its apparent course the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow which is shortest at noon when pointing due south
the variation in the tips position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice
the invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to anaximander because its use as well as the division of days into twelve parts came from the babylonians
it is they according to herodotus histories who gave the greeks the art of time measurement
it is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices because no calculation is necessary
on the other hand equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices as the babylonians thought
as the suda seems to suggest it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry he became the first greek to determine accurately the equinoxes
in his philosophical work de divinatione cicero states that anaximander convinced the inhabitants of lacedaemon to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near
the city collapsed when the top of the taygetus split like the stern of a ship
pliny the elder also mentions this anecdote suggesting that it came from an admirable inspiration as opposed to cicero who did not associate the prediction with divination
rovelli credits anaximander with pioneering the first great scientific revolution in history by introducing the naturalistic approach to understanding the universe according to which the universe operates by inviolable laws without recourse to supernatural explanations
according to rovelli anaximander not only paved the way for modern science but revolutionized the process for how we form our worldview by constantly questioning and rejecting certainty
rovelli further states that anaximander has not been given his due credit largely because his naturalistic approach was strongly opposed in antiquity and had yet to yield the tangible benefits it has today
bertrand russell in the history of western philosophy interprets anaximanders theories as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth fire and water all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others
anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance among these elements that where there was fire ashes now exist
his greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate
friedrich nietzsche in philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks claimed that anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness
in accordance with this anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness
in other words anaximander viewed
all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance
the world of individual objects in this way of thinking has no worth and should perish
martin heidegger lectured extensively on anaximander and delivered a lecture entitled anaximanders saying which was subsequently included in off the beaten track
the lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of being or dasein in the context of the anaximander fragment
heideggers lecture is in turn an important influence on the french philosopher jacques derrida
in the essay collection anaximander in context new studies on the origins of greek philosophy dirk couprie robert hahn and gerald naddaf describe anaximander as one of the greatest minds in history but one that has not been given his due
couprie goes to state that he considers him on par with newton
similar sentiments are expressed in carlo rovellis book the first scientist anaximander and his legacy
the anaximander high school of thessaloniki greece is named after anaximander
an architect is a person who plans designs and oversees the construction of buildings
to practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose
etymologically the term architect derives from the latin which derives from the greek ie chief builder
the professional requirements for architects vary from location to location
an architects decisions affect public safety and thus the architect must undergo specialised training consisting of advanced education and a practicum for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture
practical technical and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession
throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans such as stone masons and carpenters who rose to the role of master builders
until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and engineer
in europe the titles architect and engineer were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person often used interchangeably
architect derives from greek
in most developed countries only those qualified with an appropriate license certification or registration with a relevant body may legally practice architecture
such licensure usually requires a university degree successful completion of exams and a training period
representation of oneself as an architect through the use of terms and titles were restricted to licensed individuals by law although in general derivatives such as architectural designer were not legally protected
to practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision
the term building design professional by contrast is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession such as engineering professionals or those who assist in the practice of architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect such as intern architects
in many places independent non licensed individuals may perform design services outside of professional restrictions such as the design of houses or other smaller structures
in the architectural profession technical and environmental knowledge design and construction management require an understanding of business as well as design
however design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond
an architect accepts a commission from a client
the commission might involve preparing feasibility reports building audits and designing a building or several buildings structures and the spaces among them
the architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building
throughout the project the architect coordinates a design team
structural mechanical and electrical engineers are hired by the client or architect who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design
the architect once hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use
the architect must meet with and ask questions to the client in order to ascertain all the requirements of the planned project
often the full brief is not clear in the beginning
it involves a degree of risk in the design undertaking
the architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief
the program is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner
this becomes a guide for the architect in creating the design concept
design proposal are generally expected to be both imaginative and pragmatic
much depends upon the time place finance culture and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place
the extent and nature of these expectations will vary
foresight is a prerequisite when designing buildings as it is a very complex and demanding undertaking
any design concept during the early stage of its generation must take into account a great number of issues and variables including the qualities of the space the end use and life cycle of these proposed spaces connections relations and aspects between spaces including how they are put together and the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality
the selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks which could occur later in the project
the site and its surrounding environment as well as the culture and history of the place will also influence the design
the design must also balance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability
the architect may introduce aspects of mathematics and architecture new or current architectural theory or references to architectural history
a key part of the design is that the architect often must consult with engineers surveyors and other specialists throughout the design ensuring that aspects such as structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated
the control and planning of construction costs are also part of these consultations
coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication including advanced computer technology such as building information modeling computer aided design and cloud based technologies
finally at all times the architect must report back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations which might introduce further variables into the design
architects also deal with local and federal jurisdictions regarding regulations and building codes
the architect might need to comply with local planning and zoning laws such as required setbacks height limitations parking requirements transparency requirements and land use
some jurisdictions require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines
health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design and in some jurisdictions design reports and records are required to include ongoing considerations of materials and contaminants waste management and recycling traffic control and fire safety
previously architects employed drawings to illustrate and generate design proposals
while conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects computer technology has now become the industry standard
furthermore design may include the use of photos collages prints linocuts d scanning technology and other media in design production
increasingly computer software is shaping how architects work
bim technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life cycle of the buildings design construction and maintenance
virtual reality presentations are becoming more common for visualizing structural designs and interior spaces from the point of view perspective
since modern buildings are known to release carbon into the atmosphere increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions increase energy efficiency and make use of renewable energy sources
renewable energy sources may be designed into the proposed building by local or national renewable energy providers
as a result the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations that are continually being updated
some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use or passive solar building design
however the architect is also increasingly being required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense
examples of this include making provisions for low energy transport natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting natural ventilation instead of air conditioning pollution and waste management use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled
as the design becomes more advanced and detailed specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building
techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances
depending on the clients needs and the jurisdictions requirements the spectrum of the architects services during each construction stage may be extensive or less involved
architects typically put projects to tender on behalf of their clients advise them on the award of the project to a general contractor facilitate and administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor
this contract is legally binding and covers a wide range of aspects including the insurance and commitments of all stakeholders the status of the design documents provisions for the architects access and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed
depending on the type of contract utilised provisions for further sub contract tenders may be required
the architect may require that some elements be covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material product or work
in most jurisdictions prior notification to the relevant authority must be given before commencement of the project giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections
the architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority
the architect will typically review contractor shop drawings and other submittals prepare and issue site instructions and provide certificates for payment to the contractor which is based on the work done as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired in the future
in the united kingdom and other countries a quantity surveyor is often part of the team to provide cost consulting
with large complex projects an independent construction manager is sometimes hired to assist in the design and management of the construction
in many jurisdictions mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of the work is required
this demand for certification entails a high degree of risk therefore regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that the design is in compliance itself as well as following all relevant statutes and permissions
recent decades have seen the rise of specialisations within the profession
many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types technological expertise or project delivery methods
some architects specialise in building code building envelope sustainable design technical writing historic preservation or conservation and accessibility
many architects elect to move into real estate development corporate facilities planning project management construction management chief sustainability officers interior design city planning user experience design and design research
professional requirements although there are variations in each location most of the worlds architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction
architects are typically required to meet three common requirements education experience and examination
basic educational requirement generally consist of a university degree in architecture
the experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship
finally a registration examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure
professionals who engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting
instead they often trained under established architects
prior to modern times there was no distinction between architects and engineers and the title used varied depending on geographical location
they often carried the title of master builder or surveyor after serving a number of years as an apprentice
the formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory
the use of architect or abbreviations such as ar
as a title attached to a persons name was regulated by law in some countries
architects fee structure was typically based on a percentage of construction value as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee
combination of these structures were also common
fixed fees were usually based on a projects allocated construction cost and could range between and of new construction cost for commercial and institutional projects depending on the projects size and complexity
residential projects ranged from to
renovation projects typically commanded higher percentages such as
overall billings for architectural firms range widely depending on their location and economic climate
billings have traditionally been dependent on local economic conditions but with rapid globalization this is becoming less of a factor for large international firms
salaries could also vary depending on experience position within the firm and the size and location of the firm
a number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture
a wide variety of prizes is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies recognizing accomplished architects their buildings structures and professional careers
the most lucrative award an architect can receive is the pritzker prize sometimes termed the nobel prize for architecture
the inaugural pritzker prize winner was philip johnson who was cited as having years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums theatres libraries houses gardens and corporate structures
the pritzker prize has been awarded for forty two straight editions without interruption and there are now countries with at least one winning architect
other prestigious architectural awards are the royal gold medal the aia gold medal aia gold medal and the praemium imperiale
architects in the uk who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession might until be elected fellows of the royal institute of british architects and can write friba after their name if they feel so inclined
those elected to chartered membership of the riba after may use the initials riba but cannot use the old ariba and friba
an honorary fellow may use the initials hon
friba and an international fellow may use the initials int
architects in the us who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession are elected fellows of the american institute of architects and can write faia after their name
architects in canada who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contributions to research scholarship public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in canada or elsewhere may be recognized as fellows of the royal architectural institute of canada and can write fraic after their name
in hong kong those elected to chartered membership may use the initial hkia and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by the hong kong institute of architects may be elected as fellow members of hkia and may use fhkia after their name
an abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase by any method including shortening contraction initialism or crasis
an abbreviation may be a shortened form of a word with a trailing period
for example etcetera is usually abbreviated etc
and abbreviation is sometimes abbreviated abbr
or abbrev
but sometimes the trailing period is not used for such shortened forms
a contraction is an abbreviation formed by replacing letters with an apostrophe
examples include im for i am and lil for little
an initialism is an abbreviation consisting of the initial letter of a sequence of words without other punctuation
for example fbi usa ibm bbc
when an initialism is pronounced as a word rather than as separate letters it is an acronym examples include swat and nasa
initialisms contractions and crasis share some semantic and phonetic functions and are connected by the term abbreviation in loose parlance
in early times abbreviations may have been common due to the effort involved in writing or to provide secrecy via obfuscation
reduction of a word to a single letter was common in both greek and roman writing
in roman inscriptions words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation
however some could have more than one meaning depending on their context
many frequent abbreviations consisted of more than one letter for example cos for consul and coss for its nominative etc
plural consules
abbreviations were frequently used in early english
manuscripts of copies of the old english poem beowulf used many abbreviations for example the tironian et or for and and for since so that not much space is wasted
the standardisation of english in the th through th centuries included a growth in the use of such abbreviations
at first abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs not only periods
for example sequences like were replaced with as in for master and for exacerbate
while this may seem trivial it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time
in the early modern english period between the th and th centuries the thorn was used for th as in
in modern times was often used for promotional reasons as in
during the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic britain abbreviating became very fashionable
likewise a century earlier in boston a fad of abbreviation started that swept the united states with the globally popular term ok generally credited as a remnant of its influence
over the years however the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not
this question is considered below
widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the internet during the s led to a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation
this was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant and text messaging
the original sms supported message lengths of characters at most for instance
this brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called textese with which or more of the words in a typical sms message are abbreviated
more recently twitter a popular social networking service began driving abbreviation use with character message limits
in html abbreviations can be annotated using abbreviation to reveal its meaning by hovering the cursor
in modern english there are multiple conventions for abbreviation and there is controversy as to which should be used
one generally accepted rule is to be consistent in a body of work
to this end publishers may express their preferences in a style guide
some controversies that arise are described below
if the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital for example lev
for leviticus
when a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization
however when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken then all letters should be capitalized as in ytd for year to date pcb for printed circuit board and fyi for for your information
however see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary these are no longer written with capital letters
a period is sometimes used to signify abbreviation but opinion is divided as to when and if this convention is best practice
according to harts rules a word shortened by dropping letters from the end terminates with a period whereas a word shorted by dropping letters from the middle does not
fowlers modern english usage says a period is used for both of these shortened forms but recommends against this practice advising it only for end shortened words and lower case initialisms not for middle shortened words and upper case initialisms
some british style guides such as for the guardian and the economist disallow periods for all abbreviations
in american english the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction eg dr or mrs
in some cases periods are optional as in either us or us for united states eu or eu for european union and un or un for united nations
there are some house styles however american ones included that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations
for example acronyms that were originally capitalized but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods
examples are sonar radar lidar laser snafu and scuba
when an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence only one period is used the capital of the united states is washington dc
in the past some initialisms were styled with a period after each letter and a space between each pair
for example u
but today this is typically us
there are multiple ways to pluralize an abbreviation
sometimes this accomplished by adding an apostrophe and an s as in two pcs have broken screens
but some find this confusing since the notation can indicate possessive case
and this style is deprecated by many style guides
for instance kate turabian writing about style in academic writings allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters
for example dvds and urls and phds while the modern language association explicitly says do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation
also the american psychological association specifically says without an apostrophe
however the style guide for the new york times states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations preferring pcs tvs and vcrs
forming a plural of an initialization without an apostrophe can also be used for a number or a letter
examples when an abbreviation contains more than one period harts rules recommends putting the s after the final one
examples according to harts rules an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects
in latin and continuing to the derivative forms in european languages as well as english single letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note taking
most of these deal with writing and publishing
a few longer abbreviations use this as well
publications based in the us tend to follow the style guides of the chicago manual of style and the associated press
the us government follows a style guide published by the us government printing office
the national institute of standards and technology sets the style for abbreviations of units
writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure
such shorthand can be an abbreviation such as in for inch or can be a symbol such as km for kilometre
in the international system of units manual the word symbol is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various si units of measure
the manual also defines the way in which units should be written the principal rules being a syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words such as interpol international police
it is a variant of the acronym
syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case sometimes starting with a capital letter and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter
syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each
in albanian syllabic acronyms are sometimes used for composing a persons name such as migjeni an abbreviation from his original name a famous albanian poet and writer or asdreni another famous albanian poet
other such names which are used commonly in recent decades are getoar composed from gegeria tosks and arbanon which is an alternative way used to describe all albanian lands
syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in english
some uk government agencies such as ofcom and the former oftel use this style
new york city has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation such as tribeca and soho
this usage has spread into other american cities giving soma san francisco and lodo denver amongst others
chicago based electric service provider comed is a syllabic abbreviation of commonwealth and edison
sections of california are also often colloquially syllabically abbreviated as in norcal cencal and socal
additionally in the context of los angeles the syllabic abbreviation soho refers to the southern portion of the hollywood neighborhood
partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the us navy as they increase readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms
hence desron is used to mean destroyer squadron while comnavairlant would be commander naval air force atlantic
syllabic abbreviations are a prominent feature of newspeak the fictional language of george orwells dystopian novel nineteen eighty four
the political contractions of newspeak ingsoc minitrue miniplenty are described by orwell as similar to real examples of german and russian contractions in the th century
like nazi and gestapo politburo comintern kolkhoz and komsomol the contractions in newspeak are supposed to have a political function by virtue of their abbreviated structure itself nice sounding and easily pronounceable their purpose is to mask all ideological content from the speaker
a more recent syllabic abbreviation has emerged with the disease covid caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
syllabic abbreviations were and are common in german much like acronyms in english they have a distinctly modern connotation although contrary to popular belief many date back to before if not the end of the great war
literally criminal police but idiomatically the criminal investigation department of any german police force begat and likewise begat
along the same lines the swiss federal railways transit police the are abbreviated as the
with the national socialist german workers party gaining power came a frenzy of government reorganisation and with it a series of entirely new syllabic abbreviations
the single national police force amalgamated from the of the various states became the orpo the state kripos together formed the sipo and there was also the gestapo
the new order of the german democratic republic in the east brought about a conscious denazification but also a repudiation of earlier turns of phrase in favour of neologisms such as for and for
the phrase which may be rendered literally as office of politics or idiomatically as political party steering committee became
syllabic abbreviations are not only used in politics however
many business names trademarks and service marks from across germany are created on the same pattern for a few examples there is aldi from theo albrecht the name of its founder followed by discount haribo from hans riegel the name of its founder followed by bonn the town of its head office and adidas from adolf adi dassler the nickname of its founder followed by his surname
syllabic abbreviations are very common in russian belarusian and ukrainian languages
they are often used as names of organizations
historically popularization of abbreviations was a way to simplify mass education in s
leninist organisations such as the comintern and komsomol used russian language syllabic abbreviations
in the modern russian language words like rosselkhozbank and minobrnauki are still commonly used
in nearby belarus there are beltelecom and belsat
syllabic abbreviations are common in spanish examples abound in organization names such as pemex for petrleos mexicanos or fonafifo for fondo nacional de financimiento forestal
in southeast asian languages especially in malay languages abbreviations are common examples include petronas its indonesian equivalent pertamina and kemenhub
malaysian abbreviation often uses letters from each word while indonesia usually uses syllables although some cases do not follow the style
for example general elections in malaysian malay often shortened into pru while indonesian often shortened into pemilu
another example is ministry of health in which malaysian malay uses kkm compared to indonesian kemenkes
east asian languages whose writing systems use chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key chinese characters from a term or phrase
for example in japanese the term for the united nations kokusai reng is often abbreviated to kokuren
in japanese see also japanese abbreviated and contracted words
the syllabic abbreviation of kanji words is frequently used for universities for instance tdai for tky daigaku and is used similarly in chinese bid for bijng dxu
korean universities often follow the same conventions such as hongdae as short for hongik daehakgyo or hongik university
the english phrase gung ho originated as a chinese abbreviation
aphrodite is an ancient greek goddess associated with love lust beauty pleasure passion procreation and as her syncretized roman goddess counterpart desire sex fertility prosperity and victory
aphrodites major symbols include seashells myrtles roses doves sparrows and swans
the cult of aphrodite was largely derived from that of the phoenician goddess astarte a cognate of the east semitic goddess ishtar whose cult was based on the sumerian cult of inanna
aphrodites main cult centers were cythera cyprus corinth and athens
her main festival was the aphrodisia which was celebrated annually in midsummer
in laconia aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess
she was also the patron goddess of prostitutes an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of sacred prostitution in greco roman culture an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous
in hesiods theogony aphrodite is born off the coast of cythera from the foam produced by uranuss genitals which his son cronus had severed and thrown into the sea
in homers iliad however she is the daughter of zeus and dione
plato in his symposium asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities aphrodite urania and aphrodite pandemos
aphrodite had many other epithets each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess or used by a different local cult
thus she was also known as cytherea and cypris because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth
in greek mythology aphrodite was married to hephaestus the god of fire blacksmiths and metalworking
aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers in the odyssey she is caught in the act of adultery with ares the god of war
in the first homeric hymn to aphrodite she seduces the mortal shepherd anchises
aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd adonis who was killed by a wild boar
along with athena and hera aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the trojan war and she plays a major role throughout the iliad
aphrodite has been featured in western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of western literature
she is a major deity in modern neopagan religions including the church of aphrodite wicca and hellenismos
hesiod derives aphrodite from sea foam interpreting the name as risen from the foam but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious folk etymology
early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that aphrodites name was of greek or indo european origin but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned
aphrodites name is generally accepted to be of non greek origin but its exact derivation cannot be determined
scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries accepting hesiods foam etymology as genuine analyzed the second part of aphrodites name as odt wanderer or dt bright
more recently michael janda also accepting hesiods etymology has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an indo european mytheme
similarly krzysztof tomasz witczak proposes an indo european compound very and to shine also referring to eos and daniel klligan has interpreted her name as shining up from the mist foam
other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since aphrodites attributes are entirely different from those of both eos and the vedic deity ushas
a number of improbable non greek etymologies have also been suggested
one semitic etymology compares aphrodite to the assyrian barrtu the name of a female demon that appears in middle babylonian and late babylonian texts
hammarstrm looks to etruscan comparing prni lord an etruscan honorific loaned into greek as
this would make the theonym in origin an honorific the lady
most scholars reject this etymology as implausible especially since aphrodite actually appears in etruscan in the borrowed form apru
the medieval etymologicum magnum offers a highly contrived etymology deriving aphrodite from the compound habrodaitos she who lives delicately from habrs and daita
the alteration from b to ph is explained as a familiar characteristic of greek obvious from the macedonians
in the cypriot syllabary a syllabic script used on the island of cyprus from the eleventh until the fourth century bc her name is attested in the forms and finally
the cult of aphrodite in greece was imported from or at least influenced by the cult of astarte in phoenicia which in turn was influenced by the cult of the mesopotamian goddess known as ishtar to the east semitic peoples and as inanna to the sumerians
pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of aphrodite were the assyrians followed by the paphians of cyprus and then the phoenicians at ascalon
the phoenicians in turn taught her worship to the people of cythera
aphrodite took on inanna ishtars associations with sexuality and procreation
furthermore she was known as ourania which means heavenly a title corresponding to inannas role as the queen of heaven
early artistic and literary portrayals of aphrodite are extremely similar on inanna ishtar
like inanna ishtar aphrodite was also a warrior goddess the second century ad greek geographer pausanias records that in sparta aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia which means warlike
he also mentions that aphrodites most ancient cult statues in sparta and on cythera showed her bearing arms
modern scholars note that aphrodites warrior goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her near eastern origins
nineteenth century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the near east but even friedrich gottlieb welcker who argued that near eastern influence on greek culture was largely confined to material culture admitted that aphrodite was clearly of phoenician origin
the significant influence of near eastern culture on early greek religion in general and on the cult of aphrodite in particular is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century bc when archaic greece was on the fringes of the neo assyrian empire
some early comparative mythologists opposed to the idea of a near eastern origin argued that aphrodite originated as an aspect of the greek dawn goddess eos and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the proto indo european dawn goddess hauss
most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely indo european aphrodite but it is possible that aphrodite originally a semitic deity may have been influenced by the indo european dawn goddess
both aphrodite and eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality and both had relationships with mortal lovers
both goddesses were associated with the colors red white and gold
michael janda etymologizes aphrodites name as an epithet of eos meaning she who rises from the foam the ocean and points to hesiods theogony account of aphrodites birth as an archaic reflex of indo european myth
aphrodite rising out of the waters after cronus defeats uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the rigvedic myth of indra defeating vrtra liberating ushas
another key similarity between aphrodite and the indo european dawn goddess is her close kinship to the greek sky deity since both of the main claimants to her paternity are sky deities
aphrodites most common cultic epithet was ourania meaning heavenly but this epithet almost never occurs in literary texts indicating a purely cultic significance
another common name for aphrodite was pandemos
in her role as aphrodite pandemos aphrodite was associated with peith meaning persuasion and could be prayed to for aid in seduction
the character of pausanias in platos symposium takes differing cult practices associated with different epithets of the goddess to claim that ourania and pandemos are in fact separate goddesses
he asserts that aphrodite ourania is the celestial aphrodite born from the sea foam after cronus castrated uranus and the older of the two goddesses
according to the symposium aphrodite ourania is the inspiration of male homosexual desire specifically the ephebic eros and pederasty
aphrodite pandemos by contrast is the younger of the two goddesses the common aphrodite born from the union of zeus and dione and the inspiration of heterosexual desire and sexual promiscuity the lesser of the two loves
paphian was one of her epithets after the paphos in cyprus where she had emerged from the sea at her birth
among the neoplatonists and later their christian interpreters ourania is associated with spiritual love and pandemos with physical love
a representation of ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love it was the subject of a chryselephantine sculpture by phidias for elis known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer pausanias
one of aphrodites most common literary epithets is philommeids which means smile loving but is sometimes mistranslated as laughter loving
this epithet occurs throughout both of the homeric epics and the first homeric hymn to aphrodite
hesiod references it once in his theogony in the context of aphrodites birth but interprets it as genital loving rather than smile loving
monica cyrino notes that the epithet may relate to the fact that in many artistic depictions of aphrodite she is shown smiling
other common literary epithets are cypris and cythereia which derive from her associations with the islands of cyprus and cythera respectively
on cyprus aphrodite was sometimes called eleemon
in athens she was known as aphrodite en kopois
at cape colias a town along the attic coast she was venerated as genetyllis mother
the spartans worshipped her as potnia mistress enoplios armed morpho shapely ambologera she who postpones old age
across the greek world she was known under epithets such as melainis black one skotia dark one androphonos killer of men anosia unholy and tymborychos gravedigger all of which indicate her darker more violent nature
she had the epithet automata because according to servius she was the source of spontaneous love
a male version of aphrodite known as aphroditus was worshipped in the city of amathus on cyprus
aphroditus was depicted with the figure and dress of a woman but had a beard and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect phallus
this gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer
eventually the popularity of aphroditus waned as the mainstream fully feminine version of aphrodite became more popular but traces of his cult are preserved in the later legends of hermaphroditus
aphrodites main festival the aphrodisia was celebrated across greece but particularly in athens and corinth
in athens the aphrodisia was celebrated on the fourth day of the month of hekatombaion in honor of aphrodites role in the unification of attica
during this festival the priests of aphrodite would purify the temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwestern slope of the acropolis with the blood of a sacrificed dove
next the altars would be anointed and the cult statues of aphrodite pandemos and peitho would be escorted in a majestic procession to a place where they would be ritually bathed
aphrodite was also honored in athens as part of the arrhephoria festival
the fourth day of every month was sacred to aphrodite
pausanias records that in sparta aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia which means warlike
this epithet stresses aphrodites connections to ares with whom she had extramarital relations
pausanias also records that in sparta and on cythera a number of extremely ancient cult statues of aphrodite portrayed her bearing arms
other cult statues showed her bound in chains
aphrodite was the patron goddess of prostitutes of all varieties ranging from pornai to hetairai
the city of corinth was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many hetairai who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled but also the most expensive prostitutes in the greek world
corinth also had a major temple to aphrodite located on the acrocorinth and was one of the main centers of her cult
records of numerous dedications to aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions
references to aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in corinth as well as on the islands of cyprus cythera and sicily
aphrodites mesopotamian precursor inanna ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution
scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries believed that the cult of aphrodite may have involved ritual prostitution an assumption based on ambiguous passages in certain ancient texts particularly a fragment of a skolion by the boeotian poet pindar which mentions prostitutes in corinth in association with aphrodite
modern scholars now dismiss the notion of ritual prostitution in greece as a historiographic myth with no factual basis
during the hellenistic period the greeks identified aphrodite with the ancient egyptian goddesses hathor and isis
aphrodite was the patron goddess of the lagid queens and queen arsinoe ii was identified as her mortal incarnation
aphrodite was worshipped in alexandria and had numerous temples in and around the city
arsinoe ii introduced the cult of adonis to alexandria and many of the women there partook in it
the tessarakonteres a gigantic catamaran galley designed by archimedes for ptolemy iv philopator had a circular temple to aphrodite on it with a marble statue of the goddess herself
in the second century bc ptolemy viii physcon and his wives cleopatra ii and cleopatra iii dedicated a temple to aphrodite hathor at philae
statuettes of aphrodite for personal devotion became common in egypt starting in the early ptolemaic times and extending until long after egypt became a roman province
the ancient romans identified aphrodite with their goddess venus who was originally a goddess of agricultural fertility vegetation and springtime
according to the roman historian livy aphrodite and venus were officially identified in the third century bc when the cult of venus erycina was introduced to rome from the greek sanctuary of aphrodite on mount eryx in sicily
after this point romans adopted aphrodites iconography and myths and applied them to venus
because aphrodite was the mother of the trojan hero aeneas in greek mythology and roman tradition claimed aeneas as the founder of rome venus became venerated as venus genetrix the mother of the entire roman nation
julius caesar claimed to be directly descended from aeneass son iulus and became a strong proponent of the cult of venus
this precedent was later followed by his nephew augustus and the later emperors claiming succession from him
this syncretism greatly impacted greek worship of aphrodite
during the roman era the cults of aphrodite in many greek cities began to emphasize her relationship with troy and aeneas
they also began to adopt distinctively roman elements portraying aphrodite as more maternal more militaristic and more concerned with administrative bureaucracy
she was claimed as a divine guardian by many political magistrates
appearances of aphrodite in greek literature also vastly proliferated usually showing aphrodite in a characteristically roman manner
aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship paphos on the island of cyprus which is why she is sometimes called cyprian especially in the poetic works of sappho
the sanctuary of aphrodite paphia marking her birthplace was a place of pilgrimage in the ancient world for centuries
other versions of her myth have her born near the island of cythera hence another of her names cytherea
cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between crete and the peloponesus so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of aphrodites cult from the middle east to mainland greece
according to the version of her birth recounted by hesiod in his theogony cronus severed uranus genitals and threw them behind him into the sea
the foam from his genitals gave rise to aphrodite while the giants the erinyes and the meliae emerged from the drops of his blood
hesiod states that the genitals were carried over the sea a long time and white foam arose from the immortal flesh with it a girl grew
after aphrodite was born from the sea foam she washed up to shore in the presence of the other gods
hesiods account of aphrodites birth following uranuss castration is probably derived from the song of kumarbi an ancient hittite epic poem in which the god kumarbi overthrows his father anu the god of the sky and bites off his genitals causing him to become pregnant and give birth to anus children which include ishtar and her brother teshub the hittite storm god
in the iliad aphrodite is described as the daughter of zeus and dione
diones name appears to be a feminine cognate to dios and dion which are oblique forms of the name zeus
zeus and dione shared a cult at dodona in northwestern greece
in the theogony hesiod describes dione as an oceanid but apollodorus makes her the thirteenth titan child of gaia and uranus
aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile infinitely desirable adult having had no childhood
she is often depicted nude
in the iliad aphrodite is the apparently unmarried consort of ares the god of war and the wife of hephaestus is a different goddess named charis
likewise in hesiods theogony aphrodite is unmarried and the wife of hephaestus is aglaea the youngest of the three charites
in book eight of the odyssey however the blind singer demodocus describes aphrodite as the wife of hephaestus and tells how she committed adultery with ares during the trojan war
the sun god helios saw aphrodite and ares having sex in hephaestuss bed and warned hephaestus who fashioned a fine near invisible net
the next time ares and aphrodite had sex together the net trapped them both
hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers but apollo hermes and poseidon had sympathy for ares and poseidon agreed to pay hephaestus for aress release
aphrodite returned to her temple in cyprus where she was attended by the charites
this narrative probably originated as a greek folk tale originally independent of the odyssey
in a much later interpolated detail ares put the young soldier alectryon by the door to warn of helioss arrival but alectryon fell asleep on guard duty
helios discovered the two and alerted hephaestus ares in rage turned alectryon into a rooster which unfailingly crows to announce the sunrise
after exposing them hephaestus asks zeus for his wedding gifts and dowry to be returned to him by the time of the trojan war he is married to charis aglaea one of the graces apparently divorced from aphrodite
afterwards it was generally ares who was regarded as the husband or official consort of the goddess on the franois vase the two arrive at the wedding of peleus and thetis on the same chariot as do zeus with hera and poseidon with amphitrite
the poets pindar and aeschylus refer to ares as aphrodites husband
later stories were invented to explain aphrodites marriage to hephaestus
in the most famous story zeus hastily married aphrodite to hephaestus in order to prevent the other gods from fighting over her
in another version of the myth hephaestus gave his mother hera a golden throne but when she sat on it she became trapped and he refused to let her go until she agreed to give him aphrodites hand in marriage
hephaestus was overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry including a strophion known as the a saltire shaped undergarment which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men
such strophia were commonly used in depictions of the near eastern goddesses ishtar and atargatis
aphrodite is almost always accompanied by eros the god of lust and sexual desire
in his theogony hesiod describes eros as one of the four original primeval forces born at the beginning of time but after the birth of aphrodite from the sea foam he is joined by himeros and together they become aphrodites constant companions
in early greek art eros and himeros are both shown as idealized handsome youths with wings
the greek lyric poets regarded the power of eros and himeros as dangerous compulsive and impossible for anyone to resist
in modern times eros is often seen as aphrodites son but this is actually a comparatively late innovation
a scholion on theocrituss idylls remarks that the sixth century bc poet sappho had described eros as the son of aphrodite and uranus but the first surviving reference to eros as aphrodites son comes from apollonius of rhodess argonautica written in the third century bc which makes him the son of aphrodite and ares
later the romans who saw venus as a mother goddess seized on this idea of eros as aphrodites son and popularized it making it the predominant portrayal in works on mythology until the present day
aphrodites main attendants were the three charites whom hesiod identifies as the daughters of zeus and eurynome and names as aglaea euphrosyne and thalia
the charites had been worshipped as goddesses in greece since the beginning of greek history long before aphrodite was introduced to the pantheon
aphrodites other set of attendants was the three horae whom hesiod identifies as the daughters of zeus and themis and names as eunomia dike and eirene
aphrodite was also sometimes accompanied by harmonia her daughter by ares and hebe the daughter of zeus and hera
the fertility god priapus was usually considered to be aphrodites son by dionysus but he was sometimes also described as her son by hermes adonis or even zeus
a scholion on apollonius of rhodess argonautica states that while aphrodite was pregnant with priapus hera envied her and applied an evil potion to her belly while she was sleeping to ensure that the child would be hideous
in another version hera cursed aphrodites unborn son because he had been fathered by zeus
when aphrodite gave birth she was horrified to see that the child had a massive permanently erect penis a potbelly and a huge tongue
aphrodite abandoned the infant to die in the wilderness but a herdsman found him and raised him later discovering that priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants
the first homeric hymn to aphrodite which was probably composed sometime in the mid seventh century bc describes how zeus once became annoyed with aphrodite for causing deities to fall in love with mortals so he caused her to fall in love with anchises a handsome mortal shepherd who lived in the foothills beneath mount ida near the city of troy
aphrodite appears to anchises in the form of a tall beautiful mortal virgin while he is alone in his home
anchises sees her dressed in bright clothing and gleaming jewelry with her breasts shining with divine radiance
he asks her if she is aphrodite and promises to build her an altar on top of the mountain if she will bless him and his family
aphrodite lies and tells him that she is not a goddess but the daughter of one of the noble families of phrygia
she claims to be able to understand the trojan language because she had a trojan nurse as a child and says that she found herself on the mountainside after she was snatched up by hermes while dancing in a celebration in honor of artemis the goddess of virginity
aphrodite tells anchises that she is still a virgin and begs him to take her to his parents
anchises immediately becomes overcome with mad lust for aphrodite and swears that he will have sex with her
anchises takes aphrodite with her eyes cast downwards to his bed which is covered in the furs of lions and bears
he then strips her naked and makes love to her
after the lovemaking is complete aphrodite reveals her true divine form
anchises is terrified but aphrodite consoles him and promises that she will bear him a son
she prophesies that their son will be the demigod aeneas who will be raised by the nymphs of the wilderness for five years before going to troy to become a nobleman like his father
the story of aeneass conception is also mentioned in hesiods theogony and in book ii of homers iliad
the myth of aphrodite and adonis is probably derived from the ancient sumerian legend of inanna and dumuzid
the greek name is derived from the canaanite word adn meaning lord
the earliest known greek reference to adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the lesbian poet sappho in which a chorus of young girls asks aphrodite what they can do to mourn adoniss death
aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics
later references flesh out the story with more details
according to the retelling of the story found in the poem metamorphoses by the roman poet ovid adonis was the son of myrrha who was cursed by aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father king cinyras of cyprus after myrrhas mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess
driven out after becoming pregnant myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree but still gave birth to adonis
aphrodite found the baby and took him to the underworld to be fostered by persephone
she returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome
persephone wanted to keep adonis resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess adonis
zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that adonis would spend one third of the year with aphrodite one third with persephone and one third with whomever he chose
adonis chose to spend that time with aphrodite
then one day while adonis was hunting he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in aphrodites arms
in a semi mocking work the dialogues of the gods the satirical author lucian comedically relates how a frustrated aphrodite complains to the moon goddess selene about her son eros making persephone fall in love with adonis and now she has to share him with her
in different versions of the story the boar was either sent by ares who was jealous that aphrodite was spending so much time with adonis or by artemis who wanted revenge against aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower hippolytus
in another version apollo in fury changed himself into a boar and killed adonis because aphrodite had blinded his son erymanthus when he stumbled upon aphrodite naked as she was bathing after intercourse with adonis
the story also provides an etiology for aphrodites associations with certain flowers
reportedly as she mourned adoniss death she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death
in one version of the story aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose which had previously been white was stained red by her blood
according to lucians on the syrian goddess each year during the festival of adonis the adonis river in lebanon ran red with blood
the myth of adonis is associated with the festival of the adonia which was celebrated by greek women every year in midsummer
the festival which was evidently already celebrated in lesbos by sapphos time seems to have first become popular in athens in the mid fifth century bc
at the start of the festival the women would plant a garden of adonis a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick growing plants such as lettuce and fennel or even quick sprouting grains such as wheat and barley
the women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun
the plants would sprout in the sunlight but wither quickly in the heat
then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of adonis tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief
in hesiods works and days zeus orders aphrodite to make pandora the first woman physically beautiful and sexually attractive so that she may become an evil men will love to embrace
aphrodite spills grace over pandoras head and equips her with painful desire and knee weakening anguish thus making her the perfect vessel for evil to enter the world
aphrodites attendants peitho the charites and the horae adorn pandora with gold and jewelry
according to one myth aphrodite aided hippomenes a noble youth who wished to marry atalanta a maiden who was renowned throughout the land for her beauty but who refused to marry any man unless he could outrun her in a footrace
atalanta was an exceedingly swift runner and she beheaded all of the men who lost to her
aphrodite gave hippomenes three golden apples from the garden of the hesperides and instructed him to toss them in front of atalanta as he raced her
hippomenes obeyed aphrodites order and atalanta seeing the beautiful golden fruits bent down to pick up each one allowing hippomenes to outrun her
in the version of the story from ovids metamorphoses hippomenes forgets to repay aphrodite for her aid so she causes the couple to become inflamed with lust while they are staying at the temple of cybele
the couple desecrate the temple by having sex in it leading cybele to turn them into lions as punishment
the myth of pygmalion is first mentioned by the third century bc greek writer philostephanus of cyrene but is first recounted in detail in ovids metamorphoses
according to ovid pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of cyprus who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry
he fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of aphrodite and longed to marry it
because pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to aphrodite the goddess brought the statue to life
pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named paphos after whom the capital of cyprus received its name
pseudo apollodorus later mentions metharme daughter of pygmalion king of cyprus
aphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her but also punished those who disrespected her often quite brutally
a myth described in apollonius of rhodess argonautica and later summarized in the bibliotheca of pseudo apollodorus tells how when the women of the island of lemnos refused to sacrifice to aphrodite the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them
instead their husbands started having sex with their thracian slave girls
in anger the women of lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island as well as all the thracian slaves
when jason and his crew of argonauts arrived on lemnos they mated with the sex starved women under aphrodites approval and repopulated the island
from then on the women of lemnos never disrespected aphrodite again
in euripidess tragedy hippolytus which was first performed at the city dionysia in bc theseuss son hippolytus worships only artemis the goddess of virginity and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact
aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior and in the prologue to the play she declares that by honoring only artemis and refusing to venerate her hippolytus has directly challenged her authority
aphrodite therefore causes hippolytuss stepmother phaedra to fall in love with him knowing hippolytus will reject her
after being rejected phaedra commits suicide and leaves a suicide note to theseus telling him that she killed herself because hippolytus attempted to rape her
theseus prays to poseidon to kill hippolytus for his transgression
poseidon sends a wild bull to scare hippolytuss horses as he is riding by the sea in his chariot causing the horses to bolt and smash the chariot against the cliffs dragging hippolytus to a bloody death across the rocky shoreline
the play concludes with artemis vowing to kill aphrodites own mortal beloved in revenge
glaucus of corinth angered aphrodite by refusing to let his horses for chariot racing mate since doing so would hinder their speed
during the chariot race at the funeral games of king pelias aphrodite drove his horses mad and they tore him apart
polyphonte was a young woman who chose a virginal life with artemis instead of marriage and children as favoured by aphrodite
aphrodite cursed her causing her to have children by a bear
the resulting offspring agrius and oreius were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of zeus
ultimately he transformed all the members of the family into birds of ill omen
according to apollodorus a jealous aphrodite cursed eos the goddess of dawn to be perpetually in love and have insatiable sexual desire because eos once had lain with aphrodites sweetheart ares the god of war
according to ovid in his metamorphoses propoetides who are the daughters of propoetus from the city of amathus on the island of cyprus denied aphrodites divinity and failed to worship her properly
therefore aphrodite turned them into the worlds first prostitutes
according to diodorus siculus when the rhodian sea nymphe halias six sons by poseidon arrogantly refused to let aphrodite land upon their shore the goddess cursed them with insanity
in their madness they raped halia
as punishment poseidon buried them in the islands sea caverns
xanthius a descendant of bellerophon had two children leucippus and an unnamed daughter
through the wrath of aphrodite leucippus fell in love with his own sister
they started a secret relationship but the girl was already betrothed to another man and he went on to inform her father xanthius without telling him the name of the seducer
xanthius went straight to his daughters chamber where she was together with leucippus right at the moment
on hearing him enter she tried to escape but xanthius hit her with a dagger thinking that he was slaying the seducer and killed her
leucippus failing to recognize his father at first slew him
when the truth was revealed he had to leave the country and took part in colonization of crete and the lands in asia minor
queen cenchreis of cyprus wife of king cinyras bragged that her daughter myrrha was more beautiful than aphrodite
therefore myrrha was cursed by aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father king cinyras of cyprus and he slept with her unknowingly in the dark
she eventually transformed into the myrrh tree and gave birth to adonis in this form
cinyras also had three other daughters braesia laogora and orsedice
these girls by the wrath of aphrodite cohabited with foreigners and ended their life in egypt
the muse clio derided the goddess own love for adonis
therefore clio fell in love with pierus son of magnes and bore hyacinth
aegiale was a daughter of adrastus and amphithea and was married to diomedes
because of anger of aphrodite whom diomedes had wounded in the war against troy she had multiple lovers including a certain hippolytus
when aegiale went so far as to threaten his life he fled to italy
according to stesichorus and hesiod while tyndareus sacrificing to the gods he forgot aphrodite therefore the goddess made his daughters twice and thrice wed and deserters of their husbands
timandra deserted echemus and went and came to phyleus and clytaemnestra deserted agamemnon and lay with aegisthus who was a worse mate for her and eventually killed her husband with her lover and finally helen of troy deserted menelaus under the influence of aphrodite for paris and her unfaitfulness eventually causes the war of troy
as a result of her actions aphrodite caused the war of troy in order to take priams kingdom and pass it down to her descendants
in one of the versions of the legend pasiphae did not make offerings to the goddess venus because of this venus personally i just cant get turned on by a system that expects me to either be content with a simple subtraction of numbers to find out who won or to describe an entire combat blow by blow just so that i can attempt some trick to win

athene or athena is the shrewd companion of heroes and the goddess of heroic endeavour in greek mythology
an alloy is a mixture of chemical elements of which in most cases at least one is a metallic element although it is also sometimes used for mixtures of elements
most alloys are metallic and show good electrical conductivity ductility opacity and luster but may have properties that differ from those of the pure metals such as increased strength or hardness
in some cases an alloy may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties
in other cases the mixture imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength
in an alloy the atoms are joined by metallic bonding rather than by covalent bonds typically found in chemical compounds
the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications and in atomic fraction for basic science studies
alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy
they can be further classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous or intermetallic
an alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements are of the same composition or a mixture of metallic phases
examples of alloys include red gold white gold sterling silver steel or silicon steel solder brass pewter duralumin bronze and amalgams
alloys are used in a wide variety of applications from the steel alloys used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry to beryllium copper alloys for non sparking tools
an alloy is a mixture of chemical elements which forms an impure substance that retains the characteristics of a metal
an alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that with an alloy the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties while impure metals such as wrought iron are less controlled but are often considered useful
alloys are made by mixing two or more elements at least one of which is a metal
this is usually called the primary metal or the base metal and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy
the other constituents may or may not be metals but when mixed with the molten base they will be soluble and dissolve into the mixture
the mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents
a metal that is normally very soft such as aluminium can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal such as copper
although both metals are very soft and ductile the resulting aluminium alloy will have much greater strength
adding a small amount of non metallic carbon to iron trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called steel
due to its very high strength but still substantial toughness and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use
by adding chromium to steel its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced creating stainless steel while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics producing silicon steel
like oil and water a molten metal may not always mix with another element
for example pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper
even when the constituents are soluble each will usually have a saturation point beyond which no more of the constituent can be added
iron for example can hold a maximum of carbon
although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state they may not always be soluble in the solid state
if the metals remain soluble when solid the alloy forms a solid solution becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals called a phase
if as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases some with more of one constituent than the other
however in other alloys the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs
if cooled very quickly they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents
as time passes the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice becoming more stable and forming a second phase that serves to reinforce the crystals internally
some alloys such as electrum an alloy of silver and gold occur naturally
meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel but are not native to the earth
one of the first alloys made by humans was bronze which is a mixture of the metals tin and copper
bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components
steel was another common alloy
however in ancient times it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires during the manufacture of iron
other ancient alloys include pewter brass and pig iron
in the modern age steel can be created in many forms
carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel
alloy steels can be made by adding other elements such as chromium molybdenum vanadium or nickel resulting in alloys such as high speed steel or tool steel
small amounts of manganese are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities like phosphorus sulfur and oxygen which can have detrimental effects on the alloy
however most alloys were not created until the s such as various aluminium titanium nickel and magnesium alloys
some modern superalloys such as incoloy inconel and hastelloy may consist of a multitude of different elements
an alloy is technically an impure metal but when referring to alloys the term impurities usually denotes undesirable elements
such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements but are removed during processing
for instance sulfur is a common impurity in steel
sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide which is very brittle creating weak spots in the steel
lithium sodium and calcium are common impurities in aluminium alloys which can have adverse effects on the structural integrity of castings
conversely otherwise pure metals that contain unwanted impurities are often called impure metals and are not usually referred to as alloys
oxygen present in the air readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying
great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities using fluxes chemical additives or other methods of extractive metallurgy
alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements
the most common and oldest alloying process is performed by heating the base metal beyond its melting point and then dissolving the solutes into the molten liquid which may be possible even if the melting point of the solute is far greater than that of the base
for example in its liquid state titanium is a very strong solvent capable of dissolving most metals and elements
in addition it readily absorbs gases like oxygen and burns in the presence of nitrogen
this increases the chance of contamination from any contacting surface and so must be melted in vacuum induction heating and special water cooled copper crucibles
however some metals and solutes such as iron and carbon have very high melting points and were impossible for ancient people to melt
thus alloying may also be performed with one or more constituents in a gaseous state such as found in a blast furnace to make pig iron nitriding carbonitriding or other forms of case hardening or the cementation process used to make blister steel
it may also be done with one more or all of the constituents in the solid state such as found in ancient methods of pattern welding shear steel or crucible steel production mixing the elements via solid state diffusion
by adding another element to a metal differences in the size of the atoms create internal stresses in the lattice of the metallic crystals stresses that often enhance its properties
for example the combination of carbon with iron produces steel which is stronger than iron its primary element
the electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals
the physical properties such as density reactivity youngs modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element but engineering properties such as tensile strength ductility and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials
this is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors helping the alloy resist deformation
sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present
for example impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties as first predicted by white hogan suhl tian abrie and nakamura
unlike pure metals most alloys do not have a single melting point but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases
the temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus
for many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion called either a eutectic mixture or a peritectic composition which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point and no liquid solid slush transition
alloying elements are added to a base metal to induce hardness toughness ductility or other desired properties
most metals and alloys can be work hardened by creating defects in their crystal structure
these defects are created during plastic deformation by hammering bending extruding et cetera and are permanent unless the metal is recrystallized
otherwise some alloys can also have their properties altered by heat treatment
nearly all metals can be softened by annealing which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling
many alloys of aluminium copper magnesium titanium and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment but few respond to this to the same degree as does steel
the base metal iron of the iron carbon alloy known as steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature
this allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal
when this diffusion happens the carbon atoms are said to be in solution in the iron forming a particular single homogeneous crystalline phase called austenite
if the steel is cooled slowly the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope
during slow cooling the carbon atoms will no longer be as soluble with the iron and will be forced to precipitate out of solution nucleating into a more concentrated form of iron carbide in the spaces between the pure iron crystals
the steel then becomes heterogeneous as it is formed of two phases the iron carbon phase called cementite and pure iron ferrite
such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft
if the steel is cooled quickly however the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide but will be trapped within the iron crystals
when rapidly cooled a diffusionless transformation occurs in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution
this causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile
while the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented most heat treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength
when heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly these alloys become much softer than normal during the diffusionless transformation but then harden as they age
the solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time forming intermetallic phases which are difficult to discern from the base metal
unlike steel in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal
these intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure but tend to behave heterogeneously becoming hard and somewhat brittle
in precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by alfred wilm
precipitation hardening alloys such as certain alloys of aluminium titanium and copper are heat treatable alloys that soften when quenched and then harden over time
wilm had been searching for a way to harden aluminium alloys for use in machine gun cartridge cases
knowing that aluminium copper alloys were heat treatable to some degree wilm tried quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium copper and the addition of magnesium but was initially disappointed with the results
however when wilm retested it the next day he discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature and far exceeded his expectations
although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until duralumin was one of the first age hardening alloys used becoming the primary building material for the first zeppelins and was soon followed by many others
because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry including the construction of modern aircraft
when a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism
the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur
when the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent
this is called a substitutional alloy
examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively
in the case of the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller than the other and can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal
instead the smaller atoms become trapped in the interstitial sites between the atoms of the crystal matrix
this is referred to as an interstitial alloy
steel is an example of an interstitial alloy because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix
stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms
the use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron
it is the main constituent of iron meteorites
as no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel the alloy was used as it was
meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools weapons and nails
in many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads
they were often used as anvils
meteoric iron was very rare and valuable and difficult for ancient people to work
iron is usually found as iron ore on earth except for one deposit of native iron in greenland which was used by the inuit
native copper however was found worldwide along with silver gold and platinum which were also used to make tools jewelry and other objects since neolithic times
copper was the hardest of these metals and the most widely distributed
it became one of the most important metals to the ancients
around years ago in the highlands of anatolia humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore
around bc people began alloying the two metals to form bronze which was much harder than its ingredients
tin was rare however being found mostly in great britain
in the middle east people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass
ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced such as hardness toughness and melting point under various conditions of temperature and work hardening developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams
for example arrowheads from the chinese qin dynasty were often constructed with a hard bronze head but a softer bronze tang combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use
mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years
mercury dissolves many metals such as gold silver and tin to form amalgams
amalgams have been used since bc in china for gilding objects such as armor and mirrors with precious metals
the ancient romans often used mercury tin amalgams for gilding their armor
the amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized leaving the gold silver or tin behind
mercury was often used in mining to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores
many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes
in ancient egypt and mycenae gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red gold or iron to produce a bright burgundy gold
gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold
these metals were also used to strengthen each other for more practical purposes
copper was often added to silver to make sterling silver increasing its strength for use in dishes silverware and other practical items
quite often precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers
around bc archimedes was commissioned by the king of syracuse to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown leading to the famous bath house shouting of eureka upon the discovery of archimedes principle
the term pewter covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin
as a pure metal tin is much too soft to use for most practical purposes
however during the bronze age tin was a rare metal in many parts of europe and the mediterranean so it was often valued higher than gold
to make jewellery cutlery or other objects from tin workers usually alloyed it with other metals to increase strength and hardness
these metals were typically lead antimony bismuth or copper
these solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts or added together making a wide variety of objects ranging from practical items such as dishes surgical tools candlesticks or funnels to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips
the earliest examples of pewter come from ancient egypt around bc
the use of pewter was widespread across europe from france to norway and britain to the near east
the alloy was also used in china and the far east arriving in japan around ad where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels tea canisters or chalices used in shinto shrines
the first known smelting of iron began in anatolia around bc
called the bloomery process it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron
by bc iron making technology had spread to europe arriving in japan around ad
pig iron a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon was being produced in china as early as bc but did not arrive in europe until the middle ages
pig iron has a lower melting point than iron and was used for making cast iron
however these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around bc
these steels were of poor quality and the introduction of pattern welding around the st century ad sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them to create a tougher metal
around ad the japanese began folding bloomery steel and cast iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities
this method of japanese swordsmithing produced one of the purest steel alloys of the ancient world
while the use of iron started to become more widespread around bc mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin the metal was much softer than bronze
however very small amounts of steel was always a byproduct of the bloomery process
the ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since bc and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons
because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the middle ages
this method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time but the absorption of carbon in this manner is extremely slow thus the penetration was not very deep so the alloy was not homogeneous
in benjamin huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel
huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early s
the introduction of the blast furnace to europe in the middle ages meant that people could produce pig iron in much higher volumes than wrought iron
because pig iron could be melted people began to develop processes to reduce carbon in liquid pig iron to create steel
puddling had been used in china since the first century and was introduced in europe during the s where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air to remove the carbon by oxidation
in henry bessemer developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content
the bessemer process led to the first large scale manufacture of steel
steel is an alloy of iron and carbon but the term alloy steel usually only refers to steels that contain other elements like vanadium molybdenum or cobalt in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel
since ancient times when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets
even long after the age of enlightenment the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods
for example the people of sheffield a center of steel production in england were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter industrial espionage
thus almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until
because of this lack of understanding steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between and so alloy steel became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel alloys
after benjamin huntsman developed his crucible steel in he began experimenting with the addition of elements like manganese which helped remove impurities such as phosphorus and oxygen a process adopted by bessemer and still used in modern steels
afterward many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success
however in robert hadfield being a pioneer in steel metallurgy took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around manganese
called mangalloy it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness becoming the first commercially viable alloy steel
afterward he created silicon steel launching the search for other possible alloys of steel
robert forester mushet found that by adding tungsten to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures
mushets special steel became the first high speed steel
mushets steel was quickly replaced by tungsten carbide steel developed by taylor and white in in which they doubled the tungsten content and added small amounts of chromium and vanadium producing a superior steel for use in lathes and machining tools
in the wright brothers used a chromium nickel steel to make the crankshaft for their airplane engine while in henry ford began using vanadium steels for parts like crankshafts and valves in his model t ford due to their higher strength and resistance to high temperatures
in the krupp ironworks in germany developed a rust resistant steel by adding chromium and nickel producing the first stainless steel
due to their high reactivity most metals were not discovered until the th century
a method for extracting aluminium from bauxite was proposed by humphry davy in using an electric arc
although his attempts were unsuccessful by the first sales of pure aluminium reached the market
however as extractive metallurgy was still in its infancy most aluminium extraction processes produced unintended alloys contaminated with other elements found in the ore the most abundant of which was copper
these aluminium copper alloys preceded pure aluminium offering greater strength and hardness over the soft pure metal and to a slight degree were found to be heat treatable
however due to their softness and limited hardenability these alloys found little practical use and were more of a novelty until the wright brothers used an aluminium alloy to construct the first airplane engine in
during the time between and processes for extracting many other metals were discovered such as chromium vanadium tungsten iridium cobalt and molybdenum and various alloys were developed
prior to research mainly consisted of private individuals tinkering in their own laboratories
however as the aircraft and automotive industries began growing research into alloys became an industrial effort in the years following as new magnesium alloys were developed for pistons and wheels in cars and pot metal for levers and knobs and aluminium alloys developed for airframes and aircraft skins were put into use
the doehler die casting co
of toledo ohio were known for the production of brastil a high tensile corrosion resistant bronze alloy
throughout history forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions
movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways
not all artistic revolutions were political
sometimes science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists
the stylistic revolution known as impressionism by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid th century in which the style was born
michel eugne chevreul a french chemist hired as director of dyes at a french tapestry works began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics
chevreul realized it was the eye and not the dye that had the greatest influence on color and from this he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed each imposing its own complementary color on the other
the french painter eugne delacroix who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones embraced chevreuls book the law of contrast of color with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum
inspired by chevreuls treatise delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him
it was chevreul who led the impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewers eye to combine them optically
they were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself
since the renaissance painters had to grind pigment add oil and thus create their own paints these time consuming paints also quickly dried out making studio painting a necessity for large works and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out
in a little known american painter named john g
rand invented a simple improvement without which the impressionist movement could not have occurred the small flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored
oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist usable and portable
for the first time since the renaissance painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried
paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world to directly observe the play of color and natural light in shadow and movement to paint in the moment
selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments chrome yellow cadmium blue invented by th century industrial chemists
the tubes freed the impressionists to paint quickly and across an entire canvas rather than carefully delineated single color sections at a time in short to sketch directly in oil racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of impressionists since such speedy bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions not finished paintings which were to have no visible brush marks at all seamless under layers of varnish
pierre auguste renoir said without colors in tubes there would be no czanne no monet no pissarro and no impressionism
finally the careful hyper realistic techniques of french neo classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid s
it was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention particularly by the french inventor daguerre made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the paris diorama with large scale historical paintings
the neo classical subject matter limited by academic tradition to greek and roman legends historical battles and biblical stories seemed oppressively clichd and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera daily life candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things paris itself rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events
early photographs influenced impressionist style by its use of asymmetry cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography
edgar degas claude monet pierre auguste renoir in their framing use of color light and shadow subject matter put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning
their initial break with realism into an exploration of light color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the abstract expressionists who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war
at first thought of as primitive inept works as in my four year old could do that these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the s and s expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used or even understood
jackson pollock who pioneered splatter painting dispensing with a paint brush altogether soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in life magazine
in fact in a deliberate secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones abstract expressionists like pollock robert motherwell willem de kooning and mark rothko while seemingly difficult pathbreaking artists were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the central intelligence agency in a cold war policy begun in to prove that the united states could foster more artistic freedom than the soviet bloc
it was recognized that abstract expressionism was the kind of art that made socialist realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was said former cia case worker donald jameson who finally broke the silence on this program in
ironically the covert cia support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a european tour of these works during the truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative mccarthy era america with truman famously remarking if thats art im a hottentot
thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using cia funds not their own to sponsor traveling exhibitions of american abstract expressionists all over the world publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit abstract expressionist works in major american and british museums
thomas braden in charge of these cultural programs for the cia in the early years of the cold war had formerly been executive secretary of the museum of modern art americas leading institution for th century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out
agrarianism is a social and political philosophy that promotes subsistence agriculture family farming widespread property ownership and political decentralization
adherents of agrarianism tend to value traditional bonds of local community over urban modernity
agrarian political parties sometimes aim to support the rights and sustainability of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society
some scholars suggest that agrarianism values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values
it stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life
for example m
thomas inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets the philosophical roots of agrarianism include european and chinese philosophers
the chinese school of agriculturalism was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism
in societies influenced by confucianism the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society but merchants who made money were looked down upon
that influenced european intellectuals like franois quesnay an avid confucianist and advocate of chinas agrarian policies in forming the french agrarian philosophy of physiocracy
the physiocrats along with the ideas of john locke and the romantic era formed the basis of modern european and american agrarianism
the united states president thomas jefferson was an agrarian who based his ideas about the budding american democracy around the notion that farmers are the most valuable citizens and the truest republicans
jefferson and his support base were committed to american republicanism which they saw as being in opposition to aristocracy and corruption and which prioritized virtue exemplified by the yeoman farmer planters and the plain folk
in praising the rural farmfolk the jeffersonians felt that financiers bankers and industrialists created cesspools of corruption in the cities and should thus be avoided
the jeffersonians sought to align the american economy more with agriculture than industry
part of their motive to do so was jeffersons fear that the over industrialization of america would create a class of wage slaves who relied on their employers for income and sustenance
in turn these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers
to counter this jefferson introduced as scholar clay jenkinson noted a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward and tariffs on imported articles which were mainly purchased by the wealthy
in jefferson writing to a friend explained these revenues will be levied entirely on the rich
the rich alone use imported articles and on these alone the whole taxes of the general government are levied
the poor man
pays not a farthing of tax to the general government but on his salt
there is general agreement that the substantial united states federal policy of offering land grants had a positive impact on economic development in the th century
agrarian socialism is a form of agrarianism that is anti capitalist in nature and seeks to introduce socialist economic systems in their stead
notable agrarian socialists include emiliano zapata who was a leading figure in the mexican revolution
as part of the liberation army of the south his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the mexican peasants whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes
zapata published plan of ayala which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in mexico as part of the revolution
zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the revolution but his political ideas lived on in the form of zapatismo
zapatismo would form the basis for neozapatismo the ideology of the zapatista army of national liberation
known as ejrcito zapatista de liberacin nacional or ezln in spanish ezln is a far left libertarian socialist political and militant group that emerged in the state of chiapas in southmost mexico in
ezln and neozapatismo as explicit in their name seek to revive the agrarian socialist movement of zapata but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community level decision making
when the land became property of the peasants
when the land passed into the hands of those who work it
was the starting point for advances in government health education housing nutrition womens participation trade culture communication and information
was recovering the means of production in this case the land animals and machines that were in the hands of large property owners
maoism the far left ideology of mao zedong and his followers places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals
in contrast to other marxist schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers maoism sees the peasantry as key
believing that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun maoism saw the chinese peasantry as the prime source for a marxist vanguard because it possessed two qualities they were poor and they were a political blank slate in maos words a clean sheet of paper has no blotches and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it
during the chinese civil war and the second sino japanese war mao and the chinese communist party made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics often eschewing the cities
following the eventual victory of the communist party in both wars the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for mao
in mao launched the great leap forward a social and economic campaign which amongst other things altered many aspects of rural chinese life
it introduced mandatory collective farming and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as peoples communes
these communes which consisted of people on average were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life
the communes were run as co operatives where wages and money were replaced by work points
peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as rightists and counter revolutionaries
leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible and those who attempted it were subjected to party orchestrated public struggle sessions which further jeopardized their survival
these public criticism sessions were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials and they often devolved into little more than public beatings
on the communes experiments were conducted in order to find new methods of planting crops efforts were made to construct new irrigation systems on a massive scale and the communes were all encouraged to produce steel backyard furnaces as part of an effort to increase steel production
however following the anti rightist campaign mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into china and thus engineers often were not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned
similarly the experimentation with the crops did not produce results
in addition to this the four pests campaign was launched in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds in order to protect fields
pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion
this campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population especially crop eating insects which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators
none of these new systems were working but local leaders did not dare to state this instead they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas
in many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas and in turn the chinese state developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the commune system
all of this culminated in the great chinese famine which began in lasted years and saw an estimated to million chinese people die
a combination of bad weather and the new failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food
by the great leap forward was declared to be at an end
in the late s and early s mao once again radically altered life in rural china with the launching of the down to the countryside movement
as a response to the great chinese famine the chinese president liu shaoqi began sending down urban youths to rural china in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities
however mao turned the practice into a political crusade declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants
in reality it was the communist partys attempt to reign in the red guards who had become uncontrollable during the course of the cultural revolution
of the urban population of china was sent out to remote rural villages often in inner mongolia
the villages which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the great chinese famine did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers
furthermore the so called sent down youth had no agricultural experience and as a result they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector
as a result many of the sent down youth died in the countryside
the relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent but by the end of the cultural revolution the communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so
in imitation of maos policies the khmer rouge of cambodia created their own version of the great leap forward which was known as maha lout ploh
with the great leap forward as its model it had similarly disastrous effects contributing to what is now known as the cambodian genocide
as a part of the maha lout ploh the khmer rouge sought to create an entirely agrarian socialist society by forcibly relocating people to move from cambodias cities into newly created communes
the khmer rouge leader pol pot sought to purify the country by setting it back to year zero freeing it from corrupting influences
besides trying to completely de urbanize cambodia ethnic minorities were slaughtered along with anyone else who was suspected of being a reactionary or a member of the bourgeoisie to the point that wearing glasses was seen as grounds for execution
the killings were only brought to an end when cambodia was invaded by the neighboring socialist nation of vietnam whose army toppled the khmer rouge
however with cambodias entire society and economy in disarray including its agricultural sector the country still plunged into renewed famine due to vast food shortages
however as international journalists began to report on the situation and send images of it out to the world a massive international response was provoked leading to one of the most concentrated relief efforts of its time
peasant parties first appeared across eastern europe between and when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers
agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it
they also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements
many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity
peasant parties rarely had any power before world war i but some became influential in the interwar era especially in bulgaria and czechoslovakia
for a while in the s and the s there was a green international based on the peasant parties in bulgaria czechoslovakia poland and serbia
it functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities
in bulgaria the bulgarian agrarian national union was organized in to resist taxes and build cooperatives
bzns came to power in and introduced many economic social and legal reforms
however conservative forces crushed bzns in a coup and assassinated its leader aleksandar stamboliyski
bzns was made into a communist puppet group until when it reorganized as a genuine party
in czechoslovakia the republican party of agricultural and smallholder people often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five party ptka coalition
the partys leader antonn vehla was prime minister several times
it was consistently the strongest party forming and dominating coalitions
it moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle class voters
the party was banned by the national front after the second world war
in france the hunting fishing nature tradition party is a moderate conservative agrarian party reaching a peak of in the french presidential election
it would later on become affiliated to frances main conservative party union for a popular movement
more recently the resistons movement of jean lassalle espoused agrarianism
in hungary the first major agrarian party the small holders party was founded in
the party became part of the government in the s but lost influence in the government
a new party the independent smallholders agrarian workers and civic party was established in with a more radical program representing larger scale land redistribution initiatives
they implemented this program together with the other coalition parties after wwii
however after the party was outlawed when a one party system was introduced
they became part of the government again and after which they lost political support
the ruling fidesz party has an agrarian faction and promotes agrarian interest since with the emphasis now placed on supporting larger family farms versus small holders
in the late th century the irish national land league aimed to abolish landlordism in ireland and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on
the land war of led to the irish land acts ending absentee landlords and ground rent and redistributing land among peasant farmers
post independence the farmers party operated in the irish free state from folding into the national centre party in
it was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of ireland
clann na talmhan was founded in
they focused more on the poor smallholders of the west supporting land reclamation afforestation social democracy and rates reform
they formed part of the governing coalition of the government of the th dil and government of the th dil
economic improvement in the s saw farmers vote for other parties and clann na talmhan disbanded in
in kazakhstan the peasants union originally a communist organization was formed as one of first agrarian parties in independent kazakhstan and would win four seats in the legislative election
the agrarian party of kazakhstan led by romin madinov was founded in which favored the privatization of agricultural land developments towards rural infrastructure as well as changes in the tax system in agrarian economy
the party would go on to win three mjilis seats in the legislative election and eventually unite with the civic party of kazakhstan to form the pro government agrarian industrial union of workers bloc that would be chaired by madinov for the legislative election with the aist bloc winning seats in the mjilis
from there the bloc remained short lived as it would merge with the ruling nur otan party in
several other parties in kazakhstan over the years have embraced agrarian policies in their programs in an effort to appeal towards a large rural kazakh demographic base which included amanat adal and respublica
since late s the auyl peoples democratic patriotic party remains the largest and most influential agrarian oriented party in kazakhstan as its presidential candidate jiguli dairabaev had become the second place frontrunner in the presidential election after sweeping of the vote
in the legislative election the auyl party for the first time was represented the parliament after winning nine seats in the lower chamber mjilis
the party raises rural issues in regard to decaying villages rural development and the agro industrial complex the issues of social security of the rural population and has consistently opposed the ongoing rural flight in kazakhstan
in latvia the union of greens and farmers is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large scale farming nature is threatened by development while small farms are threatened by large industrial scale farms
in lithuania the government led by the lithuanian farmers and greens union was in power between and
in poland the polish peoples party traces its tradition to an agrarian party in austro hungarian controlled galician poland
after the fall of the communist regime psls biggest success came in elections where it won out of parliamentary seats
since then psls support has steadily declined until when they formed polish coalition with an anti establishment direct democracy kukiz party and managed to get of popular vote
moreover psl tends to get much better results in local elections
in elections they have managed to get of votes
the right wing law and justice party has also become supportive of agrarian policies in recent years and polls show that most of their support comes from rural areas
agrounia resembles the features of agrarianism
in romania older party parties from transylvania moldavia and wallachia merged to become the national peasants party in
iuliu maniu was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from to and briefly in but the great depression made proposed reforms impossible
the communist administration dissolved the party in but it reformed in after they fell from power
the reformed party which also incorporated elements of christian democracy in its ideology governed romania as part of the romanian democratic convention between and
in serbia nikola pai and his peoples radical party dominated serbian politics after
the party also monopolized power in yugoslavia from to
during the dictatorship of the s the prime minister was from that party
in ukraine the radical party of oleh lyashko has promised to purify the country of oligarchs with a pitchfork
the party advocates a number of traditional left wing positions and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments
in land law the heyday of english irish agrarianism was to led by the tudor royal advisors who sought to maintain a broad pool of agricultural commoners from which to draw military men against the interests of larger landowners who sought enclosure
the heyday was eroded by hundreds of acts of parliament to expressly permit enclosure chiefly from to the s
politicians standing strongly as reactionaries to this included the levellers those anti industrialists going beyond opposing new weaving technology and later radicals such as william cobbett
a high level of net national or local self sufficiency has a strong base in campaigns and movements
in the th century such empowered advocates included peelites and most conservatives
the th century saw the growth or start of influential non governmental organisations such as the national farmers union of england and wales campaign for rural england friends of the earth and of the england wales scottish and northern irish political parties prefixed by and focussed on green politics
the st century has seen decarbonisation already in electricity markets
following protests and charitable lobbying local food has seen growing market share sometimes backed by wording in public policy papers and manifestos
the uk has many sustainability prioritising businesses green charity campaigns events and lobby groups ranging from espousing allotment gardens through to a clear policy of local food and or self sustainability models
historian fk crowley finds that the national party of australia from the s to the s promulgated its version of agrarianism which it called countrymindedness
the goal was to enhance the status of the graziers and small farmers and justified subsidies for them
the new zealand liberal party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday
the landed gentry and aristocracy ruled britain at this time
new zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before
the liberal party set out to change that by a policy it called populism
richard seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as it is the rich and the poor it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes
that sir shows the real political position of new zealand
the liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported liberal ideals
the liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed a system for settling industrial disputes which was accepted by both employers and trade unions
in it extended voting rights to women making new zealand the first country in the world to do so
to obtain land for farmers the liberal government from to purchased of maori land
the government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers
the advances to settlers act provided low interest mortgages and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods
the liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian anti monopoly land policy
the policy built up support for the liberal party in rural north island electorates
by the liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in parliament
the united states and canada both saw a rise of agrarian oriented parties in the early twentieth century as economic troubles motivated farming communities to become politically active
it has been proposed that different responses to agrarian protest largely determined the course of power generated by these newly energized rural factions
according to sociologist barry eidlinin the united states democrats adopted a co optive response to farmer and labor protest incorporating these constituencies into the new deal coalition
in canada both mainstream parties adopted a coercive response leaving these constituencies politically excluded and available for an independent left coalition
these reactions may have helped determine the outcome of agrarian power and political associations in the us and canada
economic desperation experienced by farmers across the state of kansas in the nineteenth century spurred the creation of the peoples party in and soon after would gain control of the governors office in
this party consisting of a mix of democrats socialists populists and fusionists would find itself buckling from internal conflict regarding the unlimited coinage of silver
the populists permanently lost power in
oklahoma farmers considered their political activity during the early twentieth century due to the outbreak of war depressed crop prices and an inhibited sense of progression towards owning their own farms
tenancy had been reportedly as high as in oklahoma by
these pressures saw agrarian counties in oklahoma supporting socialist policies and politics with the socialist platform proposing a deeply agrarian radical platform
the platform proposed a renters and farmers program which was strongly agrarian radical in its insistence upon various measures to put land into the hands of the actual tillers of the soil
although it did not propose to nationalize privately owned land it did offer numerous plans to enlarge the states public domain from which land would be rented at prevailing share rents to tenants until they had paid rent equal to the lands value
the tenant and his children would have the right of occupancy and use but the title would remind in the commonwealth an arrangement that might be aptly termed socialist fee simple
they proposed to exempt from taxation all farm dwellings animals and improvements up to the value of
the state board of agriculture would encourage co operative societies of farmers to make plans f or the purchase of land seed tools and for preparing and selling produce
in order to give farmers essential services at cost the socialists called for the creation of state banks and mortgage agencies crop insurance elevators and warehousesthis agrarian backed socialist party would win numerous offices causing a panic within the local democratic party
this agrarian socialist movement would be inhibited by voter suppression laws aimed at reducing the participation of voters of color as well as national wartime policies intended to disrupt political elements considered subversive
this party would peak in power in
agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the back to the land movement
agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society and on simple living even when the shift involves questioning the progressive character of some recent social and economic developments
thus agrarianism is not industrial farming with its specialization on products and industrial scale
in euclidean geometry an angle is the figure formed by two rays called the sides of the angle sharing a common endpoint called the vertex of the angle
angles formed by two rays are also known as plane angles as they lie in the plane that contains the rays
angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes these are called dihedral angles
two intersecting curves may also define an angle which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection
the magnitude of an angle is called an angular measure or simply angle
angle of rotation is a measure conventionally defined as the ratio of a circular arc length to its radius and may be a negative number
in the case of a geometric angle the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides
in the case of a rotation the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation
the word angle comes from the latin word meaning corner
cognate words include the greek meaning crooked curved and the english word ankle
both are connected with the proto indo european root ank meaning to bend or bow
euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other in a plane of two lines that meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other
according to the neoplatonic metaphysician proclus an angle must be either a quality a quantity or a relationship
the first concept angle as quality was used by eudemus of rhodes who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line the second angle as quality by carpus of antioch who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines euclid adopted the third angle as a relationship
in mathematical expressions it is common to use greek letters as variables denoting the size of some angle
lower case roman letters are also used
in contexts where this is not confusing an angle may be denoted by the upper case roman letter denoting its vertex
see the figures in this article for examples
the three defining points may also identify angles in geometric figures
for example the angle with vertex a formed by the rays ab and ac is denoted or formula
where there is no risk of confusion the angle may sometimes be referred to by a single vertex alone
in other ways an angle denoted as say might refer to any of four angles the clockwise angle from b to c about a the anticlockwise angle from b to c about a the clockwise angle from c to b about a or the anticlockwise angle from c to b about a where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign
however in many geometrical situations it is evident from the context that the positive angle less than or equal to degrees is meant and in these cases no ambiguity arises
otherwise to avoid ambiguity specific conventions may be adopted so that for instance always refers to the anticlockwise angle from b to c about a and the anticlockwise angle from c to b about a
when two straight lines intersect at a point four angles are formed
pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other
a transversal is a line that intersects a pair of lines and is associated with exterior angles interior angles alternate exterior angles alternate interior angles corresponding angles and consecutive interior angles
the angle addition postulate states that if b is in the interior of angle aoc then formula ie the measure of the angle aoc is the sum of the measure of angle aob and the measure of angle boc
the size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other
angles of the same size are said to be equal congruent or equal in measure
in some contexts such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent
in other contexts such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing an objects cumulative rotation in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation angles that differ by a non zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent
to measure an angle a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn eg with a pair of compasses
the ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle formula conventionally in mathematics and the si the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless unit thus being normally omitted
formula the value of thus defined is independent of the size of the circle if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion so the ratio s r is unaltered
throughout history angles have been measured in various units
these are known as angular units with the most contemporary units being the degree the radian and the gradian though many others have been used throughout history
most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn is equal to n units for some whole number n
two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part
in the international system of quantities an angle is defined as a dimensionless quantity and in particular the radian unit is dimensionless
this convention impacts how angles are treated in dimensional analysis
the following table list some units used to represent angles
it is frequently helpful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and or rotations in opposite directions or sense relative to some reference
in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system an angle is typically defined by its two sides with its vertex at the origin
the initial side is on the positive x axis while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians degrees or turns with positive angles representing rotations toward the positive y axis and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y axis
when cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position defined by the x axis rightward and the y axis upward positive rotations are anticlockwise and negative cycles are clockwise
in many contexts an angle of is effectively equivalent to an angle of one full turn minus
for example an orientation represented as is effectively equal to an orientation defined as or
although the final position is the same a physical rotation of is not the same as a rotation of
in three dimensional geometry clockwise and anticlockwise have no absolute meaning so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation which is typically determined by a normal vector passing through the angles vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie
in navigation bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north
by convention viewed from above bearing angles are positive clockwise so a bearing of corresponds to a north east orientation
negative bearings are not used in navigation so a north west orientation corresponds to a bearing of
for an angular unit it is definitional that the angle addition postulate holds
some quantities related to angles where the angle addition postulate does not hold include the angle between a line and a curve or between two intersecting curves is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection
various names have been given to particular cases amphicyrtic or cissoidal biconvex xystroidal or sistroidal concavo convex amphicoelic or angulus lunularis biconcave
the ancient greek mathematicians knew how to bisect an angle using only a compass and straightedge but could only trisect certain angles
in pierre wantzel showed that this construction could not be performed for most angles
in the euclidean space the angle between two euclidean vectors u and v is related to their dot product and their lengths by the formula formula this formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes from their normal vectors and between skew lines from their vector equations
to define angles in an abstract real inner product space we replace the euclidean dot product by the inner product formula ie formula in a complex inner product space the expression for the cosine above may give non real values so it is replaced with formula or more commonly using the absolute value with formula the latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors
it thus describes the angle between one dimensional subspaces formula and formula spanned by the vectors formula and formula correspondingly
the definition of the angle between one dimensional subspaces formula and formula given by formula in a hilbert space can be extended to subspaces of finite dimensions
given two subspaces formula formula with formula this leads to a definition of formula angles called canonical or principal angles between subspaces
in riemannian geometry the metric tensor is used to define the angle between two tangents
where u and v are tangent vectors and gij are the components of the metric tensor g formula a hyperbolic angle is an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function
the comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case
unlike the circular angle the hyperbolic angle is unbounded
when the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions
this comparison of the two series corresponding to functions of angles was described by leonhard euler in introduction to the analysis of the infinite
in geography the location of any point on the earth can be identified using a geographic coordinate system
this system specifies the latitude and longitude of any location in terms of angles subtended at the center of the earth using the equator and the greenwich meridian as references
in astronomy a given point on the celestial sphere can be identified using any of several astronomical coordinate systems where the references vary according to the particular system
astronomers measure the angular separation of two stars by imagining two lines through the center of the earth each intersecting one of the stars
the angle between those lines and the angular separation between the two stars can be measured
in both geography and astronomy a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a vertical angle such as altitude elevation with respect to the horizon as well as the azimuth with respect to north
astronomers also measure objects apparent size as an angular diameter
for example the full moon has an angular diameter of approximately when viewed from earth
one could say the moons diameter subtends an angle of half a degree
the small angle formula can convert such an angular measurement into a distance size ratio
these measurements depend on the individual subject and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only
in astronomy right ascension and declination are usually measured in angular units expressed in terms of time based on a hour day
acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including topics such as vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound
a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer
the application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries
hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture
accordingly the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society music medicine architecture industrial production warfare and more
likewise animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or for marking territories
art craft science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole as in many other fields of knowledge
robert bruce lindsays wheel of acoustics is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics
the word acoustic is derived from the greek word meaning of or for hearing ready to hear and that from heard audible which in turn derives from the verb i hear
the latin synonym is sonic after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics
frequencies above and below the audible range are called ultrasonic and infrasonic respectively
in the th century bc the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string
he is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers the tones produced will be harmonious and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds
for example a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length
in modern parlance if a string sounds the note c when plucked a string twice as long will sound a c an octave lower
in one system of musical tuning the tones in between are then given by for d for e for f for g for a and for b in ascending order
aristotle understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it
a very good expression of the nature of wave motion
on things heard generally ascribed to strato of lampsacus states that the pitch is related to the frequency of vibrations of the air and to the speed of sound
in about bc the roman architect and engineer vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference echoes and reverberation the beginnings of architectural acoustics
in book v of his vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions which when interrupted by obstructions would flow back and break up following waves
he described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth fifth and so on up to the double octave in order to resonate with the more desirable harmonious notes
during the islamic golden age ab rayhn al brn is believed to have postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light
the physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the scientific revolution
mainly galileo galilei but also marin mersenne independently discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings
galileo wrote waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body which spread through the air bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics
experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between and by a number of investigators prominently mersenne
meanwhile newton derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids a cornerstone of physical acoustics
substantial progress in acoustics resting on firmer mathematical and physical concepts was made during the eighteenth century by euler lagrange and dalembert
during this era continuum physics or field theory began to receive a definite mathematical structure
the wave equation emerged in a number of contexts including the propagation of sound in air
in the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were helmholtz in germany who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics and lord rayleigh in england who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work the theory of sound
also in the th century wheatstone ohm and henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics
the twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place
the first such application was sabines groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics and many others followed
underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first world war
sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society
sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing
the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry
new kinds of transducers were invented and put to use
acoustics is defined by ansi asa s as science of sound including its production transmission and effects including biological and psychological effects
those qualities of a room that together determine its character with respect to auditory effects
the study of acoustics revolves around the generation propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations
the steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process
there are many kinds of cause both natural and volitional
there are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy producing a sound wave
there is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation the acoustic wave equation but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex
the wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium
eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms in ways that again may be natural and or volitionally contrived
the final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains
the five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake a submarine using sonar to locate its foe or a band playing in a rock concert
the central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation
this falls within the domain of physical acoustics
in fluids sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave
in solids mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves transverse waves and surface waves
acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment
this interaction can be described as either a diffraction interference or a reflection or a mix of the three
if several media are present a refraction can also occur
transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics
in fluids such as air and water sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level
while this disturbance is usually small it is still noticeable to the human ear
the smallest sound that a person can hear known as the threshold of hearing is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure
the loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels
physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies partly because this is how our ears interpret sound
what we experience as higher pitched or lower pitched sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second
in a common technique of acoustic measurement acoustic signals are sampled in time and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots
both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon
the entire spectrum can be divided into three sections audio ultrasonic and infrasonic
the audio range falls between hz and hz
this range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear
this range has a number of applications including speech communication and music
the ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies hz and higher
this range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies
medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range
on the other end of the spectrum the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range
these frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes
analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties
the spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character
a transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another
in an electroacoustic context this means converting sound energy into electrical energy
electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers microphones particle velocity sensors hydrophones and sonar projectors
these devices convert a sound wave to or from an electric signal
the most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism electrostatics and piezoelectricity
the transducers in most common loudspeakers are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil sending off pressure waves
electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics as the sound wave strikes the microphones diaphragm it moves and induces a voltage change
the ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers
these are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself
an acoustician is an expert in the science of sound
there are many types of acoustician but they usually have a bachelors degree or higher qualification
some possess a degree in acoustics while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering
much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in mathematics and science
many acoustic scientists work in research and development
some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception of speech music and noise
other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments eg underwater acoustics architectural acoustics or structural acoustics
other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below
acoustic scientists work in government university and private industry laboratories
many go on to work in acoustical engineering
some positions such as faculty require a doctor of philosophy
archaeoacoustics also known as the archaeology of sound is one of the only ways to experience the past with senses other than our eyes
archaeoacoustics is studied by testing the acoustic properties of prehistoric sites including caves
iegor rezkinoff a sound archaeologist studies the acoustic properties of caves through natural sounds like humming and whistling
archaeological theories of acoustics are focused around ritualistic purposes as well as a way of echolocation in the caves
in archaeology acoustic sounds and rituals directly correlate as specific sounds were meant to bring ritual participants closer to a spiritual awakening
parallels can also be drawn between cave wall paintings and the acoustic properties of the cave they are both dynamic
because archaeoacoustics is a fairly new archaeological subject acoustic sound is still being tested in these prehistoric sites today
aeroacoustics is the study of noise generated by air movement for instance via turbulence and the movement of sound through the fluid air
this knowledge is applied in acoustical engineering to study how to quieten aircraft
aeroacoustics is important for understanding how wind musical instruments work
acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals
applications include active noise control design for hearing aids or cochlear implants echo cancellation music information retrieval and perceptual coding
architectural acoustics involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve good sound within a building
it typically involves the study of speech intelligibility speech privacy music quality and vibration reduction in the built environment
commonly studied environments are hospitals classrooms dwellings performance venues recording and broadcasting studios
focus considerations include room acoustics airborne and impact transmission in building structures airborne and structure borne noise control noise control of building systems and electroacoustic systems bioacoustics is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat
this subdiscipline is concerned with the recording manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics
this might include products such as mobile phones large scale public address systems or virtual reality systems in research laboratories
environmental acoustics is concerned with noise and vibration caused by railways road traffic aircraft industrial equipment and recreational activities
the main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration
research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments soundscapes and tranquility
musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments the audio signal processing used in electronic music the computer analysis of music and composition and the perception and cognitive neuroscience of music
the goal this acoustics sub discipline is to reduce the impact of unwanted sound
scope of noise studies includes the generation propagation and impact on structures objects and people
noise research investigates the impact of noise on humans and animals to include work in definitions abatement transportation noise hearing protection jet and rocket noise building system noise and vibration atmospheric sound propagation soundscapes and low frequency sound
many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition or more commonly known as psychoacoustics in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects
the information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics
psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks feels or even behaves
this correlation can be viewed in normal everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause ones foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene
in a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music
by observing how the central nervous system which includes the brain and spine is influenced by acoustics the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind and essentially the body is evident
acousticians study the production processing and perception of speech
speech recognition and speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers
the subject also overlaps with the disciplines of physics physiology psychology and linguistics
applications might include ground vibrations from railways vibration isolation to reduce vibration in operating theatres studying how vibration can damage health vibration control to protect a building from earthquakes or measuring how structure borne sound moves through buildings
ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans
specialisms include medical ultrasonics sonochemistry ultrasonic testing material characterisation and underwater acoustics
underwater acoustics is the scientific study of natural and man made sounds underwater
applications include sonar to locate submarines underwater communication by whales climate change monitoring by measuring sea temperatures acoustically sonic weapons and marine bioacoustics
atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus
atomic physics typically refers to the study of atomic structure and the interaction between atoms
it is primarily concerned with the way in which electrons are arranged around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change
this comprises ions neutral atoms and unless otherwise stated it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions
the term atomic physics can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard english
physicists distinguish between atomic physics which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons and nuclear physics which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei
as with many scientific fields strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic molecular and optical physics
physics research groups are usually so classified
atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation
atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons
it is not concerned with the formation of molecules nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter
it is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles
while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time scales for atom atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered
this means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation as the vast majority of the time they are
by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms
electrons form notional shells around the nucleus
these are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light magnetic fields or interaction with a colliding particle
if the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy it will be transferred to an excited state
after a certain time the electron in an excited state will jump to a lower state
in a neutral atom the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy since energy is conserved
if an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital
in this case a visible photon or a characteristic x ray is emitted or a phenomenon known as the auger effect may take place where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron causing it to go into the continuum
the auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon
there are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes
one of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed of atoms
it forms a part of the texts written in th century bc to nd century bc such as those of democritus or written by
this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element by the british chemist and physicist john dalton in the th century
at this stage it wasnt clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties
the invention of the periodic system of elements by dmitri mendeleev was another great step forward
the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon most notably by joseph von fraunhofer
the study of these lines led to the bohr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics
in seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed
as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned not only did this yield a better overall description ie the atomic orbital model but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry and spectroscopy
since the second world war both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace
this can be attributed to progress in computing technology which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes
similar technological advances in accelerators detectors magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work
american sign language is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of deaf communities in the united states and most of anglophone canada
asl is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features
besides north america dialects of asl and asl based creoles are used in many countries around the world including much of west africa and parts of southeast asia
asl is also widely learned as a second language serving as a lingua franca
asl is most closely related to french sign language
it has been proposed that asl is a creole language of lsf although asl shows features atypical of creole languages such as agglutinative morphology
asl originated in the early th century in the american school for the deaf in hartford connecticut from a situation of language contact
since then asl use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations
despite its wide use no accurate count of asl users has been taken
reliable estimates for american asl users range from to persons including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals
asl signs have a number of phonemic components such as movement of the face the torso and the hands
asl is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in asl than in spoken languages
english loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling although asl grammar is unrelated to that of english
asl has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers
many linguists believe asl to be a subject verb object language
however there are several alternative proposals to account for asl word order
asl emerged as a language in the american school for the deaf founded by thomas gallaudet in which brought together old french sign language various village sign languages and home sign systems
asl was created in that situation by language contact
asl was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them
the influence of french sign language on asl is readily apparent for example it has been found that about of signs in modern asl are cognate to old french sign language signs
however that is far less than the standard measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects
that suggests that nascent asl was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the asd students although the schools original director laurent clerc taught in lsf
in fact clerc reported that he often learned the students signs rather than conveying lsf it has been proposed that asl is a creole in which lsf is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages
however more recent research has shown that modern asl does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages
asl may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time but it is also possible that it was never a creole type language
there are modality specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face head torso and other body parts
that might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology
additionally clerc and thomas hopkins gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true lsf
although the united states the united kingdom and australia share english as a common oral and written language asl is not mutually intelligible with either british sign language or auslan
all three languages show degrees of borrowing from english but that alone is not sufficient for cross language comprehension
it has been found that a relatively high percentage of asl signs have similar translations in auslan which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family
however that does not seem justified historically for asl and auslan and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with english
american sign language is growing in popularity in many states
many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language but until recently it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective
asl users however have a very distinct culture and they interact very differently when they talk
their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating
they also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart
american sign language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such
in some states however this is only true with regard to high school coursework
prior to the birth of asl sign language had been used by various communities in the united states
in the united states as elsewhere in the world hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation
as early as at first contact by francisco vsquez de coronado there were reports that the indigenous peoples of the great plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines
in the th century a triangle of village sign languages developed in new england one in marthas vineyard massachusetts one in henniker new hampshire and one in sandy river valley maine
marthas vineyard sign language which was particularly important for the history of asl was used mainly in chilmark massachusetts
due to intermarriage in the original community of english settlers of the s and the recessive nature of genetic deafness chilmark had a high rate of genetic deafness
mvsl was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate such as during church sermons or between boats at sea
asl is thought to have originated in the american school for the deaf founded in hartford connecticut in
originally known as the american asylum at hartford for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb the school was founded by the yale graduate and divinity student thomas hopkins gallaudet
gallaudet inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl alice cogswell traveled to europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from european institutions
ultimately gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the french institut national de jeunes sourds de paris and convinced laurent clerc an assistant to the schools founder charles michel de lpe to accompany him back to the united states
upon his return gallaudet founded the asd on april
the largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from marthas vineyard and they brought mvsl with them
there were also students from around henniker new hampshire and from the sandy river valley in maine each of which had their own village sign language
other students brought knowledge of their own home signs
laurent clerc the first teacher at asd taught using french sign language which itself had developed in the parisian school for the deaf established in
from that situation of language contact a new language emerged now known as asl
more schools for the deaf were founded after asd and knowledge of asl spread to those schools
in addition the rise of deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of asl
societies such as the national association of the deaf and the national fraternal society of the deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country
all of that contributed to asls wide use over a large geographical area atypical of a sign language
while oralism an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language had previously been used in american schools the milan congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the united states and europe
however the efforts of deaf advocates and educators more lenient enforcement of the congresss mandate and the use of asl in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to european sign languages albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from english as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language
nevertheless oralism remained the predominant method of deaf education up to the s
linguists did not consider sign language to be true language but as something inferior
recognition of the legitimacy of asl was achieved by william stokoe a linguist who arrived at gallaudet university in when that was still the dominant assumption
aided by the civil rights movement of the s stokoe argued for manualism the use of sign language in deaf education
stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication and even devised a transcription system for asl
in doing so stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics
in the s asl was sometimes referred to as ameslan but that term is now considered obsolete
counting the number of asl signers is difficult because asl users have never been counted by the american census
the ultimate source for current estimates of the number of asl users in the united states is a report for the national census of the deaf population by schein and delk
based on a survey of the ncdp schein and delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between and
the survey did not distinguish between asl and other forms of signing in fact the name asl was not yet in widespread use
incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of asl users in the united states based on misunderstandings of known statistics
demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of asl use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use asl in the home
that accounts for currently cited estimations that are greater than such mistaken estimations can reach as high as
a person lower bound has been cited for asl users the source of that figure is unclear but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing
asl is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third or fourth most spoken language in the united states
those figures misquote schein and delk who actually concluded that asl speakers constituted the third largest population requiring an interpreter in court
although that would make asl the third most used language among monolinguals other than english it does not imply that it is the fourth most spoken language in the united states since speakers of other languages may also speak english
asl is used throughout anglo america
that contrasts with europe where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent
the unique situation of asl seems to have been caused by the proliferation of asl through schools influenced by the american school for the deaf wherein asl originated and the rise of community organizations for the deaf
throughout west africa asl based sign languages are signed by educated deaf adults
such languages imported by boarding schools are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly such as nigerian sign language ghanaian sign language
such signing systems are found in benin burkina faso ivory coast ghana liberia mauritania mali nigeria and togo
due to lack of data it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of asl used in america
in addition to the aforementioned west african countries asl is reported to be used as a first language in barbados bolivia cambodia the central african republic chad china the democratic republic of the congo gabon jamaica kenya madagascar the philippines singapore and zimbabwe
asl is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world widely learned as a second language
sign production can often vary according to location
signers from the south tend to sign with more flow and ease
native signers from new york have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper
sign production of native californian signers has also been reported as being fast
research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas
that conclusion also supports how the ease with which southerners sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the south in comparison to that of the coasts
sign production can also vary depending on age and native language
for example sign production of letters may vary in older signers
slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age
additionally signers who learned american sign language as a second language vary in production
for deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning american sign language qualities of their native language may show in their asl production
some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body instead of away from it and signing certain movement from bottom to top instead of top to bottom
hearing people who learn american sign language also have noticeable differences in signing production
the most notable production difference of hearing people learning american sign language is their rhythm and arm posture
most popularly there are variants of the signs for english words such as birthday pizza halloween early and soon just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change
the sign for school is commonly varied between black and white signers the variants used by black signers are sometimes called black american sign language
social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by deaf gay men for words such as pain and protest
the prevalence of residential deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the united states
deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides
that limited access to signers from other regions combined with the residential quality of deaf schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants
native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education
it is hypothesized that because of that seclusion certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school signers in the community
however american sign language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages
that is because when deaf education was beginning in the united states many educators flocked to the american school for the deaf in hartford connecticut whose central location for the first generation of educators in deaf education to learn american sign language allows asl to be more standardized than its variant
varieties of asl are found throughout the world
there is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the united states and canada
mutual intelligibility among those asl varieties is high and the variation is primarily lexical
for example there are three different words for english about in canadian asl the standard way and two regional variations
variation may also be phonological meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region
for example an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes l and in signs with one handshape
there is also a distinct variety of asl used by the black deaf community
black asl evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states which included the residential schools for the deaf
black asl differs from standard asl in vocabulary phonology and some grammatical structure
while african american english is generally viewed as more innovating than standard english black asl is more conservative than standard asl preserving older forms of many signs
black sign language speakers use more two handed signs than in mainstream asl are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead and use a wider signing space
modern black asl borrows a number of idioms from aae for instance the aae idiom i feel you is calqued into black asl
asl is used internationally as a lingua franca and a number of closely related sign languages derived from asl are used in many different countries
even so there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard asl in those imported asl varieties
bolivian sign language is reported to be a dialect of asl no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects
on the other hand it is also known that some imported asl varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages
for example malaysian sign language which has asl origins is no longer mutually comprehensible with asl and must be considered its own language
for some imported asl varieties such as those used in west africa it is still an open question how similar they are to american asl
when communicating with hearing english speakers asl speakers often use what is commonly called pidgin signed english or contact signing a blend of english structure with asl vocabulary
various types of pse exist ranging from highly english influenced pse to pse which is quite close to asl lexically and grammatically but may alter some subtle features of asl grammar
fingerspelling may be used more often in pse than it is normally used in asl
there have been some constructed sign languages known as manually coded english which match english grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs those systems are not considered to be varieties of asl
tactile asl is a variety of asl used throughout the united states by and with the deaf blind
it is particularly common among those with ushers syndrome
it results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life consequently those with ushers syndrome often grow up in the deaf community using asl and later transition to tasl
tasl differs from asl in that signs are produced by touching the palms and there are some grammatical differences from standard asl in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing
asl changes over time and from generation to generation
the sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed
the development of telephones with screens has also changed asl encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens
in the white house published a response to a petition that gained over signatures to officially recognize american sign language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools
the response is titled there shouldnt be any stigma about american sign language and addressed that asl is a vital language for the deaf and hard of hearing
stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in childrens lives when they can access languages most effectively
scholars such as beth s
benedict advocate not only for bilingualism but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf
york university psychologist ellen bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life
most children born to deaf parents are hearing
known as codas they are often more culturally deaf than deaf children most of whom are born to hearing parents
unlike many deaf children codas acquire asl as well as deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth
such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being slow learners or as having language difficulties because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language
although there is no well established writing system for asl written sign language dates back almost two centuries
the first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of roch ambroise auguste bbian developed in
however written sign language remained marginal among the public
in the s linguist william stokoe created stokoe notation specifically for asl
it is alphabetic with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic hand shape orientation motion and position though it lacks any representation of facial expression and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text
stokoe used that system for his a dictionary of american sign language on linguistic principles
signwriting proposed in by valerie sutton is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the unicode standard
signwriting consists of more than distinct iconic graphs glyphs
currently it is in use in many schools for the deaf particularly in brazil and has been used in international sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than countries including brazil ethiopia france germany italy portugal saudi arabia slovenia tunisia and the united states
sutton signwriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written
the systematic examination of the international sign writing alphabet as an equivalent usage structure to the international phonetic alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed
according to some researchers signwriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one to one map from phonological forms to written forms
that assertion has been disputed and the process for each country to look at the iswa and create a phonemic morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers msc
roberto cesar reis da costa and madson barreto in a thesis forum on june
the signwriting community has an open project on wikimedia labs to support the various wikimedia projects on wikimedia incubator and elsewhere involving signwriting
the asl wikipedia request was marked as eligible in and the test asl wikipedia has articles written in asl using signwriting
the most widely used transcription system among academics is hamnosys developed at the university of hamburg
based on stokoe notation hamnosys was expanded to about graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language
phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol
several additional candidates for written asl have appeared over the years including signfont asl phabet and sis
for english speaking audiences asl is often glossed using english words
such glosses are typically all capitalized and are arranged in asl order
for example the asl sentence dog now chaseix cat meaning the dog is chasing the cat uses now to mark asl progressive aspect and shows asl verbal inflection for the third person
however glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of asl
each sign in asl is composed of a number of distinctive components generally referred to as parameters
a sign may use one hand or both
all signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages which are handshape movement palm orientation location and nonmanual markers
just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like asl
changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign as illustrated by the asl signs think and disappointed there are also meaningful nonmanual signals in asl which may include movement of the eyebrows the cheeks the nose the head the torso and the eyes
william stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages
there has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation
as in spoken languages those phonological units can be split into distinctive features
for instance the handshapes and are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature closed thumb as illustrated to the right
asl has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions
there is ongoing research into whether asl has an analog of syllables in spoken language
asl has a rich system of verbal inflection which involves both grammatical aspect how the action of verbs flows in time and agreement marking
aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb for example continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic circular movement while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position
verbs may agree with both the subject and the object and are marked for number and reciprocity
reciprocity is indicated by using two one handed signs for example the sign shoot made with an l shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb inflects to shoot articulated by having two l shaped hands shooting at each other
asl has a productive system of classifiers which are used to classify objects and their movement in space
for example a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent v classifier handshape with a downhill directed path if the rabbit is hopping the path is executed with a bouncy manner
in general classifiers are composed of a classifier handshape bound to a movement root
the classifier handshape represents the object as a whole incorporating such attributes as surface depth and shape and is usually very iconic
the movement root consists of a path a direction and a manner
in linguistics there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word derivation and inflection
derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category
for example adding the suffix ship to the noun friend creates the new word friendship which has a different meaning than the original word
inflection on the other hand involves modifying a words form to indicate grammatical features such as tense number gender person case and degree of comparison
in american sign language inflection is conveyed through facial expressions body movements and other non manual markers
for instance to indicate past tense in asl one might sign the present tense of a verb and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past
while inflection does not change the basic meaning or category of a word it does provide additional information that helps us better understand how the word is being used in a sentence
this is similar to how subtitles in a movie provide additional information without altering the content of the film itself
according to the book linguistics of american sign language asl signs have two main components hold segments and movement segments
hold segments consist of hand shape location orientation and non manual features while movement segments possess similar features
morphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units
the smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a morpheme with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units while others must occur with other morphemes
for example the plural s and third person s in english are bound morphemes
in asl the handshape in signs like three weeks and three months are also bound morphemes
affixes which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings are part of the derivational process
for example in english prefixes like re and suffixes like able are affixes
in asl affixation can be used to modify the sign for chair to indicate different types of chairs
the inflectional process on the other hand adds grammatical information to existing units
by studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning
understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed
furthermore understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching
for example teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the languages grammar and syntax and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary
in summary morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages
by understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned
american sign language possesses a set of signs known as the american manual alphabet which can be used to spell out words from the english language
it is rather a representation of the english alphabet and not a unique alphabet of asl although commonly labeled as the asl alphabet
it is borrowed from french sign language as much of asl is derived from lsf
such signs make use of the handshapes of asl
for example the signs for p and k use the same handshape but different orientations
a common misconception is that asl consists only of fingerspelling although such a method has been used it is not asl
fingerspelling is a form of borrowing a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another
in asl fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native asl equivalent
there are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled either very short english words or abbreviations of longer english words eg o n from english on and a p t from english apartment
fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise
asl is a subject verb object language but various phenomena affect that basic word order
basic svo sentences are signed without any pauses however other word orders may also occur since asl allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence initial position a phenomenon known as topicalization
in object subject verb sentences the object is topicalized marked by a forward head tilt and a pause asl also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied rather than stated explicitly
subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence and the subject is then omitted from its original position yielding a verb object subject construction topicalization accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy can produce yet another word order object verb subject
those properties of asl allow it a variety of word orders leading many to question which is the true underlying basic order
there are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in asl
one proposal is that languages like asl are best described with a topic comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties
another hypothesis is that asl exhibits free word order in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods eyebrow movement and body position
common misconceptions are that signs are iconically self explanatory that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean or even that they are pantomime
in fact many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols or their iconicity has been obscured over time
even so in asl iconicity plays a significant role a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way
that may be because the medium of sign three dimensional space naturally allows more iconicity than oral language
in the era of the influential linguist ferdinand de saussure it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary
although onomatopoeia is a clear exception since words like choo choo bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic the saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions
asl with its significant inventory of iconic signs directly challenges that theory
research on acquisition of pronouns in asl has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning
it has been found that when children acquire the pronoun you the iconicity of the point is often confused being treated more like a name
that is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition
it has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs
in computing an applet is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program often as a plug in
the term is frequently used to refer to a java applet a program written in the java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page
applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that do not monopolize the users attention
applets are not full featured application programs and are intended to be easily accessible
the word applet was first used in in pc magazine
however the concept of an applet or more broadly a small interpreted program downloaded and executed by the user dates at least to rfc by jeff rulifson which described the decode encode language which was designed to allow remote use of the on line system over arpanet by downloading small programs to enhance the interaction
this has been specifically credited as a forerunner of javas downloadable programs in rfc
in some cases an applet does not run independently
these applets must run either in a container provided by a host program through a plugin or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model
applets were used to provide interactive features to web applications that historically could not be provided by html alone
they could capture mouse input and also had controls like buttons or check boxes
in response to the user action an applet could change the provided graphic content
this made applets well suited for demonstration visualization and teaching
there were online applet collections for studying various subjects from physics to heart physiology
applets were also used to create online game collections that allowed players to compete against live opponents in real time
an applet could also be a text area only providing for instance a cross platform command line interface to some remote system
if needed an applet could leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window
however applets had very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area so they were less useful for improving the site appearance in general
applets could also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser
html pages could embed parameters that were passed to the applet
hence the same applet could appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed
a java applet is a java program that is launched from html and run in a web browser
it takes code from server and run in a web browser
it can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by html
since javas bytecode is platform independent java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms including windows unix macos and linux
when a java technology enabled web browser processes a page that contains an applet the applets code is transferred to the clients system and executed by the browsers java virtual machine
an html page references an applet either via the deprecated tag or via its replacement the tag
recent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and embedded systems have led to the awareness of the security of applets
applets in an open platform environment should provide secure interactions between different applications
a compositional approach can be used to provide security for open platform applets
advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions
a java applet contains different security models unsigned java applet security signed java applet security and self signed java applet security
in an applet enabled web browser many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets
a malicious applet can infect a computer system in many ways including denial of service invasion of privacy and annoyance
a typical solution for malicious applets is to make the web browser to monitor applets activities
this will result in a web browser that will enable the manual or automatic stopping of malicious applets
alternate history is a subgenre of speculative fiction in which one or more historical events have occurred but are resolved differently than in actual history
as conjecture based upon historical fact alternate history stories propose what if scenarios about crucial events in human history and present outcomes very different from the historical record
some alternate histories are considered a subgenre of science fiction or historical fiction
since the s as a subgenre of science fiction some alternative history stories have featured the tropes of time travel between histories the psychic awareness of the existence of an alternative universe by the inhabitants of a given universe and time travel that divides history into various timestreams
often described as a subgenre of science fiction alternative history is a genre of fiction wherein the author speculates upon how the course of history might have been altered if a particular historical event had an outcome different from the real life outcome
an alternate history requires three conditions a point of divergence from the historical record before the time in which the author is writing a change that would alter known history and an examination of the ramifications of that alteration to history
occasionally some types of genre fiction are misidentified as alternative history specifically science fiction stories set in a time that was the future for the writer but now is the past for the reader such as the novels by arthur c
clarke by george orwell and the movie because the authors did not alter the real history of the past when they wrote the stories
similar to the genre of alternative history there is also the genre of secret history which can be either fictional or non fictional which documents events that might have occurred in history but which had no effect upon the recorded historical outcome
alternative history also is thematically related to but distinct from counterfactual history which is a form of historiography that explores historical events in an extrapolated timeline in which key historical events either did not occur or had an outcome different from the historical record in order to understand what did happen
the earliest example of alternate history is found in livys ab urbe condita libri
livy contemplated an alternative th century bc in which alexander the great had survived to attack europe as he had planned asking what would have been the results for rome if she had been engaged in a war with alexander livy concluded that the romans would likely have defeated alexander
an even earlier possibility is herodotuss histories which contains speculative material
another example of counterfactual history was posited by cardinal and doctor of the church peter damian in the th century
in his famous work de divina omnipotentia a long letter in which he discusses gods omnipotence he treats questions related to the limits of divine power including the question of whether god can change the past for example bringing about that rome was never foundedi see i must respond finally to what many people on the basis of your holinesss judgment raise as an objection on the topic of this dispute
for they say if as you assert god is omnipotent in all things can he manage this that things that have been made were not made he can certainly destroy all things that have been made so that they do not exist now
but it cannot be seen how he can bring it about that things that have been made were not made
to be sure it can come about that from now on and hereafter rome does not exist for it can be destroyed
but no opinion can grasp how it can come about that it was not founded long ago
one early work of fiction detailing an alternate history is joanot martorells epic romance tirant lo blanch which was written when the fall of constantinople to the turks was still a recent and traumatic memory for christian europe
it tells the story of the knight tirant the white from brittany who travels to the embattled remnants of the byzantine empire
he becomes a megaduke and commander of its armies and manages to fight off the invading ottoman armies of
he saves the city from islamic conquest and even chases the turks deeper into lands they had previously conquered
one of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a large audience may be louis geoffroys histoire de la monarchie universelle napolon et la conqute du monde which imagines napoleons first french empire emerging victorious in the french invasion of russia in and in an invasion of england in later unifying the world under bonapartes rule
the book of mormon is described as an alternative history by richard lyman bushman a biographer of joseph smith
smith claimed to have translated the document from golden plates which told the story of a jewish group who migrated from israel to the americas and inhabited the region from about bc to ad becoming the ancestors of native americans
in the biography bushman wrote that the book of mormon turned american history upside down works on the premise that a history a book can reconstitute a nation
it assumes that by giving a nation an alternative history alternative values can be made to grow
in the english language the first known complete alternate history may be nathaniel hawthornes short story p
s correspondence published in
it recounts the tale of a man who is considered a madman due to his perceptions of a different a reality in which long dead famous people such as the poets robert burns lord byron percy bysshe shelley and john keats the actor edmund kean the british politician george canning and napoleon bonaparte are still alive
the first novel length alternate history in english would seem to be castello holfords aristopia
while not as nationalistic as louis geoffroys napolon et la conqute du monde aristopia is another attempt to portray a utopian society
in aristopia the earliest settlers in virginia discover a reef made of solid gold and are able to build a utopian society in north america
in h
wells published a modern utopia
as explicitly noted in the book itself wellss main aim in writing it was to set out his social and political ideas the plot serving mainly as a vehicle to expound them
this book introduced the idea of a person being transported from a point in our familiar world to the precise geographical equivalent point in an alternate world in which history had gone differently
the protagonists undergo various adventures in the alternate world and then are finally transported back to our world again to the precise geographical equivalent point
since then that has become a staple of the alternate history genre
a number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late th and early th centuries
in british historian sir john squire collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period for his anthology if it had happened otherwise
in that work scholars from major universities as well as important non academic authors turned their attention to such questions as if the moors in spain had won and if louis xvi had had an atom of firmness
the essays range from serious scholarly efforts to hendrik willem van loons fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent th century new amsterdam a dutch city state on the island of manhattan
among the authors included were hilaire belloc andr maurois and winston churchill
one of the entries in squires volume was churchills if lee had not won the battle of gettysburg written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world in which the confederacy had won the american civil war
the entry considers what would have happened if the north had been victorious
speculative work that narrates from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as recursive alternate history a double blind what if or an alternate alternate history
churchills essay was one of the influences behind ward moores alternate history novel bring the jubilee in which general robert e
lee won the battle of gettysburg and paved the way for the eventual victory of the confederacy in the american civil war
the protagonist the autodidact hodgins backmaker travels back to the aforementioned battle and inadvertently changes history which results in the emergence of our own timeline and the consequent victory of the union instead
the american humorist author james thurber parodied alternate history stories about the american civil war in his story if grant had been drinking at appomattox which he accompanied with this very brief introduction scribners magazine is publishing a series of three articles if booth had missed lincoln if lee had won the battle of gettysburg and if napoleon had escaped to america
this is the fourth
another example of alternate history from this period is hg wells men like gods in which the london based journalist mr barnstable along with two cars and their passengers is mysteriously teleported into another world which the earthlings call utopia
being far more advanced than earth utopia is some years ahead of humanity in its development
wells describes a multiverse of alternative worlds complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with american pulp writers
however since his hero experiences only a single alternate world the story is not very different from conventional alternate history
in the s alternate history moved into a new arena
the december issue of astounding published nat schachners ancestral voices which was quickly followed by murray leinsters sidewise in time
while earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences leinster attempted something completely different
in his world gone mad pieces of earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines
the story follows professor minott and his students from a fictitious robinson college as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history
sidewise in time has been described as the point at which the alternate history narrative first enters science fiction as a plot device and is the story for which the sidewise award for alternate history is named
a somewhat similar approach was taken by robert a
heinlein in his novelette elsewhen in which a professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines
he then hypnotizes his students so that they can explore more of them
eventually each settles into the reality that is most suitable for him or her
some of the worlds they visit are mundane some are very odd and others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions
world war ii produced alternate history for propaganda both british and american authors wrote works depicting nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales
the period around world war ii also saw the publication of the time travel novel lest darkness fall by l
sprague de camp in which an american academic travels to italy at the time of the byzantine invasion of the ostrogoths
de camps time traveler martin padway is depicted as making permanent historical changes and implicitly forming a new time branch thereby making the work an alternate history
in william tenns short story brooklyn project a tyrannical us government brushes aside the warnings of scientists about the dangers of time travel and goes on with a planned experiment with the result that minor changes to the prehistoric past cause humanity to never have existed its place taken by tentacled underwater intelligent creatures who also have a tyrannical government which also insists on experimenting with time travel
time travel as the cause of a point of divergence which can denote either the bifurcation of a historical timeline or a simple replacement of the future that existed before the time travelling event has continued to be a popular theme
in ward moores bring the jubilee the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the confederacy has won the american civil war
he travels backward through time and brings about a union victory at the battle of gettysburg
when a storys assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited times future rather than just the creation of an additional time line the device of a time patrol is often used where guardians move through time to preserve the correct history
a more recent example is making history by stephen fry in which a time machine is used to alter history so that adolf hitler was never born
that ironically results in a more competent leader of nazi germany and results in the countrys ascendancy and longevity in the altered timeline
while many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse the many world theory would naturally involve many worlds in fact a continually exploding array of universes
in quantum theory new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event and even if the writer uses human decisions every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline
a writers fictional multiverse may in fact preclude some decisions as humanly impossible as when in night watch terry pratchett depicts a character informing vimes that while anything that can happen has happened nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which vimes has ever murdered his wife
when the writer explicitly maintains that all possible decisions are made in all possible ways one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave nor clever nor skilled but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route take the stupid action fumble the crucial activity etc
few writers focus on this idea although it has been explored in stories such as larry nivens story all the myriad ways where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import
in any case even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred
the physicist david deutsch a strong advocate of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has argued along these lines saying that by making good choices doing the right thing we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives
when you succeed all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too
what you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen
this view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories but a few writers have tried such as greg egan in his short story the infinite assassin where an agent is trying to contain reality scrambling whirlpools that form around users of a certain drug and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves
many writers perhaps the majority avoid the discussion entirely
in one novel of this type h
beam pipers lord kalvan of otherwhen a pennsylvania state police officer who knows how to make gunpowder is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors
the paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it where the country will be overrun but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved
the cross time theme was further developed in the s by keith laumer in the first three volumes of his imperium sequence which would be completed in zone yellow
pipers politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by michael kurland and jack chalker in the s chalkers god inc trilogy featuring paratime detectives sam and brandy horowitz marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural
kurlands perchance the first volume of the never completed chronicles of elsewhen presents a multiverse of secretive cross time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross time travel ranging from high tech capsules to mutant powers
harry turtledove has launched the crosstime traffic series for teenagers featuring a variant of h
beam pipers paratime trading empire
the concept of a cross time version of a world war involving rival paratime empires was developed in fritz leibers change war series starting with the hugo award winning the big time followed by richard c
merediths timeliner trilogy in the s michael mccollums a greater infinity and john barnes timeline wars trilogy in the s
such paratime stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next providing a science fictional explanation or veneer for what is normally fantasy
aaron allstons doc sidhe and sidhe devil take place between our world the grim world and an alternate fair world where the sidhe retreated to
although technology is clearly present in both worlds and the fair world parallels our history about fifty years out of step there is functional magic in the fair world
even with such explanation the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world the more likely the story is to be labelled fantasy as in poul andersons house rule and losers night
in both science fiction and fantasy whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear
the writer might allude to a pod only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept or may present the universe without explanation of its existence
isaac asimovs short story what if is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television like device
this idea can also be found in asimovs novel the end of eternity in which the eternals can change the realities of the world without people being aware of it
poul andersons time patrol stories feature conflicts between forces intent on changing history and the patrol who work to preserve it
one story delenda est describes a world in which carthage triumphed over the roman republic
the big time by fritz leiber describes a change war ranging across all of history
keith laumers worlds of the imperium is one of the earliest alternate history novels it was published by fantastic stories of the imagination in in magazine form and reprinted by ace books in as one half of an ace double
besides our world laumer describes a world ruled by an imperial aristocracy formed by the merger of european empires in which the american revolution never happened and a third world in post war chaos ruled by the protagonists doppelganger
philip k
dicks novel the man in the high castle is an alternate history in which nazi germany and imperial japan won world war ii
this book contains an example of alternate alternate history in that one of its characters authored a book depicting a reality in which the allies won the war itself divergent from real world history in several aspects
the several characters live within a divided united states in which the empire of japan takes the pacific states governing them as a puppet nazi germany takes the east coast of the united states and parts of the midwest with the remnants of the old united states government as the neutral zone a buffer state between the two superpowers
the book has inspired an amazon series of the same name
vladimir nabokovs novel is a story of incest that takes place within an alternate north america settled in part by czarist russia and that borrows from dicks idea of alternate alternate history
some critics believe that the references to a counter earth suggest that the world portrayed in ada is a delusion in the mind of the hero
strikingly the characters in ada seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version calling it anti terra while its mythical twin is the real terra
like history science has followed a divergent path on anti terra it boasts all the same technology as our world but all based on water instead of electricity eg when a character in ada makes a long distance call all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power
guido morselli described the defeat of italy in world war i in his novel past conditional wherein the static alpine front line which divided italy from austria during that war collapses when the germans and the austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance
kingsley amis set his novel the alteration in the th century but major events in the reformation did not take place and protestantism is limited to the breakaway republic of new england
martin luther was reconciled to the roman catholic church and later became pope germanian i
in nick hancock and chris englands book what didnt happen next an alternative history of football it is suggested that had gordon banks been fit to play in the fifa world cup quarter final there would have been no thatcherism and the post war consensus would have continued indefinitely
kim stanley robinsons novel the years of rice and salt starts at the point of divergence with timur turning his army away from europe and the black death has killed of europes population instead of only a third
robinson explores world history from that point in ad to about ad
rather than following the great man theory of history focusing on leaders wars and major events robinson writes more about social history similar to the annales school of history theory and marxist historiography focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place
philip roths novel the plot against america looks at an america where franklin d
roosevelt is defeated in in his bid for a third term as president of the united states and charles lindbergh is elected leading to a us that features increasing fascism and anti semitism
michael chabon occasionally an author of speculative fiction contributed to the genre with his novel the yiddish policemens union which explores a world in which the state of israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the worlds jews instead live in a small strip of alaska set aside by the us government for jewish settlement
the story follows a jewish detective solving a murder case in the yiddish speaking semi autonomous city state of sitka
stylistically chabon borrows heavily from the noir and detective fiction genres while exploring social issues related to jewish history and culture
apart from the alternate history of the jews and israel chabon also plays with other common tropes of alternate history fiction in the book germany actually loses the war even harder than they did in reality getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing a ground war
the late s and the s saw a boom in popular fiction versions of alternate history fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author harry turtledove as well as the development of the steampunk genre and two series of anthologies the what might have been series edited by gregory benford and the alternate
series edited by mike resnick
this period also saw alternate history works by s
stirling kim stanley robinson harry harrison howard waldrop peter tieryas and others
in a sixteen part epic comic book series called captain confederacy began examining a world where the confederate states of america won the american civil war
in the series the captain and others heroes are staged government propaganda events featuring the feats of these superheroes
since the late s harry turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title master of alternate history by some
his books include those of timeline in which while the confederate states of america won the american civil war the union and imperial germany defeat the entente powers in the two great wars of the s and s and the worldwar series in which aliens invaded earth during world war ii
other stories by turtledove include a different flesh in which america was not colonized from asia during the last ice age in the presence of mine enemies in which the nazis won world war ii and ruled britannia in which the spanish armada succeeded in conquering england in the elizabethan era with william shakespeare being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the britons to rise up against their spanish conquerors
he also co authored a book with actor richard dreyfuss the two georges in which the united kingdom retained the american colonies with george washington and king george iii making peace
he did a two volume series in which the japanese not only bombed pearl harbor but also invaded and occupied the hawaiian islands
perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which the nazis won world war two
in some versions the nazis and or axis powers win or in others they conquer most of the world but a fortress america exists under siege while in others there is a nazi japanese cold war comparable to the us soviet equivalent in our timeline
fatherland by robert harris is set in europe following the nazi victory
the novel dominion by cj sansom is similar in concept but is set in england with churchill the leader of an anti german resistance and other historic persons in various fictional roles
in the mecha samurai empire series peter tieryas focuses on the asian american side of the alternate history exploring an america ruled by the japanese empire while integrating elements of asian pop culture like mechas and videogames
several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future
for instance james p
hogans the proteus operation
norman spinrad wrote the iron dream in which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by adolf hitler after fleeing from europe to north america in the s
in jo waltons small change series the united kingdom made peace with hitler before the involvement of the united states in world war ii and slowly collapses due to severe economic depression
former house speaker newt gingrich and william r
forstchen have written a novel in which the us defeated japan but not germany in world war ii resulting in a cold war with germany rather than the soviet union
gingrich and forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel instead they wrote a trilogy about the american civil war starting with in which the confederates win a victory at the battle of gettysburg however after lincoln responds by bringing grant and his forces to the eastern theater the army of northern virginia is soon trapped and destroyed in maryland and the war ends within weeks
while world war ii has been a common point of divergence in alternate history literature several works have been based on other points of divergence
for example martin cruz smith in his first novel posited an independent american indian nation following the defeat of custer in the indians won
beginning with the probability broach in l
neil smith wrote several novels that postulated the disintegration of the us federal government after albert gallatin joins the whiskey rebellion in and eventually leads to the creation of a libertarian utopia
in the novel poutine and gin by steve rhinelander the point of divergence is the battle of the plains of abraham of the french and indian war
that novel is a mystery set in of that time line
a recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches
these communities are transported from the present to the past or to another timeline via a natural disaster the action of technologically advanced aliens or a human experiment gone wrong
stirling wrote the island in the sea of time trilogy in which nantucket island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to bronze age times to become the worlds first superpower
in eric flints series a small town in west virginia is transported to th century central europe and drastically changes the course of the thirty years war which was then underway
john birminghams axis of time trilogy deals with the culture shock when a united nations naval task force from finds itself back in helping the allies against the empire of japan and the germans
the series also explores the cultural impacts of people with ideals interacting with s culture
similarly robert charles wilsons mysterium depicts a failed us government experiment which transports a small american town into an alternative version of the us run by believers in a form of christianity known as gnosticism who are engaged in a bitter war with the spanish in mexico
although not dealing in physical time travel in his alt history novel marx returns jason barker introduces anachronisms into the life and times of karl marx such as when his wife jenny sings a verse from the sex pistolss song anarchy in the uk or in the games of chess she plays with the marxes housekeeper helene demuth which on one occasion involves a caro kann defence
in her review of the novel nina power writes of jennys utopian desire for an end to time an attitude which according to power is inspired by her husbands co authored book the german ideology
however in keeping with the novels anachronisms the latter was not published until
by contrast the novels timeline ends in
in the novel hydrogen wars atomic sunrise by rm christianson a small change in post war japanese history leads to the election of general douglas macarthur as president of the united states
this minor change ultimately leads to all out atomic war between the major cold war powers
through crowdfunding on kickstarter alan jenkins and gan golan produced a graphic novel series called depicting a dystopian alternate reality in which the january united states capitol attack was successful
what follows is the burning down of the capitol building and the hanging of vice president mike pence
under donald trumps second term as president a solid gold statue of him is erected and armed thugs patrol the streets of washington dc suppressing civilian resistance with brutal violence under the banner of the confederate flag
many works of straight fantasy and science fantasy take place in historical settings though with the addition of for example magic or mythological beasts
some present a secret history in which the modern day world no longer believes that these elements ever existed
many ambiguous alternate secret histories are set in renaissance or pre renaissance times and may explicitly include a retreat from the world which would explain the current absence of such phenomena
other stories make plan a divergence of some kind
in poul andersons three hearts and three lions in which the matter of france is history and the fairy folk are real and powerful
the same authors a midsummer tempest occurs in a world in which the plays of william shakespeare presented the literal truth in every instance
the novel itself takes place in the era of oliver cromwell and charles i
here the english civil war had a different outcome and the industrial revolution has occurred early
randall garretts lord darcy series presents a point of divergence a monk systemizes magic rather than science so the use of foxglove to treat heart disease is regarded as superstition
another point of divergence occurs in when richard the lionheart survives the siege of chaluz and returns to england and makes the angevin empire so strong that it survives into the th century
jonathan strange mr norrell by susanna clarke takes place in an england where a separate kingdom ruled by the raven king and founded on magic existed in northumbria for over years
in patricia wredes regency fantasies great britain has a royal society of wizards
the tales of alvin maker series by orson scott card takes place in an alternate america beginning in the early th century
prior to that time a pod occurred england under the rule of oliver cromwell had banished makers or anyone else demonstrating knacks to the north american continent
thus the early american colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts and counted on them as a part of their daily lives
the political division of the continent is considerably altered with two large english colonies bookending a smaller american nation one aligned with england and the other governed by exiled cavaliers
actual historical figures are seen in a much different light ben franklin is revered as the continents finest maker george washington was executed after being captured and tom jefferson is the first president of appalachia the result of a compromise between the continentals and the british crown
on the other hand when the old ones still manifest themselves in england in keith robertss pavane which takes place in a technologically backward world after a spanish assassination of elizabeth i allowed the spanish armada to conquer england the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the pod possible the fairies really were present all along in a secret history
again in the english renaissance fantasy armor of light by melissa scott and lisa a
barnett the magic used in the book by dr john dee and others actually was practiced in the renaissance positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a point of departure
sir philip sidney survives the battle of zutphen in and shortly thereafter saving the life of christopher marlowe
when the magical version of our worlds history is set in contemporary times the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and contemporary fantasy using in effect a form of secret history on the other
in works such as robert a
heinleins magic incorporated where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and poul andersons operation chaos and its sequel operation luna where djinns are serious weapons of war with atomic bombs the use of magic throughout the united states and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history although references in operation chaos to degaussing the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a pod
the sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of einstein and planck in resulting in the theory of rhea tics
henry moseley applies this theory to degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces
this results in the suppression of ferromagnetism and the re emergence of magic and magical creatures
alternate history shades off into other fantasy subgenres when the use of actual though altered history and geography decreases although a culture may still be clearly the original source barry hugharts bridge of birds and its sequels take place in a fantasy world albeit one clearly based on china and with allusions to actual chinese history such as the empress wu
richard garfinkles celestial matters incorporates ancient chinese physics and greek aristotelian physics using them as if factual
alternate history has long been a staple of japanese speculative fiction with such authors as futaro yamada and ry hanmura writing novels set in recognizable historical settings with added supernatural or science fiction elements
ry hanmuras musubi no yama hiroku which recreated years of japans history from the perspective of a secret magical family with psychic abilities
the novel has since come to be recognized as a masterpiece of japanese speculative fiction
twelve years later author hiroshi aramata wrote the groundbreaking teito monogatari which reimagined the history of tokyo across the th century in a world heavily influenced by the supernatural
is set on a world where the iron curtain never fell and the cold war continues until the present
an englishmans castle tells the story of the writer of a soap opera in a s england which lost world war ii
england is run by a collaborator government which strains to maintain a normal appearance of british life
slowly however the writer begins to uncover the truth

fans of alternate history have made use of the internet from a very early point to showcase their own works and provide useful tools for those fans searching for anything alternate history first in mailing lists and usenet groups later in web databases and forums
the usenet alternate history list was first posted on april to the usenet newsgroup recartssf lovers
in may the dedicated newsgroup sochistorywhat if was created for showcasing and discussing alternate histories
its prominence declined with the general migration from unmoderated usenet to moderated web forums most prominently alternatehistorycom the self described largest gathering of alternate history fans on the internet with over active members
in addition to these discussion forums in was created as an online repository now containing over alternate history novels stories essays and other printed materials in several different languages
uchronia was selected as the sci fi channels sci fi site of the week twice
in spanish french german portuguese italian catalan and galician the words and are native versions of alternate history from which comes the english loanword uchronia
the english term uchronia is a neologism that is sometimes used in its original meaning as a straightforward synonym for alternate history
however it may also now refer to other concepts namely an umbrella genre of fiction that encompasses alternate history parallel universes in fiction and fiction based in futuristic or non temporal settings
in quantum mechanics an atomic orbital is a function describing the location and wave like behavior of an electron in an atom
this function describes the electrons charge distribution around the atoms nucleus and can be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron in a specific region around the nucleus
each orbital in an atom is characterized by a set of values of the three quantum numbers and which respectively correspond to the electrons energy its orbital angular momentum and its orbital angular momentum projected along a chosen axis
the orbitals with a well defined magnetic quantum number are generally complex valued
real valued orbitals can be formed as linear combinations of and orbitals and are often labeled using the associated harmonic polynomials which describe their angular structure
an orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons each with its own projection of spin formula
the simple names s orbital p orbital d orbital and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number and respectively
these names together with the value of are used to describe the electron configurations of atoms
they are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of alkali metal spectroscopic lines as and
orbitals for continue alphabetically omitting j because some languages do not distinguish between the letters i and j
atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter
in this model the electron cloud of an atom may be seen as being built up in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler hydrogen like atomic orbitals
the repeating periodicity of blocks of and elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s p d and f orbitals respectively though for higher values of quantum number particularly when the atom bears a positive charge the energies of certain sub shells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons can be rationalized only somewhat arbitrarily
with the development of quantum mechanics and experimental findings it was found that the electrons orbiting a nucleus could not be fully described as particles but needed to be explained by wave particle duality
in this sense electrons have the following properties thus electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles
an analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped atmosphere distributed around a relatively tiny planet
atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this atmosphere only when one electron is present
when more electrons are added the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing the electrons location because of the uncertainty principle
one should remember that these orbital states as described here are merely eigenstates of an electron in its orbit
an actual electron exists in a superposition of states which is like a weighted average but with complex number weights
so for instance an electron could be in a state a pure eigenstate or a mixed state or even the mixed state formula
for each eigenstate a property has an eigenvalue
so for the three states just mentioned the value of formula is and the value of formula is
but the value for formula is a superposition of and
it is not a fraction like it is ambiguous either or a superposition of eigenstates and would have an ambiguous formula and formula but formula would definitely be
eigenstates make it easier to deal with the math
you can choose a different basis of eigenstates by superimposing eigenstates from any other basis
atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal quantum mechanical language
they are approximate solutions to the schrdinger equation for the electrons bound to the atom by the electric field of the atoms nucleus
specifically in quantum mechanics the state of an atom ie an eigenstate of the atomic hamiltonian is approximated by an expansion into linear combinations of anti symmetrized products of one electron functions
the spatial components of these one electron functions are called atomic orbitals
a state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons so that their motion is correlated but this is often approximated by this independent particle model of products of single electron wave functions
in atomic physics the atomic spectral lines correspond to transitions between quantum states of an atom
these states are labeled by a set of quantum numbers summarized in the term symbol and usually associated with particular electron configurations ie by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals
this notation means that the corresponding slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion
the atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition
for example one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital
nevertheless one has to keep in mind that electrons are fermions ruled by the pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from each other
moreover it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one determinant wave function at all
this is the case when electron correlation is large
fundamentally an atomic orbital is a one electron wave function even though many electrons are not in one electron atoms and so the one electron view is an approximation
when thinking about orbitals we are often given an orbital visualization heavily influenced by the hartree fock approximation which is one way to reduce the complexities of molecular orbital theory
atomic orbitals can be the hydrogen like orbitals which are exact solutions to the schrdinger equation for a hydrogen like atom
alternatively atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule
the coordinate systems chosen for orbitals are usually spherical coordinates in atoms and cartesian in polyatomic molecules
the advantage of spherical coordinates here is that an orbital wave function is a product of three factors each dependent on a single coordinate
the angular factors of atomic orbitals generate s p d etc
functions as real combinations of spherical harmonics
there are typically three mathematical forms for the radial functions which can be chosen as a starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules with many electrons although hydrogen like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools the advent of computers has made stos preferable for atoms and diatomic molecules since combinations of stos can replace the nodes in hydrogen like orbitals
gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms
although not as accurate by themselves as stos combinations of many gaussians can attain the accuracy of hydrogen like orbitals
the term orbital was coined by robert s
mulliken in as short for one electron orbital wave function
niels bohr explained around that electrons might revolve around a compact nucleus with definite angular momentum
bohrs model was an improvement on the explanations of ernest rutherford that of the electron moving around a nucleus
japanese physicist hantaro nagaoka published an orbit based hypothesis for electron behavior as early as
these theories were each built upon new observations starting with simple understanding and becoming more correct and complex
explaining the behavior of these electron orbits was one of the driving forces behind the development of quantum mechanics
with j
thomsons discovery of the electron in it became clear that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature but were rather composite particles
the newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atoms constituent parts might interact with each other
thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolve in orbit like rings within a positively charged jelly like substance and between the electrons discovery and this plum pudding model was the most widely accepted explanation of atomic structure
shortly after thomsons discovery hantaro nagaoka predicted a different model for electronic structure
unlike the plum pudding model the positive charge in nagaokas saturnian model was concentrated into a central core pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of saturns rings
few people took notice of nagaokas work at the time and nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation
nevertheless the saturnian model turned out to have more in common with modern theory than any of its contemporaries
in ernest rutherford discovered that the bulk of the atomic mass was tightly condensed into a nucleus which was also found to be positively charged
it became clear from his analysis in that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure
in rutherfords post doctoral student niels bohr proposed a new model of the atom wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods but were permitted to have only discrete values of angular momentum quantized in units
this constraint automatically allowed only certain electron energies
the bohr model of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines
after bohrs use of einsteins explanation of the photoelectric effect to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the emission and absorption spectra of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms
the most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines
the significance of the bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom
this was however not achieved by bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave like properties since the idea that electrons could behave as matter waves was not suggested until eleven years later
still the bohr models use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step toward the understanding of electrons in atoms and also a significant step towards the development of quantum mechanics in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms
with de broglies suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in and for a short time before the full schrdinger equation treatment of hydrogen like atoms a bohr electron wavelength could be seen to be a function of its momentum so a bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half wavelength
the bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the wavelength argument
however this period was immediately superseded by the full three dimensional wave mechanics of
in our current understanding of physics the bohr model is called a semi classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the bohr model was proposed
the bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of hydrogen
the energies of electrons in the n etc
states in the bohr model match those of current physics
however this did not explain similarities between different atoms as expressed by the periodic table such as the fact that helium neon and argon exhibit similar chemical inertness
modern quantum mechanics explains this in terms of electron shells and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the pauli exclusion principle
thus the n state can hold one or two electrons while the n state can hold up to eight electrons in s and p subshells
in helium all n states are fully occupied the same is true for n and n in neon
in argon the s and p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons quantum mechanics also allows a d subshell but this is at higher energy than the s and p in argon and remains empty
immediately after heisenberg discovered his uncertainty principle bohr noted that the existence of any sort of wave packet implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself
in quantum mechanics where all particle momenta are associated with waves it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave and thus the particle in space
in states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound it must be localized as a wave packet and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength and thus also momentum and energy
in quantum mechanics as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta and thus larger kinetic energy
thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller
particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space since this would require infinite particle momentum
in chemistry erwin schrdinger linus pauling mulliken and others noted that the consequence of heisenbergs relation was that the electron as a wave packet could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital
max born suggested that the electrons position needed to be described by a probability distribution which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave function which described its associated wave packet
the new quantum mechanics did not give exact results but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results
heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it as we cannot with electrons in an atom
in the quantum picture of heisenberg schrdinger and others the bohr atom number n for each orbital became known as an n sphere in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the most probable energy of the probability cloud of the electrons wave packet which surrounded the atom
where x is the energy level corresponding to the principal quantum number type is a lower case letter denoting the shape or subshell of the orbital corresponding to the angular momentum quantum number
for example the orbital s is the lowest energy level and has an angular quantum number of denoted as s
orbitals with are denoted as p d and f respectively
the set of orbitals for a given n and is called a subshell denoted the superscript y shows the number of electrons in the subshell
for example the notation p indicates that the p subshell of an atom contains electrons
this subshell has orbitals each with n and
there is also another less common system still used in x ray science known as x ray notation which is a continuation of the notations used before orbital theory was well understood
in this system the principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it
for the letters associated with those numbers are k l m n o
the simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a single electron such as the hydrogen atom
an atom of any other element ionized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen and the orbitals take the same form
in the schrdinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator for the energy
they can be obtained analytically meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series and exponential and trigonometric functions
for atoms with two or more electrons the governing equations can be solved only with the use of methods of iterative approximation
orbitals of multi electron atoms are qualitatively similar to those of hydrogen and in the simplest models they are taken to have the same form
for more rigorous and precise analysis numerical approximations must be used
a given atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers and
the rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers and their energies explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the periodic table
the stationary states of the hydrogen like atoms are its atomic orbitals
however in general an electrons behavior is not fully described by a single orbital
electron states are best represented by time depending mixtures of multiple orbitals
see linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method
the quantum number first appeared in the bohr model where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit
in modern quantum mechanics however determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus all electrons with the same value of n lie at the same average distance
for this reason orbitals with the same value of n are said to comprise a shell
orbitals with the same value of n and also the same value of are even more closely related and are said to comprise a subshell
because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum numbers
these quantum numbers occur only in certain combinations of values and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed
in physics the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic
the quantum numbers together with the rules governing their possible values are as follows the principal quantum number describes the energy of the electron and is always a positive integer
in fact it can be any positive integer but for reasons discussed below large numbers are seldom encountered
each atom has in general many orbitals associated with each value of n these orbitals together are sometimes called electron shells
the azimuthal quantum number describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non negative integer
within a shell where is some integer ranges across all values satisfying the relation formula
for instance the shell has only orbitals with formula and the shell has only orbitals with formula and formula
the set of orbitals associated with a particular value of are sometimes collectively called a subshell
the magnetic quantum number formula describes the projection of the orbital angular momentum along a chosen axis
it determines the magnitude of the current circulating around that axis and the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment of an electron via the amprian loop model
within a subshell formula formula obtains the integer values in the range formula
the above results may be summarized in the following table
each cell represents a subshell and lists the values of formula available in that subshell
empty cells represent subshells that do not exist
subshells are usually identified by their formula and formula values
formula is represented by its numerical value but formula is represented by a letter as follows is represented by s by p by d by f and by g
for instance one may speak of the subshell with formula and formula as a s subshell
each electron also has angular momentum in the form of quantum mechanical spin given by spin s
its projection along a specified axis is given by the spin magnetic quantum number ms which can be or
these values are also called spin up or spin down respectively
the pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers
if there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers these two electrons must differ in their spin projection ms
the above conventions imply a preferred axis and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis
otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing from
as such the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries
the stern gerlach experimentwhere an atom is exposed to a magnetic fieldprovides one such example
instead of the complex orbitals described above it is common especially in the chemistry literature to use real atomic orbitals
these real orbitals arise from simple linear combinations of complex orbitals
using the condon shortley phase convention real orbitals are related to complex orbitals in the same way that the real spherical harmonics are related to complex spherical harmonics
letting formula denote a complex orbital with quantum numbers formula formula and formula the real orbitals formula may be defined by formula if formula with formula the radial part of the orbital this definition is equivalent to formula where formula is the real spherical harmonic related to either the real or imaginary part of the complex spherical harmonic formula
real spherical harmonics are physically relevant when an atom is embedded in a crystalline solid in which case there are multiple preferred symmetry axes but no single preferred direction
real atomic orbitals are also more frequently encountered in introductory chemistry textbooks and shown in common orbital visualizations
in real hydrogen like orbitals quantum numbers formula and formula have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts but formula is no longer a good quantum number
some real orbitals are given specific names beyond the simple formula designation
orbitals with quantum number formula equal to formula are called formula orbitals
with this one can already assign names to complex orbitals such as formula the first symbol is the formula quantum number the second character is the symbol for that particular formula quantum number and the subscript is the formula quantum number
as an example of how the full orbital names are generated for real orbitals one may calculate formula
from the table of spherical harmonics formula with formula
then likewise formula
as a more complicated example in all these cases we generate a cartesian label for the orbital by examining and abbreviating the polynomial in formula formula and formula appearing in the numerator
we ignore any terms in the formula polynomial except for the term with the highest exponent in formula
we then use the abbreviated polynomial as a subscript label for the atomic state using the same nomenclature as above to indicate the formula and formula quantum numbers
the expression above all use the condon shortley phase convention which is favored by quantum physicists
other conventions exist for the phase of the spherical harmonics
under these different conventions the formula and formula orbitals may appear for example as the sum and difference of formula and formula contrary to what is shown above
below is a list of these cartesian polynomial names for the atomic orbitals
there does not seem to be reference in the literature as to how to abbreviate the long cartesian spherical harmonic polynomials for formula so there does not seem be consensus on the naming of formula orbitals or higher according to this nomenclature
simple pictures showing orbital shapes are intended to describe the angular forms of regions in space where the electrons occupying the orbital are likely to be found
the diagrams cannot show the entire region where an electron can be found since according to quantum mechanics there is a non zero probability of finding the electron anywhere in space
instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or contour surfaces where the probability density has a constant value chosen so that there is a certain probability of finding the electron within the contour
although as the square of an absolute value is everywhere non negative the sign of the wave function is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture
sometimes the function is graphed to show its phases rather than which shows probability density but has no phase
orbital graphs tend to have less spherical thinner lobes than graphs but have the same number of lobes in the same places and otherwise are recognizable
this article to show wave function phase shows mostly graphs
the lobes can be seen as standing wave interference patterns between the two counter rotating ring resonant traveling wave and modes the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane has a resonant wavelength around the circumference
although rarely shown the traveling wave solutions can be seen as rotating banded tori the bands represent phase information
for each there are two standing wave solutions and
if the orbital is vertical counter rotating information is unknown and the orbital is z axis symmetric
if there are no counter rotating modes
there are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric
nodal planes and nodal spheres are surfaces on which the probability density vanishes
the number of nodal surfaces is controlled by the quantum numbers and
an orbital with azimuthal quantum number has radial nodal planes passing through the origin
for example the s orbitals are spherically symmetric and have no nodal planes whereas the p orbitals have a single nodal plane between the lobes
the number of nodal spheres equals consistent with the restriction on the quantum numbers
the principal quantum number controls the total number of nodal surfaces which is
loosely speaking is energy is analogous to eccentricity and is orientation
in general determines size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus as increases the size of the orbital increases
the higher nuclear charge of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones so that the size of the atom remains very roughly constant even as the number of electrons increases
also in general terms determines an orbitals shape and its orientation
however since some orbitals are described by equations in complex numbers the shape sometimes depends on also
together the whole set of orbitals for a given and fill space as symmetrically as possible though with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes
the single s orbitals are shaped like spheres
for it is roughly a solid ball but for each single s orbital is made of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells
see illustration of a cross section of these nested shells at right
the s orbitals for all numbers are the only orbitals with an anti node at the center of the nucleus
all other orbitals have angular momentum and thus avoid the nucleus
recently there has been an effort to experimentally image the s and p orbitals in a srtio crystal using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy
because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam coulombic beam orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the outcome
the shapes of p d and f orbitals are described verbally here and shown graphically in the orbitals table below
the three p orbitals for have the form of two ellipsoids with a point of tangency at the nucleus
the three p orbitals in each shell are oriented at right angles to each other as determined by their respective linear combination of values of
the overall result is a lobe pointing along each direction of the primary axes
four of the five d orbitals for look similar each with four pear shaped lobes each lobe tangent at right angles to two others and the centers of all four lying in one plane
three of these planes are the xy xz and yz planes the lobes are between the pairs of primary axes and the fourth has the center along the x and y axes themselves
the fifth and final d orbital consists of three regions of high probability density a torus in between two pear shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis
the overall total of directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair
there are seven f orbitals each with shapes more complex than those of the d orbitals
additionally as is the case with the s orbitals individual p d f and g orbitals with values higher than the lowest possible value exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type as compared with the lowest mode of the wave
as with s orbitals this phenomenon provides p d f and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of an additional node in each lobe
still higher values of further increase the number of radial nodes for each type of orbital
the shapes of atomic orbitals in one electron atom are related to dimensional spherical harmonics
these shapes are not unique and any linear combination is valid like a transformation to cubic harmonics in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the ds are the same shape just like the and are the same shape
although individual orbitals are most often shown independent of each other the orbitals coexist around the nucleus at the same time
also in albrecht unsld proved that if one sums the electron density of all orbitals of a particular azimuthal quantum number of the same shell where each orbital is occupied by an electron or each is occupied by an electron pair then all angular dependence disappears that is the resulting total density of all the atomic orbitals in that subshell is spherical
this is known as unslds theorem
this table shows the real hydrogen like wave functions for all atomic orbitals up to s and therefore covers the occupied orbitals in the ground state of all elements in the periodic table up to radium and some beyond
graphs are shown with and wave function phases shown in two different colors
the orbital is the same as the orbital but the and are formed by taking linear combinations of the and orbitals
also the and are not the same shape as the since they are pure spherical harmonics
elements with p electrons have been discovered but their electronic configurations are only predicted
for the elements whose highest occupied orbital is a d orbital only some electronic configurations have been confirmed
these are the real valued orbitals commonly used in chemistry
only the formula orbitals where are eigenstates of the orbital angular momentum operator formula
the columns with formula are combinations of two eigenstates
see comparison in the following picture the shapes of atomic orbitals can be qualitatively understood by considering the analogous case of standing waves on a circular drum
to see the analogy the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles must be considered relative to that points distance from the center of the drum head
if this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals
the basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be
that is the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electrons average momentum at that point since high electron momentum at a given position tends to localize the electron in that position via the properties of electron wave packets
this relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals
for example in all of the modes analogous to s orbitals it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly corresponding to the antinode in all s orbitals in an atom
this antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus since it is moving most rapidly at that point giving it maximal momentum
a mental planetary orbit picture closest to the behavior of electrons in s orbitals all of which have no angular momentum might perhaps be that of a keplerian orbit with the orbital eccentricity of but a finite major axis not physically possible but can be imagined as a limit of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity
below a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave functions of the hydrogen atom are shown
a correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two coordinate system and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three coordinate
none of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode and in all of them the center of the drum does not move
these correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non s orbitals in an atom
these orbitals all have some angular momentum and in the planetary model they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body but keep somewhat away from it
in addition the drum modes analogous to p and d modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum whereas all of the modes analogous to s modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction
the non radial symmetry properties of non s orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum
for these modes waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point
such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons
in atoms with one electron the energy of an orbital is determined mainly by formula
the formula orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom
each successively higher value of formula has a higher energy but the difference decreases as formula increases
for high formula the energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape the atom
in single electron atoms all levels with different formula within a given formula are degenerate in the schrdinger approximation and have the same energy
this approximation is broken slightly in the solution to the dirac equation and by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and quantum electrodynamics effects
the latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for s electrons that go nearer the nucleus since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge even in one electron atoms see lamb shift
in atoms with multiple electrons the energy of an electron depends not only on its orbital but also on its interactions with other electrons
these interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution and so the energy levels of orbitals depend not only on formula but also on formula
higher values of formula are associated with higher values of energy for instance the p state is higher than the s state
when formula the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the s orbital in the next higher shell when formula the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher
the filling of the d orbitals does not occur until the s orbitals have been filled
the increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron electron interaction effects and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons
thus in atoms with higher atomic number the formula of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy and the principal quantum numbers formula of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement
the energy sequence of the first subshells is given in the following table
each cell represents a subshell with formula and formula given by its row and column indices respectively
the number in the cell is the subshells position in the sequence
for a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms see the section below
note empty cells indicate non existent sublevels while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could exist but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known
several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals
the first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers
these quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals as well as the spin magnetic quantum number
thus two electrons may occupy a single orbital so long as they have different values of
because takes one of only two values at most two electrons can occupy each orbital
additionally an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state
it is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the pauli exclusion principle but if lower energy orbitals are available this condition is unstable
the electron will eventually lose energy and drop into the lower orbital
thus electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above
this behavior is responsible for the structure of the periodic table
the table may be divided into several rows numbered starting with at the top
the presently known elements occupy seven periods
if a certain period has number i it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the ith shell
niels bohr was the first to propose that the periodicity in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels resulting in the electronic structure of the atom
the periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular blocks
the elements belonging to a given block have this common feature their highest energy electrons all belong to the same state
for instance the leftmost two columns constitute the s block
the outermost electrons of li and be respectively belong to the s subshell and those of na and mg to the s subshell
the periodic nature of the filling of orbitals as well as emergence of the s p d and f blocks is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows in the matrix
then each subshell is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain
the result is a compressed periodic table with each entry representing two successive elements although this is the general order of orbital filling according to the madelung rule there are exceptions and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms
the number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the atomic number
the electrons in the outermost shell or valence electrons tend to be responsible for an elements chemical behavior
elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties
for elements with high atomic number the effects of relativity become more pronounced and especially so for s electrons which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high atoms
this relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of s orbitals relative to d orbitals this results in s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy
examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of mercury and the golden color of gold and caesium
in the bohr model an electron has a velocity given by formula where is the atomic number formula is the fine structure constant and is the speed of light
in non relativistic quantum mechanics therefore any atom with an atomic number greater than would require its s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light
even in the dirac equation which accounts for relativistic effects the wave function of the electron for atoms with formula is oscillatory and unbounded
the significance of element also known as untriseptium was first pointed out by the physicist richard feynman
element is sometimes informally called feynmanium
however feynmans approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of due to the non point charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than
the critical value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron positron pairs does not occur until is about
these conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators where such electron positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed
there are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities although individual components of the wave function will have nodes
in late period elements a hybrid of p and p is expected to exist where and refer to the total angular momentum quantum number
this pp hybrid may be responsible for the p block of the period due to properties similar to p subshells in ordinary valence shells
energy levels of p and p come close due to relativistic spin orbit effects the s subshell should also participate as these elements are expected to be analogous to the respective p elements indium through xenon
bound quantum states have discrete energy levels
when applied to atomic orbitals this means that the energy differences between states are also discrete
a transition between these states can thus happen only if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states
by quantum theory state has a fixed energy of and state has a fixed energy of
now what would happen if an electron in state were to move to state for this to happen the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly
if the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value it cannot jump from state to state
now suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad spectrum of light
photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly will be absorbed by the electron in state and that electron will jump to state
however photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron because the electron can jump only to one of the orbitals it cannot jump to a state between orbitals
the result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom
this creates a line in the spectrum known as an absorption line which corresponds to the energy difference between states and
the atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra which are observed experimentally
this is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model
the atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory which only recognizes many electron states
the predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron
amino acids are organic compounds that contain both amino and carboxylic acid functional groups
although over amino acids exist in nature by far the most important are the amino acids incorporated into proteins
only these appear in the genetic code of life
amino acids can be classified according to the locations of the core structural functional groups beta gamma amino acids etc
other categories relate to polarity ionization and side chain group type
in the form of proteins amino acid residues form the second largest component of human muscles and other tissues
beyond their role as residues in proteins amino acids participate in a number of processes such as neurotransmitter transport and biosynthesis
it is thought that they played a key role in enabling life on earth and its emergence
amino acids are formally named by the iupac iubmb joint commission on biochemical nomenclature in terms of the fictitious neutral structure shown in the illustration
for example the systematic name of alanine is aminopropanoic acid based on the formula
the commission justified this approach as follows the systematic names and formulas given refer to hypothetical forms in which amino groups are unprotonated and carboxyl groups are undissociated
this convention is useful to avoid various nomenclatural problems but should not be taken to imply that these structures represent an appreciable fraction of the amino acid molecules
the first few amino acids were discovered in the early s
in french chemists louis nicolas vauquelin and pierre jean robiquet isolated a compound from asparagus that was subsequently named asparagine the first amino acid to be discovered
cystine was discovered in although its monomer cysteine remained undiscovered until
glycine and leucine were discovered in
the last of the common amino acids to be discovered was threonine in by william cumming rose who also determined the essential amino acids and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth
the unity of the chemical category was recognized by wurtz in but he gave no particular name to it
the first use of the term amino acid in the english language dates from while the german term was used earlier
proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid hydrolysis
in emil fischer and franz hofmeister independently proposed that proteins are formed from many amino acids whereby bonds are formed between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another resulting in a linear structure that fischer termed peptide
alpha or amino acids have the generic formula in most cases where r is an organic substituent known as a side chain
of the many hundreds of described amino acids are proteinogenic
it is these compounds that combine to give a vast array of peptides and proteins assembled by ribosomes
non proteinogenic or modified amino acids may arise from post translational modification or during nonribosomal peptide synthesis
the carbon atom next to the carboxyl group is called the carbon
in proteinogenic amino acids it bears the amine and the r group or side chain specific to each amino acid
with four distinct substituents the carbon is stereogenic in all amino acids except glycine
all chiral proteogenic amino acids have the l configuration
they are left handed enantiomers which refers to the stereoisomers of the alpha carbon
a few d amino acids have been found in nature eg in bacterial envelopes as a neuromodulator and in some antibiotics
rarely d amino acid residues are found in proteins and are converted from the l amino acid as a post translational modification
five amino acids possess a charge at neutral ph
often these side chains appear at the surfaces on proteins to enable their solubility in water and side chains with opposite charges form important electrostatic contacts called salt bridges that maintain structures within a single protein or between interfacing proteins
many proteins bind metal into their structures specifically and these interactions are commonly mediated by charged side chains such as aspartate glutamate and histidine
under certain conditions each ion forming group can be charged forming double salts
the two negatively charged amino acids at neutral ph are aspartate and glutamate
the anionic carboxylate groups behave as brnsted bases in most circumstances
enzymes in very low ph environments like the aspartic protease pepsin in mammalian stomachs may have catalytic aspartate or glutamate residues that act as brnsted acids
there are three amino acids with side chains that are cations at neutral ph arginine lysine and histidine
arginine has a charged guanidino group and lysine a charged alkyl amino group and are fully protonated at ph
histidines imidazole group has a pka of and is only around protonated at neutral ph
because histidine is easily found in its basic and conjugate acid forms it often participates in catalytic proton transfers in enzyme reactions
the polar uncharged amino acids serine threonine asparagine and glutamine readily form hydrogen bonds with water and other amino acids
they do not ionize in normal conditions a prominent exception being the catalytic serine in serine proteases
this is an example of severe perturbation and is not characteristic of serine residues in general
threonine has two chiral centers not only the l chiral center at the carbon shared by all amino acids apart from achiral glycine but also at the carbon
the full stereochemical specification is l threonine
nonpolar amino acid interactions are the primary driving force behind the processes that fold proteins into their functional three dimensional structures
none of these amino acids side chains ionize easily and therefore do not have pkas with the exception of tyrosine
the hydroxyl of tyrosine can deprotonate at high ph forming the negatively charged phenolate
because of this one could place tyrosine into the polar uncharged amino acid category but its very low solubility in water matches the characteristics of hydrophobic amino acids well
several side chains are not described well by the charged polar and hydrophobic categories
glycine could be considered a polar amino acid since its small size means that its solubility is largely determined by the amino and carboxylate groups
however the lack of any side chain provides glycine with a unique flexibility among amino acids with large ramifications to protein folding
cysteine can also form hydrogen bonds readily which would place it in the polar amino acid category though it can often be found in protein structures forming covalent bonds called disulphide bonds with other cysteines
these bonds influence the folding and stability of proteins and are essential in the formation of antibodies
proline has an alkyl side chain and could be considered hydrophobic but because the side chain joins back onto the alpha amino group it becomes particularly inflexible when incorporated into proteins
similar to glycine this influences protein structure in a way unique among amino acids
selenocysteine is a rare amino acid not directly encoded by dna but is incorporated into proteins via the ribosome
selenocysteine has a lower redox potential compared to the similar cysteine and participates in several unique enzymatic reactions
pyrrolysine is another amino acid not encoded in dna but synthesized into protein by ribosomes
it is found in archaeal species where it participates in the catalytic activity of several methyltransferases
amino acids with the structure such as alanine a component of carnosine and a few other peptides are amino acids
ones with the structure are amino acids and so on where x and y are two substituents
the common natural forms of amino acids have a zwitterionic structure with and functional groups attached to the same c atom and are thus amino acids and are the only ones found in proteins during translation in the ribosome
in aqueous solution at ph close to neutrality amino acids exist as zwitterions ie as dipolar ions with both and in charged states so the overall structure is
at physiological ph the so called neutral forms are not present to any measurable degree
although the two charges in the zwitterion structure add up to zero it is misleading to call a species with a net charge of zero uncharged
in strongly acidic conditions the carboxylate group becomes protonated and the structure becomes an ammonio carboxylic acid
this is relevant for enzymes like pepsin that are active in acidic environments such as the mammalian stomach and lysosomes but does not significantly apply to intracellular enzymes
in highly basic conditions the ammonio group is deprotonated to give
although various definitions of acids and bases are used in chemistry the only one that is useful for chemistry in aqueous solution is that of brnsted an acid is a species that can donate a proton to another species and a base is one that can accept a proton
this criterion is used to label the groups in the above illustration
the carboxylate side chains of aspartate and glutamate residues are the principal brnsted bases in proteins
likewise lysine tyrosine and cysteine will typically act as a brnsted acid
histidine under these conditions can act both as a brnsted acid and a base
for amino acids with uncharged side chains the zwitterion predominates at ph values between the two pka values but coexists in equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions
at the midpoint between the two pka values the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions balance so that average net charge of all forms present is zero
this ph is known as the isoelectric point pi so pi
for amino acids with charged side chains the pka of the side chain is involved
thus for aspartate or glutamate with negative side chains the terminal amino group is essentially entirely in the charged form but this positive charge needs to be balanced by the state with just one c terminal carboxylate group is negatively charged
this occurs halfway between the two carboxylate pka values pi where pka is the side chain pka
similar considerations apply to other amino acids with ionizable side chains including not only glutamate but also cysteine histidine lysine tyrosine and arginine with positive side chains
amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids
zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the ph to the required isoelectric point
the canonical amino acids can be classified according to their properties
important factors are charge hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity size and functional groups
these properties influence protein structure and protein protein interactions
the water soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues buried in the middle of the protein whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent
the integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them in the lipid bilayer
some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that sticks to the membrane
in a similar fashion proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich in negatively charged amino acids such as glutamate and aspartate while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich in positively charged amino acids like lysine and arginine
for example lysine and arginine are present in large amounts in the low complexity regions of nucleic acid binding proteins
there are various hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues
some amino acids have special properties
cysteine can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues
proline forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone and glycine is more flexible than other amino acids
glycine and proline are strongly present within low complexity regions of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins whereas the opposite is the case with cysteine phenylalanine tryptophan methionine valine leucine isoleucine which are highly reactive or complex or hydrophobic
many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications whereby additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acid residue side chains sometimes producing lipoproteins or glycoproteins allowing the protein to attach temporarily to a membrane
for example a signaling protein can attach and then detach from a cell membrane because it contains cysteine residues that can have the fatty acid palmitic acid added to them and subsequently removed
although one letter symbols are included in the table iupac iubmb recommend that use of the one letter symbols should be restricted to the comparison of long sequences
in addition to the specific amino acid codes placeholders are used in cases where chemical or crystallographic analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine the identity of a residue
they are also used to summarize conserved protein sequence motifs
the use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of abbreviation codes for degenerate bases
unk is sometimes used instead of xaa but is less standard
ter or is used in notation for mutations in proteins when a stop codon occurs
it corresponds to no amino acid at all
in addition many nonstandard amino acids have a specific code
for example several peptide drugs such as bortezomib and mg are artificially synthesized and retain their protecting groups which have specific codes
bortezomib is pyz phe boroleu and mg is z leu leu leu al
to aid in the analysis of protein structure photo reactive amino acid analogs are available
these include photoleucine and photomethionine
amino acids are the precursors to proteins
they join by condensation reactions to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins
these chains are linear and unbranched with each amino acid residue within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids
in nature the process of making proteins encoded by rna genetic material is called translation and involves the step by step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome
the order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mrna template which is an rna derived from one of the organisms genes
twenty two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids
of these are encoded by the universal genetic code
the remaining selenocysteine and pyrrolysine are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms
selenocysteine is incorporated when the mrna being translated includes a secis element which causes the uga codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon
pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane
it is coded for with the codon uag which is normally a stop codon in other organisms
several independent evolutionary studies have suggested that gly ala asp val ser pro glu leu thr may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted the early genetic code whereas cys met tyr trp his phe may belong to a group of amino acids that constituted later additions of the genetic code
the amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids
a modified form of methionine is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria mitochondria and plastids
other amino acids are called nonstandard or non canonical
most of the nonstandard amino acids are also non proteinogenic but two of them are proteinogenic as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code
the two nonstandard proteinogenic amino acids are selenocysteine and pyrrolysine
the incorporation of these nonstandard amino acids is rare
for example human proteins include selenocysteine in their primary structure and the structurally characterized enzymes employ selenocysteine as the catalytic moiety in their active sites
pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons
for example selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and secis element
n formylmethionine is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid
codon trna combinations not found in nature can also be used to expand the genetic code and form novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non proteinogenic amino acids
aside from the proteinogenic amino acids many non proteinogenic amino acids are known
those either are not found in proteins or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery
for example hydroxyproline is synthesised from proline
another example is selenomethionine
non proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by post translational modification
such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein eg the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane
examples some non proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins
examples include aminoisobutyric acid and the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid
non proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids for example ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle part of amino acid catabolism
a rare exception to the dominance of amino acids in biology is the amino acid beta alanine which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid a component of coenzyme a
amino acids are not typical component of food animals eat proteins
the protein is broken down into amino acids in the process of digestion
they are then used to synthesize new proteins other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy
the oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle
the other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle
glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis
of the standard amino acids nine are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth so they must be obtained from food
in addition cysteine tyrosine and arginine are considered semiessential amino acids and taurine a semi essential aminosulfonic acid in children
some amino acids are conditionally essential for certain ages or medical conditions
essential amino acids may also vary from species to species
the metabolic pathways that synthesize these monomers are not fully developed
many proteinogenic and non proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions beyond being precursors to proteins and peptidesin humans amino acids also have important roles in diverse biosynthetic pathways
defenses against herbivores in plants sometimes employ amino acids
examples amino acids are sometimes added to animal feed because some of the components of these feeds such as soybeans have low levels of some of the essential amino acids especially of lysine methionine threonine and tryptophan
likewise amino acids are used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from feed supplements
the food industry is a major consumer of amino acids especially glutamic acid which is used as a flavor enhancer and aspartame which is used as an artificial sweetener
amino acids are sometimes added to food by manufacturers to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies such as anemia by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation
amino acids are low cost feedstocks used in chiral pool synthesis as enantiomerically pure building blocks
amino acids are used in the synthesis of some cosmetics
the chelating ability of amino acids is sometimes used in fertilizers to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies such as iron chlorosis
these fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and to improve the overall health of the plants
amino acids have been considered as components of biodegradable polymers which have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants
an interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate a water soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture
due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradable antiscaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor
the commercial production of amino acids usually relies on mutant bacteria that overproduce individual amino acids using glucose as a carbon source
some amino acids are produced by enzymatic conversions of synthetic intermediates
aminothiazoline carboxylic acid is an intermediate in one industrial synthesis of l cysteine for example
aspartic acid is produced by the addition of ammonia to fumarate using a lyase
in plants nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate formed from alpha ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion
for other amino acids plants use transaminases to move the amino group from glutamate to another alpha keto acid
for example aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha ketoglutarate and aspartate
other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis too
nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids
for example homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite s adenosylmethionine while hydroxyproline is made by a post translational modification of proline
microorganisms and plants synthesize many uncommon amino acids
for example some microbes make aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine which is a sulfide bridged derivative of alanine
both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin
however in plants aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is an intermediate in the production of the plant hormone ethylene
the formation of amino acids and peptides are assumed to precede and perhaps induce the emergence of life on earth
amino acids can form from simple precursors under various conditions
amino acids and similar building blocks could have been elaborated into proto peptides with peptides being considered key players in the origin of life
in the famous urey miller experiment the passage of an electric arc through a mixture of methane hydrogen and ammonia produces a large number of amino acids
since then scientists have discovered a range of ways and components by which the potentially prebiotic formation and chemical evolution of peptides may have occurred such as condensing agents the design of self replicating peptides and a number of non enzymatic mechanisms by which amino acids could have emerged and elaborated into peptides
according to a review amino acids and even peptides turn up fairly regularly in the various experimental broths that have been allowed to be cooked from simple chemicals
this is because nucleotides are far more difficult to synthesize chemically than amino acids
for a chronological order it suggests that there must have been a protein world or at least a polypeptide world possibly later followed by the rna world and the dna world
codon amino acids mappings may be the biological information system at the primordial origin of life on earth
while amino acids and consequently simple peptides must have formed under different experimentally probed geochemical scenarios the transition from an abiotic world to the first life forms is to a large extent still unresolved
amino acids undergo the reactions expected of the constituent functional groups
as both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage
this polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins
this condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water
in cells this reaction does not occur directly instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer rna molecule through an ester bond
this aminoacyl trna is produced in an atp dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl trna synthetase
this aminoacyl trna is then a substrate for the ribosome which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond
as a result of this mechanism all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their n terminus and moving toward their c terminus
however not all peptide bonds are formed in this way
in a few cases peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes
for example the tripeptide glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress
this peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids
in the first step gamma glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamate through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate and the amino group of the cysteine
this dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione
in chemistry peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions
one of the most used in solid phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units
these are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain which is attached to a solid resin support
libraries of peptides are used in drug discovery through high throughput screening
the combination of functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal amino acid chelates
the multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions
is simply a term we use in theology for the view held by some people before arminius and many after him that sinners who hear the gospel have the free will to accept or reject gods offer of saving grace and that nobody is excluded by god from the possibility of salvation except those who freely exclude themselves
but true historical classical arminianism includes the belief that this free will repent and believe unto salvation is itself a gift of god through prevenient grace
depravity is total arminius states in this state the free will of man towards the true good is not only wounded infirm bent and weakened but it is also imprisoned destroyed and lost
and its powers are not only debilitated and useless unless they be assisted by grace but it has no powers whatever except such as are excited by divine grace
atonement is intended for all jesuss death was for all people jesus draws all people to himself and all people have opportunity for salvation through faith
jesuss death satisfies gods justice the penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through the crucifixion of christ
thus christs death atones for the sins of all but requires faith to be effected
arminius states that justification when used for the act of a judge is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy
or that man is justified before god
according to the rigor of justice without any forgiveness
stephen ashby clarifies arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law or purely by gods imputation of christs righteousness
stephen gunter concurs that arminius would not take a rigid position on the doctrine of imputed righteousness
for keith d
stanglin and thomas h
mccall arminius would not object to saying rather that the righteousness of christ is imputed to righteousness
forlines put it this way on the condition of faith we are placed in union with christ
based on that union we receive his death and righteousness
christs atonement has a substitutionary effect which is limited only to the elect
arminius held that gods justice was satisfied by penal substitution
hugo grotius taught that it was satisfied governmentally
according to roger olson historical and contemporary arminians have held to one of these views
god takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people
this grace often called prevenient grace acts on all people to convince them of the gospel draw them strongly towards salvation and enable the possibility of sincere faith
picirilli states that indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted
the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause effect deterministic method but rather in an influence and response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied
man has a freed will to respond or resist free will is granted and limited by gods sovereignty but gods sovereignty allows all men the choice to accept the gospel of jesus through faith simultaneously allowing all men to resist
conversion is synergistic as roger olson put it evangelical synergism reserves all the power ability and efficacy in salvation to grace but allows humans the god granted ability to resist or not resist it
the only contribution humans make is nonresistance to grace
election is conditional arminius defined election as the decree of god by which of himself from eternity he decreed to justify in christ believers and to accept them unto eternal life
god alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe jesus through faith will be justified
according to arminius god regards no one in christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith
god predestines the elect to a glorious future predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe but rather the predetermination of the believers future inheritance
the elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption glorification and eternal life
related to eschatological considerations jacobus arminius and the first remonstrants including simon episcopius believed in everlasting fire where the wicked are thrown by god at judgment day
preservation is conditional all believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in christ
salvation is conditioned on faith therefore perseverance is also conditioned
arminius believed the scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by christ and the holy spirit to fight against satan sin the world and their own flesh and to gain the victory over these enemies
furthermore christ and the spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations
but this security was not unconditional but conditional provided they stand prepared for the battle implore his help and be not wanting to themselves christ preserves them from falling
arminius believed in the possibility for a believer to commit apostasy
however over the period of time arminius wrote on this question he sometimes expressed himself more cautiously out of consideration for the faith of his readers
for instance arminius declared in that this matter required further study in the scriptures
arminius said also in his declaration of sentiments i never taught that a true believer can either totally or finally fall away from the faith and perish yet i will not conceal that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect and those answers to them which i have been permitted to see are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding
but in his other writings he expressed certainty about the possibility of falling away arminius wrote in c
that a person who is being built into the church of christ may resist the continuation of this process
concerning the believers he said it may suffice to encourage them if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock unless they of their own will forsake their position
he continued by saying that the covenant of god does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from god but a promise of the gift of fear whereby they shall be hindered from going away from god so long as that shall flourish in their hearts
he then taught that had king david died in his sins he would have been lost
in arminius also wrote a believing member of christ may become slothful give place to sin and gradually die altogether ceasing to be a member
for arminius a certain class of sin would cause a believer to fall especially sin motivated by malice
in arminius wrote but it is possible for a believer to fall into a mortal sin as is seen in david
therefore he can fall at that moment in which if he were to die he would be condemned
stanglin along with mccall point out that arminius clearly sets forth two paths to apostasy
rejection or
malicious sinning
oropeza concludes if there is any consistency in arminius position he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away
after the death of arminius in his followers wrote a remonstrance based quite literally on their leaders declaration of sentiments which expressed prudence on the possibility of apostasy
in particular its fifth article expressed the necessity of further study on the possibility of apostasy
sometime between and the official proceeding of the synod of dort the remonstrants became fully persuaded in their minds that the scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever
they formalized their views in the opinion of the remonstrants which was their official stand during the synod of dort
picirilli remarks ever since that early period then when the issue was being examined again arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger
they later expressed this same view in the remonstrant confession
stanglin points out that arminius held that if the apostasy came from malicious sin then it was forgivable
if it came from rejection it was not
following arminius the remonstrants believed that though possible apostasy was not in general irremediable
however other classical arminians as the free will baptists have taught that apostasy is irremediable
john wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what arminius himself taught
wesleyan arminianism is classical arminianism with the addition of wesleyan perfectionism
here are mentioned some positions on specific issues within wesleyan arminianism steven harper proposed that wesleys atonement is a hybrid of the penal substitution theory and the governmental theory
however theologians robert picirilli roger olson and darren cushman wood consider that the view of wesley concerning atonement is by penal substitution
wesleyan arminians have historically adopted either the penal or governmental theory of atonement
wesley accepted the arminian view that genuine christians could apostatize and lose their salvation as his famous sermon a call to backsliders clearly demonstrates
harper summarizes as follows the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvation
the loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged
wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasy
wesley believed that such apostasy was not irremediable
when talking about those who have made shipwreck of their faith wesley claims that not one or a hundred only but i am persuaded several thousands
innumerable are the instances
of those who had fallen but now stand upright
one issue that typifies wesleyan arminianism is christian perfection
according to wesleys teaching christians could attain a state of practical perfection meaning a lack of all voluntary sin by the empowerment of the holy spirit in this life
christian perfection according to wesley is purity of intention dedicating all the life to god and the mind which was in christ enabling us to walk as christ walked
it is loving god with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves
it is a restoration not only to the favour but likewise to the image of god our being filled with the fullness of god
wesley was clear that christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment
it also does not mean we no longer violate the will of god for involuntary transgressions remain
perfected christians remain subject to temptation and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness
it is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love
furthermore wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection but rather says that even perfect holiness is acceptable to god only through jesus christ
the majority arminian view is that election is individual and based on gods foreknowledge of faith
according to the corporate election view god never chose individuals to elect to salvation but rather he chose to elect the believing church to salvation
jesus was the only human ever elected and individuals must be in christ through faith to be part of the elect
corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the old testament and jewish law
identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality
pelagianism is a doctrine denying original sin and total depravity
no system of arminianism founded on arminius or wesley denies original sin or total depravity both arminius and wesley strongly affirmed that mans basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous understand god or seek god
arminius referred to pelagianism as the grand falsehood and stated that he must confess that i detest from my heart the consequences that theology
david pawson a british pastor decries this association as libelous when attributed to arminius or wesleys doctrine
most arminians reject all accusations of pelagianism
some schools of thought notably semi pelagianism which teaches that the first step of salvation is by human will are confused as being arminian in nature
but classical arminianism and wesleyan arminianism hold that the first step of salvation is through the prevenient grace of god though the subsequent grace entails a cooperative relationship
calvinism and arminianism while sharing historical roots and many theological doctrines diverge notably on the concepts of divine predestination and election
while some perceive these differences as fundamental others regard them as relatively minor distinctions within the broader spectrum of christian theology
the doctrine of open theism states that god is omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient but differs on the nature of the future
open theists claim that the future is not completely determined because people have not made their free decisions yet
god therefore knows the future partially in possibilities rather than solely certainties
some arminians such as professor and theologian robert picirilli reject the doctrine of open theism as a deformed arminianism
joseph dongell stated that open theism actually moves beyond classical arminianism towards process theology
there are also some arminians like roger olson who believe open theism to be an alternative view that a christian can have
the alan parsons project were a british rock band active between and whose core membership consisted of producer audio engineer musician and composer alan parsons and singer songwriter and pianist eric woolfson
they were accompanied by varying session musicians and some relatively consistent session players such as guitarist ian bairnson arranger andrew powell bassist and vocalist david paton drummer stuart elliott and vocalists lenny zakatek and chris rainbow
parsons and woolfson shared writing credits on almost all of the projects songs with parsons producing or co producing all of the bands recordings
the alan parsons project released eleven studio albums in its year career the most successful being i robot the turn of a friendly card and eye in the sky
many of their albums are conceptual in nature and focus on science fiction supernatural literary and sociological themes
among the groups most popular songs are i wouldnt want to be like you games people play time sirius eye in the sky and dont answer me
alan parsons met eric woolfson in the canteen of abbey road studios in the summer of
parsons was assistant engineer on the beatles albums abbey road and let it be engineered pink floyds the dark side of the moon and produced several acts for emi records
woolfson a songwriter and composer was working as a session pianist while composing material for a concept album based on the work of edgar allan poe
woolfsons idea was to manage alan and help his already successful production career
this was the start of their longstanding friendly business relationship
he managed parsons career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes including pilot steve harley cockney rebel john miles al stewart ambrosia and the hollies
woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the film industry the focal point of the films promotion shifted from film stars to directors such as alfred hitchcock and stanley kubrick
if the film industry was becoming a directors medium woolfson felt the music business might well become a producers medium
recalling his earlier edgar allan poe material woolfson saw a way to combine his and parsonss talents
parsons produced and engineered songs written and composed by the two and the first alan parsons project was begun
the projects first album tales of mystery and imagination released by th century fox records and including major contributions by all members of pilot and ambrosia was a success reaching the top in the us billboard chart
the song the raven featured lead vocals by the actor leonard whiting
according to the re mastered album liner notes this was the first rock song to use a vocoder with alan parsons speaking lyrics through it although others such as bruce haack pioneered this field in the previous decade
arista records then signed the alan parsons project for further albums
through the late s and early s the projects popularity continued to grow
however the project was always more popular in north america ibero america and continental europe than in parsons home country never achieving a uk top single or top album
the singles i wouldnt want to be like you games people play damned if i do time and eye in the sky had a notable impact on the billboard hot
dont answer me became the projects last successful single in the united states it reached the top on the american charts in
after those successes however the project began to fade from view
there were fewer hit singles and declining album sales
s gaudi was the projects final release though it had planned to record an album called freudiana next
even though the studio version of freudiana was produced by parsons it was primarily woolfsons idea to turn it into a musical
while parsons pursued his own solo career and took many session players of the project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the projects music
freudiana gaudi and gambler were three musicals that included some project songs like eye in the sky time inside looking out and limelight
the live music from gambler was only distributed at the performance site in mnchengladbach germany
in parsons woolfson and their record label arista had been stalled in contract renegotiations when the two submitted an all instrumental album tentatively titled the sicilian defence named after an aggressive opening move in chess arguably to get out of their recording contract
aristas refusal to release the album had two known effects the negotiations led to a renewed contract and the album was not released at that time
in interviews he gave before his death in woolfson said he planned to release one track from the sicilian album which in appeared as a bonus track on a cd re issue of the eve album
sometime later after he had relocated the original tapes parsons reluctantly agreed to release the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming project box set called the complete albums collection in for the first time as a bonus disc
parsons released titles under his name these were try anything once on air the time machine a valid path the secret and from the new world
meanwhile woolfson made concept albums titled freudiana about sigmund freuds work on psychology and this continued from the alan parsons projects first album about edgar allan poes literature
tales of mystery and imagination was re mixed in for release on cd and included narration by orson welles recorded in but delivered too late to be included on the original album
for the deluxe edition release parts of this tape were used for the griffith park planetarium launch of the original album the remix and various radio spots
all were included as bonus material
the bands sound is described as progressive rock art rock progressive pop and soft rock
sirius is their best known and most frequently heard of all parsons woolfson songs
it was used as entrance music by various american sports teams notably by the chicago bulls during their s nba dynasty
it was also used as the entrance theme for ricky steamboat in pro wrestling of the mid s
in addition sirius is played in a variety of tv shows and movies including the bbc series record breakers the episode vanishing act of and the film cloudy with a chance of meatballs
vocal duties were shared by guests to complement each song
in later years woolfson sang lead on many of the groups hits including time eye in the sky and dont answer me
the record company pressured parsons to use woolfson more but parsons preferred to use polished proficient singers woolfson admitted he was not in that category
in addition to woolfson vocalists chris rainbow lenny zakatek john miles david paton and colin blunstone are regulars
other singers such as arthur brown steve harley gary brooker dave terry aka elmer gantry vitamin zs geoff barradale and marmalades dean ford recorded only once or twice with the project
parsons sang lead on one song through a vocoder and backing on a few others including to one in paradise
both of those songs appeared on tales of mystery and imagination
parsons also sings a prominent counter melody on time
a variety of session musicians worked with the alan parsons project regularly contributing to the recognizable style of a song despite the varied singer line up
with parsons and woolfson the studio band consisted of the group pilot with ian bairnson david paton and stuart tosh
pilots keyboardist billy lyall contributed
from pyramid onward tosh was replaced by stuart elliott of cockney rebel
bairnson played on all albums and paton stayed almost until the end
andrew powell appeared as arranger of orchestra on all albums except vulture culture he was composing the score of richard donners film ladyhawke
this score was partly in the app style recorded by most of the app regulars and produced and engineered by parsons
powell composed some material for the first two project albums
for vulture culture and later richard cottle played as a regular contributor on synthesizers and saxophone
the alan parsons project played live only once under that name during its original incarnation because woolfson and parsons held the roles of writing and production and because of the technical difficulties of re producing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio
in the s musical production evolved with the technology of digital samplers
the one occasion the band was introduced as the alan parsons project in a live performance was at the night of the proms in october
the concerts featured all project regulars except woolfson present behind the scenes while parsons stayed at the mixer except for the last song when he played acoustic guitar
since alan parsons continues to perform live as the alan parsons live project to be distinct from the alan parsons project
the current line up consists of lead singer pj olsson guitarist jeffrey kollman drummer danny thompson keyboardist tom brooks bass guitarist guy erez vocalist and saxophonist todd cooper and guitarist and vocalist dan tracey
in alan parsons live project played in colombia with a full choir and orchestra as alan parsons symphonic project
a cd live set and a dvd version of this concert were released in may
in dr evil devised a plan to turn the moon into a death star using a laser invented by dr alan parsons
he called this the alan parsons project
in mathematics the term almost all means all but a negligible quantity
more precisely if formula is a set almost all elements of formula means all elements of formula but those in a negligible subset of formula
the meaning of negligible depends on the mathematical context for instance it can mean finite countable or null
in contrast almost no means a negligible quantity that is almost no elements of formula means a negligible quantity of elements of formula
throughout mathematics almost all is sometimes used to mean all except for finitely many
this use occurs in philosophy as well
similarly almost all can mean all except for countably many
when speaking about the reals sometimes almost all can mean all reals except for a null set
similarly if s is some set of reals almost all numbers in s can mean all numbers in s except for those in a null set
the real line can be thought of as a one dimensional euclidean space
in the more general case of an n dimensional space these definitions can be generalised to all points except for those in a null set or all points in s except for those in a null set
even more generally almost all is sometimes used in the sense of almost everywhere in measure theory or in the closely related sense of almost surely in probability theory
in number theory almost all positive integers can mean the positive integers in a set whose natural density is
that is if a is a set of positive integers and if the proportion of positive integers in a below n tends to as n tends to infinity then almost all positive integers are in a
more generally let s be an infinite set of positive integers such as the set of even positive numbers or the set of primes if a is a subset of s and if the proportion of elements of s below n that are in a tends to as n tends to infinity then it can be said that almost all elements of s are in a
in graph theory if a is a set of graphs it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in a tends to as n tends to infinity
however it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities so the definition is reformulated as follows
the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in a equals the probability that a random graph with n vertices is in a and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them
therefore equivalently to the preceding definition the set a contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip generated graph with n vertices is in a tends to as n tends to infinity
sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some other way where not all graphs with n vertices have the same probability and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one
the use of the term almost all in graph theory is not standard the term asymptotically almost surely is more commonly used for this concept
in topology and especially dynamical systems theory almost all of a topological spaces points can mean all of the spaces points except for those in a meagre set
some use a more limited definition where a subset contains almost all of the spaces points only if it contains some open dense set
in abstract algebra and mathematical logic if u is an on a set x almost all elements of x sometimes means the elements of some element of u
for any partition of x into two disjoint sets one of them will necessarily contain almost all elements of x
it is possible to think of the elements of a filter on x as containing almost all elements of x even if it isnt an ultrafilter
aromatic compounds or arenes usually refers to organic compounds with a chemistry typified by benzene and cyclically conjugated
the word aromatic originates from the past grouping of molecules based on odor before their general chemical properties were understood
the current definition of aromatic compounds does not have any relation to their odor
aromatic compounds are now defined as cyclic compounds satisfying hckels rule
arenes are typically split into two categories benzoids that contain a benzene derivative and follow the benzene ring model and non benzoids that contain other aromatic cyclic derivatives
aromatic compounds are commonly used in organic synthesis and are involved in many reaction types following both additions and removals as well as saturation and dearomatization
heteroarenes are aromatic compounds where at least one methine or vinylene group is replaced by a heteroatom oxygen nitrogen or sulfur
examples of non benzene compounds with aromatic properties are furan a heterocyclic compound with a five membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom and pyridine a heterocyclic compound with a six membered ring containing one nitrogen atom
hydrocarbons without an aromatic ring are called aliphatic
approximately half of compounds known in the year are described as aromatic to some extent
aromatic compounds are pervasive in nature and industry
key industrial aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene toluene xylene called btx
many biomolecules have phenyl groups including the so called aromatic amino acids
benzene ch is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon and it was the first one defined as such
its bonding nature was first recognized independently by joseph loschmidt and august kekul in the th century
each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share
one electron forms a sigma bond with the hydrogen atom and one is used in covalently bonding to each of the two neighboring carbons
this leaves six electrons shared equally around the ring in delocalized pi molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself
this represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon carbon bonds all of bond order this equivalency can also explained by resonance forms
the electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat
the circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by sir robert robinson and his student james armit in and popularized starting in by the morrison boyd textbook on organic chemistry
the proper use of the symbol is debated some publications use it to any cyclic system while others use it only for those systems that obey hckels rule
some argue that in order to stay in line with robinsons originally intended proposal the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic electron systems
in this way the circle symbol for a six center six electron bond can be compared to the y symbol for a three center two electron bond
benzene derivatives have from one to six substituents attached to the central benzene core
examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are phenol which carries a hydroxyl group and toluene with a methyl group
when there is more than one substituent present on the ring their spatial relationship becomes important for which the arene substitution patterns ortho meta and para are devised
when reacting to form more complex benzene derivatives the substituents on a benzene ring can be described as either activated or deactivated which are electron donating and electron withdrawing respectively
activators are known as ortho para directors and deactivators are known as meta directors
upon reacting substituents will be added at the ortho para or meta positions depending on the directivity of the current substituents to make more complex benzene derivatives often with several isomers
electron flow leading to re aromatization is key in ensuring the stability of such products
for example three isomers exist for cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other one position removed from each other or two positions removed from each other
given that both the methyl and hydroxyl group are ortho para directors the ortho and para isomers are typically favoured
xylenol has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group and for this structure isomers exist
arene rings can stabilize charges as seen in for example phenol which is acidic at the hydroxyl as charge on the oxygen is partially delocalized into the benzene ring
although benzylic arenes are common non benzylic compounds are also exceedingly important
any compound containing a cyclic portion that conforms to hckels rule and is not a benzene derivative can be considered a non benzylic aromatic compound
of annulenes larger than benzene and ratio has been estimated to range from in small dark clouds up to in the dense core of the orion molecular cloud complex
although a total of total production routes have been proposed the principal formation mechanism for interstellar is the reaction the rate constant k of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment with a value of formula at k
the rate constant was calculated from the formula
for the primary formation reaction and
assuming an abundance of formulaand an electron abundance of typical of molecular clouds the formation will proceed at a rate of in a molecular cloud of total density
all other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between two and orders of magnitude smaller making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant
as an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play the reaction has a rate constant of assuming densities of and ratio of this reaction proceeds at a rate of more than three orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above
there are total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of
of these were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among c n and o compounds
a review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms with rate constants of and respectively
the above equations run at a rate of and respectively
these calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of and total densities of n typical of cold dense molecular clouds
clearly between these two primary reactions equation is the dominant destruction reaction with a rate times faster than equation
this is due to the relatively high abundance of
radio observations of from the effelsberg m radio telescope reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components a background ridge and an unresolved core
the background corresponds well with the locations previously detected co
the m chilbolton telescope in england detected radio signatures of ammonia in h ii regions hnho masers h h objects and other objects associated with star formation
a comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds
microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including w orion a w w and five sources in the galactic centre
the high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high density regions are common in the galaxy
vla observations of in seven regions with high velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than pc in l s and cepheus a
three individual condensations were detected in cepheus a one of them with a highly elongated shape
they may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region
extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the vla in ic
the hot gas has temperatures above k which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in co
was also monitored by vla toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact hii regions g g g and g
based upon temperature and density diagnostics it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact hii region
absorption at micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the becklin neugebauer object and probably in ngc ir as well
this detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines
a spectrum of the disk of jupiter was obtained from the kuiper airborne observatory covering the to cm spectral range
analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze
a total of dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of dense cores by using the rotating inversion line of nh
in general the cores are not spherically shaped with aspect ratios ranging from to it is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars
ammonia has been detected in the draco nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds which are associated with the high latitude galactic infrared cirrus
the finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the population i metallicity b type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk
by balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission it is possible to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density
moreover since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a level system at low temperatures this calculation is fairly simple
this premise can be applied to dark clouds regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation
detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow linesindicative not only of low temperatures but also of a low level of inner cloud turbulence
line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous co observations
the ammonia observations were consistent with co measurements of rotation temperatures of k
with this densities can be determined and have been calculated to range between and cm in dark clouds
mapping of gives typical clouds sizes of pc and masses near solar mass
these cold dense cores are the sites of future star formation
ultra compact hii regions are among the best tracers of high mass star formation
the dense material surrounding uchii regions is likely primarily molecular
since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material
since this molecular material can be spatially resolved it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources temperatures masses and sizes of the regions
doppler shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars
ammonia has been detected in external galaxies and by simultaneously measuring several lines it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies
line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of parsecs
this picture is consistent with the picture within our milky way galaxyhot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred parsecs
amethyst is a violet variety of quartz
the name comes from the koine greek amethystos from a not and intoxicate a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness
ancient greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxification
amethyst a semiprecious stone is often used in jewelry
amethyst is a purple variety of quartz and owes its violet color to irradiation impurities of iron and in some cases other transition metals and the presence of other trace elements which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions
the irradiation causes the iron ions that replace si in the lattice to lose an electron and form a color center
amethyst is a three dimensional network of tetrahedra where the silicon atoms are in the center and are surrounded by four oxygen atoms located at the vertices of a tetrahedron
this structure is quite rigid and results in quartzs hardness and resistance to weathering
the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz thus making it suitable for use in jewelry
amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light lavender or pale violet to a deep purple
amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues red and blue
high quality amethyst can be found in siberia sri lanka brazil uruguay and the far east
the ideal grade called deep siberian has a primary purple hue of around with blue and red secondary hues
rose de france is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple reminiscent of a lavender lilac shade
these pale colors were once considered undesirable but have recently become popular due to intensive marketing
green quartz is sometimes called green amethyst the scientific name is prasiolite
other names for green quartz are vermarine and lime citrine
amethyst frequently shows color zoning with the most intense color typically found at the crystal terminations
one of gem cutters tasks is to make a finished product with even color
sometimes only a thin layer of a natural uncut amethyst is violet colored or the color is very uneven
the uncut gem may have only a small portion that is suitable for faceting
the color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron for silicon in the structure in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius and to a certain extent the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low
natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet but when heated turns yellow orange yellow brown or dark brownish and may resemble citrine but loses its dichroism unlike genuine citrine
when partially heated amethyst can result in ametrine
amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation
it does not fluoresce under either short wave or long wave uv light
amethyst is found in many locations around the world
between and the greatest production was from marab and pau darco par and the paran basin rio grande do sul brazil sandoval santa cruz bolivia artigas uruguay kalomo zambia and thunder bay ontario
lesser amounts are found in many other locations in africa brazil spain argentina russia afghanistan south korea mexico and the united states
many of the hollow agates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior
artigas uruguay and neighboring brazilian state rio grande do sul are large world producers with lesser quantities mined in minas gerais and bahia states
the largest amethyst geode found as of was the empress of uruguay found in artigas uruguay in
it stands at a height of meters lies open along its length and weighs tons
amethyst is also found and mined in south korea
the large opencast amethyst vein at maissau lower austria was historically important but is no longer included among significant producers
much fine amethyst comes from russia especially near mursinka in the ekaterinburg district where it occurs in drusy cavities in granitic rocks
amethyst was historically mined in many localities in south india though these are no longer significant producers
one of the largest global amethyst producers is zambia in southern africa with an annual production around tons
amethyst occurs at many localities in the united states
the most important production is at four peaks gila and maricopa counties arizona and jacksons crossroads wilkes county georgia
smaller occurrences have been reported in the red feather lakes near fort collins colorado amethyst mountain texas yellowstone national park delaware county pennsylvania haywood county north carolina deer hill and stow maine and in the lake superior region of minnesota wisconsin and michigan
amethyst is relatively common in the canadian provinces of ontario and nova scotia
the largest amethyst mine in north america is located in thunder bay ontario
amethyst is the official state gemstone of south carolina
several south carolina amethysts are on display at the smithsonian museum of natural history
amethyst was used as a gemstone by the ancient egyptians and was largely employed in antiquity for intaglio engraved gems
the ancient greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication while medieval european soldiers wore amethyst amulets as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal people and keep them cool headed
beads of amethyst were found in anglo saxon graves in england
anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an amethyst an allusion to the description of the apostles as not drunk at pentecost in acts
a large geode or amethyst grotto from near santa cruz in southern brazil was presented at a exhibition in dsseldorf germany
synthetic amethyst is produced by a synthesis method called hydrothermal growth which grows the crystals inside a high pressure autoclave
synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst
its chemical and physical properties are the same as those of natural amethyst and it cannot be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing
one test based on brazil law twinning can be used to identify most synthetic amethyst rather easily
synthesizing twinned amethyst is possible but this type is not available in large quantities in the market
treated amethyst is produced by gamma ray x ray or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz which has been first doped with ferric impurities
exposure to heat partially cancels the irradiation effects and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green
much of the citrine cairngorm or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely burnt amethyst
the greek word amethystos may be translated as not drunken from greek a not intoxicated
amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness
albertosaurus is a genus of large tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in northwestern north america during the early to middle maastrichtian age of the late cretaceous period about million years ago
the type species a
sarcophagus was apparently restricted in range to the modern day canadian province of alberta after which the genus is named although an indeterminate species has been discovered in the corral de enmedio and packard formations of mexico
scientists disagree on the content of the genus and some recognize gorgosaurus libratus as a second species
as a tyrannosaurid albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with short arms two fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large sharp teeth a strong sense of smell powerful binocular vision and a bone crushing bite force
it may have even been the apex predator in its local ecosystem
while albertosaurus was certainly large for a theropod it was still much smaller than its larger and more famous relative tyrannosaurus rex growing up to in length and weighing
since the first discovery in fossils of more than individuals have been recovered that provide scientists with a more detailed knowledge of albertosaurus anatomy than what is available for most other tyrannosaurids
the discovery of individuals in one particular site provides evidence of gregarious behavior and allows for studies of ontogeny and population biology
these are near impossible with lesser known dinosaurs because their remains are rarer and more fragmentary when compared to those of albertosaurus
albertosaurus was named by henry fairfield osborn in a one page note at the end of his description of tyrannosaurus rex
its namesake is alberta the canadian province established the very same year where the first remains were found
the generic name also incorporates the greek word sauros meaning lizard which is the most common suffix in dinosaur names
the type species is albertosaurus sarcophagus and the specific name is derived from the ancient greek term meaning flesh eating and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name which is a combination of the greek words and
more than specimens of all ages are known to science
the type specimen is a partial skull collected on june from an outcrop of the horseshoe canyon formation alongside the red deer river in alberta
it was recovered by an expedition of the geological survey of canada led by the famous geologist joseph burr tyrrell
due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured
in tyrrells colleague thomas chesmer weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby
the two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species laelaps incrassatus by edward drinker cope in
although the name laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to dryptosaurus in by othniel charles marsh cope stubbornly refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival
however lawrence lambe used the name dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in and which was a combination first coined by oliver perry hay in
shortly later osborn pointed out that d
incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth so the two horseshoe canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species
the horseshoe canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of d
aquilunguis type species of dryptosaurus so osborn gave them the new name albertosaurus sarcophagus in
he did not describe the remains in any great detail citing lambes complete description the year before
both specimens the holotype cmn and the paratype cmn are stored in the canadian museum of nature in ottawa
by the early twenty first century some concerns had arisen that due to the damaged state of the holotype albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it
however in thomas carr established that the holotype the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy
the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone proves that albertosaurus is a valid taxon
on august american paleontologist barnum brown discovered the remains of a large group of albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the red deer river
because of the large number of bones and the limited time available browns party did not collect every specimen but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bone bed
among the bones deposited in the american museum of natural history collections in new york city are seven sets of right metatarsals along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size
this indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry
palaeontologist philip j
currie of the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in and resumed fieldwork at the site which is now located inside dry island buffalo jump provincial park
further excavation from to turned up the remains of more individuals of various ages including a diminutive two year old and a very old individual estimated at over long
none of these individuals are known from complete skeletons and most are represented by remains in both museums
excavations continued until when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at and at if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny
a total of albertosaurus bones had been secured which is the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the cretaceous
in barnum brown during the second year of the american museum of natural historys operations in alberta uncovered a fragmentary partial albertosaurus skull at the red deer river near tolman bridge
william parks described a new species in albertosaurus arctunguis based on a partial skeleton lacking a skull that was excavated by gus lindblad and ralph hornell near the red deer river in but this species has been considered identical to a
sarcophagus since
parks specimen is housed in the royal ontario museum in toronto
no albertosaurus fossils were found from to but there has been an increase in findings since then
apart from the dry island bonebed six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in alberta and are housed in various canadian museums
specimen rtmp was found in by amateur paleontologist maurice stefanuk
rtmp was found by stefanuk on june
rtmp was found in december
rtmp was found in
rtmp was found in and then there is cmn
unfortunately none of these skeletons were found with complete skulls
fossils have also been reported from the american states of montana new mexico wyoming and missouri but they are doubted to be from a
sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus albertosaurus
two specimens from cf albertosaurus sp have been found in mexico
in paleontologist charles h
sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older dinosaur park formation in alberta
lawrence lambe named this dinosaur gorgosaurus libratus in
other specimens were later found in alberta and the us state of montana
finding no significant differences to separate the two taxa dale russell declared the name gorgosaurus a junior synonym of albertosaurus which had been named first and g
libratus was renamed albertosaurus libratus in
a species distinction was maintained because of the age difference
the addition extended the temporal range of the genus albertosaurus earlier by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres
in philip j
currie benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought
as the two species are sister taxa they are more closely related to each other than to any other species of tyrannosaurid
recognizing this currie nevertheless recommended that albertosaurus and gorgosaurus be kept as separate genera as he concluded that they were no more similar than daspletosaurus and tyrannosaurus which are almost always separated
in addition to this several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from alaska and new mexico
currie suggested that the albertosaurus gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are fully described
most authors have followed curries recommendation but some have not
in anatoly nikolaevich riabinin named albertosaurus pericolosus based on a tooth from china that probably belonged to tarbosaurus
in friedrich von huene renamed dryptosaurus incrassatus not considered a nomen dubium by him to albertosaurus incrassatus
because he had identified gorgosaurus with albertosaurus in russell also renamed gorgosaurus sternbergi into albertosaurus sternbergi and gorgosaurus lancensis into albertosaurus lancensis
the former species is today seen as a juvenile form of gorgosaurus libratus and the latter is seen as either identical to tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus nanotyrannus
in gregory s
paul based albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton specimen lacm from the hell creek formation of montana
it was renamed dinotyrannus in but is now thought to represent a juvenile tyrannosaurus rex
also in paul renamed alectrosaurus olseni into albertosaurus olseni but this has found no general acceptance
in gorgosaurus novojilovi was renamed by bryn mader and robert bradley as albertosaurus novojilovi
on two occasions species based on valid albertosaurus material were reassigned to a different genus deinodon
in william diller matthew renamed a
sarcophagus into deinodon sarcophagus
in german paleontologist oskar kuhn renamed a
arctunguis into deinodon arctunguis
albertosaurus was a fairly large bipedal predator but smaller than tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus rex
typical albertosaurus adults measured up to long and weighed between in body mass
albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus in particular
typical for a theropod albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced its large heavy head and torso with a long muscular tail
however tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two functional fingers the second being longer than the first
the legs were long and ended in a four toed foot on which the first toe the hallux was very short and did not reach the ground
the third toe was longer than the rest
albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of km hour
at least for the younger individuals a high running speed is plausible
two skin impressions from albertosaurus are known and both show scales
one patch is found associated with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long unknown bone indicating that the patch is from the belly
the scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape
also preserved are two larger feature scales placed cm apart from each other making albertosaurus along with carnotaurus the only known theropods with preserved feature scales
another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body
these scales are small diamond shaped and arranged in rows
the massive skull of albertosaurus which was perched on a muscular short s shaped neck was about long in the largest adults
wide openings in the skull called fenestrae provided space for muscle attachment sites and sensory organs that reduced its overall weight
its long jaws contained both sides combined or more banana shaped teeth
larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth but gorgosaurus had
unlike most theropods albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth
the premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw four per side were much smaller than the rest more closely packed and d shaped in cross section
like with tyrannosaurus rex the maxillary teeth of albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey animal
the bite force of albertosaurus was less formidable however with the maximum force by the back teeth reaching newtons
above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and possibly used by males in particular in courtship to attract a mate
in william abler observed that albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla
tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat the tension could cause a purely crack like serration to spread through the tooth
however the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain
the presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering
guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to as abler describes impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity to wood that they work on
the use of a drill to create an ampulla of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces
abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called kerfs and drilled holes was more than stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions
unlike tyrannosaurs more ancient predators like phytosaurs and dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding
albertosaurus is a member of the theropod family tyrannosauridae specifically the subfamily albertosaurinae
its closest relative is the slightly older gorgosaurus libratus
these two species are the only described albertosaurines but other undescribed species may exist
thomas holtz found appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in but his more recent unpublished work places it as a basal eotyrannosaurian just outside of tyrannosauridae in agreement with other authors
the other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is tyrannosaurinae which includes members like daspletosaurus tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus
compared with the more robust tyrannosaurines albertosaurines had slender builds with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower legs and feet
below is the cladogram of tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by loewen et al
most age categories of albertosaurus are represented in the fossil record
using bone histology the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species
the youngest known albertosaurus is a two year old discovered in the dry island bonebed which would have weighed about kilograms and measured slightly more than long
the specimen from the same quarry is years old the oldest and largest one known
when specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph an s shaped growth curve results with the most rapid growth occurring in a four year period ending around the sixteenth year of life a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids
the growth rate during this phase was per year based on an adult weighing tonnes
other studies have suggested higher adult weights which would affect the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern
tyrannosaurids similar in size to albertosaurus had similar growth rates although the much larger tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate at its peak
the end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in albertosaurus although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals lives
sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals like humans and elephants
this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing
during growth thickening of the tooth morphology changed so much that had the association of young and adult skeletons on the dry island bonebed not proven that they belonged to the same taxon the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species
most known albertosaurus individuals were aged years or older at the time of death
juvenile animals are rarely fossilized for several reasons mainly preservation bias where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults and collection bias where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field
young albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals but their remains are still rare in the fossil record when compared to adults
it has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history rather than bias and that fossils of juvenile albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did
a hypothesis of albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers but have not been preserved in the fossil record because of their small size and fragile construction
after just two years juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult albertosaurus and more fleet footed than most of their prey animals
this resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains
mortality rates doubled at age twelve perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen
this elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources and the eventual ever increasing effects of senescence
the higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation
very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such size
high infant mortality rates followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity with very few animals reaching maximum size is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals including elephants african buffalo and rhinoceros
the same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids
the comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role especially since more than two thirds of all albertosaurus specimens are known from the exact same locality
the dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his crew contains the remains of albertosaurus the most individuals found in one locality of any large cretaceous theropod and the second most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the allosaurus assemblage at the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in utah
the group seems to be composed of one very old adult eight adults between and years old seven sub adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between and years old and six juveniles between the ages of and years old that had not yet reached the growth phase
the near absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the albertosaurus bonebed quarry led currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap such as the la brea tar pits in california and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time
currie claims this as evidence of pack behavior
other scientists are skeptical observing that the animals may have been driven together by a drought flood or other reasons
there is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs
however only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site
small theropods like deinonychus and coelophysis have been found in aggregations as have larger predators such as allosaurus and mapusaurus
there is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well as fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside sue the tyrannosaurus mounted in the field museum of natural history in chicago and a bonebed in the two medicine formation of montana contains at least three specimens of daspletosaurus preserved alongside several hadrosaurs
these findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in albertosaurus although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations
others have speculated that instead of social groups at least some of these finds represent komodo dragon like mobbing of carcasses where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and even cannibalized
the evidence of cannibalism was later reported in by coppock and currie
currie has also speculated on the pack hunting habits of albertosaurus
the leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs
younger albertosaurus were probably equally fleet footed or at least faster than their prey
currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults who were larger and more powerful but also slower
juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult albertosaurus in mass
a similar situation is observed in modern komodo dragons with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands
however as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare these ideas cannot readily be tested
in currie though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood
in researchers hypothesized that smooth edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to trichomonas gallinae which infects birds
they suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other and that the infection impaired their ability to eat
in bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior
they found that only one of the albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did
the scientists found that stress fractures were significantly less common in albertosaurus than in the carnosaur allosaurus
rom the holotype of a
arctunguis had a deep hole in the iliac blade although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological
the specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal
in two of the five albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by dale russel as having pathological damage to them
in the health of the dry island albertosaurus assembly was reported upon
most specimens showed no sign of disease
on three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs that consisted of abnormal ossifications of the tendons so called enthesophytes were present but their cause is unknown
two ribs and a belly rib showed signs of breaking and healing
one adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks
the low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a majungasaurus population of which it was established in that of individuals showed bone pathologies
most fossils of albertosaurus sarcophagus are known from the upper horseshoe canyon formation in alberta
these younger units of this geologic formation date to the early maastrichtian age of the late cretaceous period about to million years ago
immediately below this formation is the bearpaw shale a marine formation representing a section of the western interior seaway
the inland sea was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the cretaceous thus exposing land that had previously been underwater
it was not a smooth process however and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout horseshoe canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after
due to the changing sea levels many different environments are represented in the horseshoe canyon formation including offshore and near shore marine habitats and coastal habitats such as lagoons estuaries and tidal flats
numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps
like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of horseshoe canyon times
the fauna of the horseshoe canyon formation is well known as vertebrate fossils including those of dinosaurs are very common
sharks rays sturgeons bowfins gars and the gar like aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna
mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial didelphodon
the saltwater plesiosaur leurospondylus has been found in marine sediments in the horseshoe canyon while freshwater environments were populated by turtles champsosaurus and crocodilians like leidyosuchus and stangerochampsa
dinosaurs dominate the fauna especially hadrosaurs which make up half of all dinosaurs known
these include the genera edmontosaurus saurolophus and hypacrosaurus
ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common together making up another third of the known fauna
along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods including troodontids dromaeosaurids and caenagnathids
intermingled with the albertosaurus remains of the dry island bonebed the bones of the small theropod albertonykus were found
adult albertosaurus were the apex predators in their environment with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurus
in computer programming assembly language often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as asm or asm is any low level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architectures machine code instructions
assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction but constants comments assembler directives symbolic labels of eg memory locations registers and macros are generally also supported
the first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in kathleen and andrew donald booths work coding for arc
assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler
the term assembler is generally attributed to wilkes wheeler and gill in their book the preparation of programs for an electronic digital computer who however used the term to mean a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program
the conversion process is referred to as assembly as in assembling the source code
the computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time
because assembly depends on the machine code instructions each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture
sometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems
most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest
in contrast to assembly languages most high level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling much more complicated tasks than assembling
in the first decades of computing it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming to take place entirely in assembly language
while still irreplaceable for some purposes the majority of programming is now conducted in higher level interpreted and compiled languages
in no silver bullet fred brooks summarised the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity reliability and simplicity has been the progressive use of high level languages for programming
most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity and with concomitant gains in reliability simplicity and comprehensibility
today it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code within larger systems implemented in a higher level language for performance reasons or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher level language
for instance just under of version of the linux kernel source code is written in assembly more than is written in c
assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent eg each low level machine instruction or opcode each directive typically also each architectural register flag etc
some of the mnemonics may be built in and some user defined
many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction
most assemblers permit named constants registers and labels for program and memory locations and can calculate expressions for operands
thus programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code
depending on the architecture these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses
many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development to control the assembly process and to aid debugging
some are column oriented with specific fields in specific columns this was very common for machines using punched cards in the s and early s
some assemblers have free form syntax with fields separated by delimiters eg punctuation white space
some assemblers are hybrid with eg labels in a specific column and other fields separated by delimiters this became more common than column oriented syntax in the s
an assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents
this representation typically includes an operation code as well as other control bits and data
the assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities
the use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications
most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution eg to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline instead of called subroutines
some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set specific optimizations
one concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x assemblers from various vendors
called jump sizing most of them are able to perform jump instruction replacements in any number of passes on request
others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions such as some assemblers for risc architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the cpu pipeline as efficiently as possible
assemblers have been available since the s as the first step above machine language and before high level programming languages such as fortran algol cobol and lisp
there have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages with speedcode as perhaps one of the better known examples
there may be several assemblers with different syntax for a particular cpu or instruction set architecture
for instance an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x family processor might be codice in original intel syntax whereas this would be written codice in the att syntax used by the gnu assembler
despite different appearances different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric machine code
a single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations
there are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed to produce the object file
in both cases the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols
this means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation and if necessary pad it with one or more no operation instructions in a later pass or the errata
in an assembler with peephole optimization addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target
the original reason for the use of one pass assemblers was memory size and speed of assembly often a second pass would require storing the symbol table in memory rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape
later computers with much larger memories had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re reading
the advantage of the multi pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process faster
example in the following code snippet a one pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference bkwd when assembling statement s but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference fwd when assembling the branch statement s indeed fwd may be undefined
a two pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass so they would be known when generating code in pass
see language design below for more details
a program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta statements comments and data
assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by an operand which might be a list of data arguments or parameters
some instructions may be implied which means the data upon which the instruction operates is implicitly defined by the instruction itself such an instruction does not take an operand
the resulting statement is translated by an assembler into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed
for example the instruction below tells an x ia processor to move an immediate bit value into a register
the binary code for this instruction is followed by a bit identifier for which register to use
the identifier for the al register is so the following machine code loads the al register with the data
this binary computer code can be made more human readable by expressing it in hexadecimal as follows
here codice means move a copy of the following value into al and codice is a hexadecimal representation of the value which is in decimal
assembly language for the family provides the mnemonic mov for instructions such as this so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language complete with an explanatory comment if required after the semicolon
this is much easier to read and to remember
mov al h load al with decimal in some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as mov may be used for a family of related instructions for loading copying and moving data whether these are immediate values values in registers or memory locations pointed to by values in registers or by immediate addresses
other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as l for move memory to register st for move register to memory lr for move register to register mvi for move immediate operand to memory etc
if the same mnemonic is used for different instructions that means that the mnemonic corresponds to several different binary instruction codes excluding data depending on the operands that follow the mnemonic
for example for the x ia cpus the intel assembly language syntax codice represents an instruction that moves the contents of register ah into register al
the hexadecimal form of this instruction is the first byte h identifies a move between a byte sized register and either another register or memory and the second byte eh is encoded to specify that both operands are registers the source is ah and the destination is al
in a case like this where the same mnemonic can represent more than one binary instruction the assembler determines which instruction to generate by examining the operands
in the first example the operand codice is a valid hexadecimal numeric constant and is not a valid register name so only the codice instruction can be applicable
in the second example the operand codice is a valid register name and not a valid numeric constant so only the codice instruction can be applicable
assembly languages are always designed so that this sort of lack of ambiguity is universally enforced by their syntax
for example in the intel x assembly language a hexadecimal constant must start with a numeral digit so that the hexadecimal number a would be written as codice or codice not codice specifically so that it cannot appear to be the name of register ah
returning to the original example while the x opcode copies an bit value into the al register moves it into cl and does so into dl
assembly language examples for these follow
mov al h load al with immediate value mov cl h load cl with immediate value mov dl h load dl with immediate value the syntax of mov can also be more complex as the following examples show
mov eax move the bytes in memory at the address contained in ebx into eax mov cl move the contents of cl into the byte at address esieax mov ds dx move the contents of dx into segment register ds in each case the mov mnemonic is translated directly into one of the opcodes c e a a b bf c or c by an assembler and the programmer normally does not have to know or remember which
transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler
unlike high level languages there is a one to one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions
however in some cases an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality
for example for a machine that lacks a branch if greater or equal instruction an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machines set if less than and branch if zero
most full featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences
since the information about pseudoinstructions and macros defined in the assembler environment is not present in the object program a disassembler cannot reconstruct the macro and pseudoinstruction invocations but can only disassemble the actual machine instructions that the assembler generated from those abstract assembly language entities
likewise since comments in the assembly language source file are ignored by the assembler and have no effect on the object code it generates a disassembler is always completely unable to recover source comments
each computer architecture has its own machine language
computers differ in the number and type of operations they support in the different sizes and numbers of registers and in the representations of data in storage
while most general purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality the ways they do so differ the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences
multiple sets of mnemonics or assembly language syntax may exist for a single instruction set typically instantiated in different assembler programs
in these cases the most popular one is usually that supplied by the cpu manufacturer and used in its documentation
two examples of cpus that have two different sets of mnemonics are the intel family and the intel
because intel claimed copyright on its assembly language mnemonics some companies that independently produced cpus compatible with intel instruction sets invented their own mnemonics
the zilog z cpu an enhancement of the intel a supports all the a instructions plus many more zilog invented an entirely new assembly language not only for the new instructions but also for all of the a instructions
for example where intel uses the mnemonics mov mvi lda sta lxi ldax stax lhld and shld for various data transfer instructions the z assembly language uses the mnemonic ld for all of them
a similar case is the nec v and v cpus enhanced copies of the intel and respectively
like zilog with the z nec invented new mnemonics for all of the and instructions to avoid accusations of infringement of intels copyright
it is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the v and v actually wrote in necs assembly language rather than intels since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are isomorphic there is no requirement to use a manufacturers own published assembly language with that manufacturers products
there is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use
in particular some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo operation
a typical assembly language consists of types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations instructions in assembly language are generally very simple unlike those in high level languages
generally a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction
each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands
most instructions refer to a single value or a pair of values
operands can be immediate registers specified in the instruction or implied or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage
this is determined by the underlying processor architecture the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works
extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand eg the system assemblers use as an extended mnemonic for with a mask of and for with a mask of
extended mnemonics are often used to support specialized uses of instructions often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name
for example many cpus do not have an explicit nop instruction but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose
in cpus the instruction is used for with being a pseudo opcode to encode the instruction
some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the instruction as
similarly ibm assemblers for system and system use the extended mnemonics and for and with zero masks
for the sparc architecture these are known as synthetic instructions
some assemblers also support simple built in macro instructions that generate two or more machine instructions
for instance with some z assemblers the instruction is recognized to generate followed by
these are sometimes known as pseudo opcodes
mnemonics are arbitrary symbols in the ieee published standard for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers
the standard has since been withdrawn
there are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables
they define the type of data the length and the alignment of data
these instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs or only to the program in which the data section is defined
some assemblers classify these as pseudo ops
assembly directives also called pseudo opcodes pseudo operations or pseudo ops are commands given to an assembler directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions
directives affect how the assembler operates and may affect the object code the symbol table the listing file and the values of internal assembler parameters
sometimes the term pseudo opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code such as those that generate data
the names of pseudo ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions
pseudo ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer so that one program can be assembled in different ways perhaps for different applications
or a pseudo op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain
another common use of pseudo ops is to reserve storage areas for run time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values
symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names with memory locations and various constants
usually every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name thus promoting self documenting code
in executable code the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point so any calls to a subroutine can use its name
inside subroutines goto destinations are given labels
some assemblers support local symbols which are often lexically distinct from normal symbols
some assemblers such as nasm provide flexible symbol management letting programmers manage different namespaces automatically calculate offsets within data structures and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler
labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses
assembly languages like most other computer languages allow comments to be added to program source code that will be ignored during assembly
judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine
the raw assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made
many assemblers support predefined macros and others support programmer defined macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded
the macro definition is most commonly a mixture of assembler statements eg directives symbolic machine instructions and templates for assembler statements
this sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives
once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic
when the assembler processes such a statement it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro then processes them as if they existed in the source code file
macros in this sense date to ibm autocoders of the s
macro assemblers typically have directives to eg define macros define variables set variables to the result of an arithmetic logical or string expression iterate conditionally generate code
some of those directives may be restricted to use within a macro definition eg mexit in hlasm while others may be permitted within open code eg aif and copy in hlasm
in assembly language the term macro represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts such as the pre processor in the c programming language where its define directive typically is used to create short single line macros
assembler macro instructions like macros in pl i and some other languages can be lengthy programs by themselves executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly
since macros can have short names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter requiring fewer lines of source code as with higher level languages
they can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features
macro assemblers often allow macros to take parameters
some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages incorporating such high level language elements as optional parameters symbolic variables conditionals string manipulation and arithmetic operations all usable during the execution of a given macro and allowing macros to save context or exchange information
thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions based on the macro arguments
this could be used to generate record style data structures or unrolled loops for example or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters
for instance a sort macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key not needing the run time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification
an organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher level language since such programmers are not working with a computers lowest level conceptual elements
underlining this point macros were used to implement an early virtual machine in snobol which was written in the snobol implementation language an assembly language for a virtual machine
the target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assembler
this allowed a high degree of portability for the time
macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems
this was done for example by systems programmers working with ibms conversational monitor system virtual machine and with ibms real time transaction processing add ons customer information control system cics and acp tpf the airline financial system that began in the s and still runs many large computer reservation systems and credit card systems today
it is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages for example to generate a version of a program in cobol using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of cobol code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code
ibm os uses macros to perform system generation
the user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros
assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system including job control language and utility control statements
this is because as was realized in the s the concept of macro processing is independent of the concept of assembly the former being in modern terms more word processing text processing than generating object code
the concept of macro processing appeared and appears in the c programming language which supports preprocessor instructions to set variables and make conditional tests on their values
unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers the c preprocessor is not turing complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or go to the latter allowing programs to loop
despite the power of macro processing it fell into disuse in many high level languages while remaining a perennial for assemblers
macro parameter substitution is strictly by name at macro processing time the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name
the most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name
in the macro the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable and the global variable or constant b would be used to multiply a
if foo is called with the parameter codice the macro expansion of codice occurs
to avoid any possible ambiguity users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions or callers can parenthesize the input parameters
packages of macros have been written providing structured programming elements to encode execution flow
the earliest example of this approach was in the concept macro set originally proposed by harlan mills and implemented by marvin kessler at ibms federal systems division which provided if else endif and similar control flow blocks for os assembler programs
this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of goto operations in assembly code one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language
this approach was widely accepted in the early s
ibms high level assembler toolkit includes such a macro package
a curious design was a natural a stream oriented assembler for z processors from whitesmiths ltd
the language was classified as an assembler because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes registers and memory references but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order
parentheses and other special symbols along with block oriented structured programming constructs controlled the sequence of the generated instructions
a natural was built as the object language of a c compiler rather than for hand coding but its logical syntax won some fans
there has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large scale assembly language development
in spite of that they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target systems architecture prevent the effective use of higher level languages

kathleen booth is credited with inventing assembly language based on theoretical work she began in while working on the arc at birkbeck university of london following consultation by andrew booth with mathematician john von neumann and physicist herman goldstine at the institute for advanced study
in late the electronic delay storage automatic calculator had an assembler integrated into its bootstrap program
it used one letter mnemonics developed by david wheeler who is credited by the ieee computer society as the creator of the first assembler
reports on the edsac introduced the term assembly for the process of combining fields into an instruction word
soap was an assembly language for the ibm computer written by stan poley in
assembly languages eliminate much of the error prone tedious and time consuming first generation programming needed with the earliest computers freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses
they were once widely used for all sorts of programming
however by the late s their use had largely been supplanted by higher level languages in the search for improved programming productivity
today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation access to specialized processor instructions or to address critical performance issues
typical uses are device drivers low level embedded systems and real time systems
numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language
the burroughs mcp was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language it was written in executive systems problem oriented language an algol dialect
many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well including a large amount of the ibm mainframe software written by large corporations
cobol fortran and some pl i eventually displaced much of this work although a number of large organizations retained assembly language application infrastructures well into the s
assembly language has long been the primary development language for bit home computers such as the apple ii atari bit computers msx zx spectrum and commodore
interpreted basic dialects on these systems offer insufficient execution speed and insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware
these systems have severe resource constraints idiosyncratic memory and display architectures and provide limited system services
there are also few high level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use
similarly assembly language is the default choice for bit consoles such as the atari and nintendo entertainment system
key software for ibm pc compatibles was written in assembly language such as ms dos turbo pascal and the lotus spreadsheet
as computer speed grew exponentially assembly language became a tool for speeding up parts of programs such as the rendering of doom rather than a dominant development language
in the s assembly language was used to get performance out of systems such as the sega saturn and as the primary language for arcade hardware based on the tms integrated cpu gpu such as mortal kombat and nba jam
there has been debate over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high level languages
although assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important there are other tools for optimization
the tiobe index of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at ahead of visual basic for example
assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size
in the case of speed optimization modern optimizing compilers are claimed to render high level languages into code that can run as fast as hand written assembly despite the counter examples that can be found
the complexity of modern processors and memory sub systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers as well as for assembly programmers
moreover increasing processor performance has meant that most cpus sit idle most of the time with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses i o operations and paging
this has made raw code execution speed a non issue for many programmers
assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs
although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool the underlying concepts remain important
such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic memory allocation stack processing character set encoding interrupt processing and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level
since a computers behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language
most modern computers have similar instruction sets
therefore studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn i the basic concepts ii to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate and iii to see how efficient executable code can be created from high level languages
in the ancient greek myths ambrosia is the food or drink of the greek gods and is often depicted as conferring longevity or immortality upon whoever consumed it
it was brought to the gods in olympus by doves and served either by hebe or by ganymede at the heavenly feast
ancient art sometimes depicted ambrosia as distributed by the nymph named ambrosia a nurse of dionysus
ambrosia is very closely related to the gods other form of sustenance nectar
the two terms may not have originally been distinguished though in homers poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods it was with ambrosia that hera cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh and with ambrosia athena prepared penelope in her sleep so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors the effects of years had been stripped away and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her
on the other hand in alcman nectar is the food and in sappho and anaxandrides ambrosia is the drink
a character in aristophanes knights says i dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head out of a ladle
both descriptions could be correct as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food
the consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings
upon his assumption into immortality on olympus heracles is given ambrosia by athena while the hero tydeus is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains
in one version of the myth of tantalus part of tantalus crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself he attempts to steal some to give to other mortals
those who consume ambrosia typically have ichor not blood in their veins
both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant and may be used as perfume in the odyssey menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore but the goddess saved us she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils
homer speaks of ambrosial raiment ambrosial locks of hair even the gods ambrosial sandals
among later writers ambrosia has been so often used with generic meanings of delightful liquid that such late writers as athenaeus paulus and dioscurides employ it as a technical term in contexts of cookery medicine and botany
pliny used the term in connection with different plants as did early herbalists
additionally some modern ethnomycologists such as danny staples identify ambrosia with the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita muscaria it was the food of the gods their ambrosia and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices staples asserts
roscher thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of honey in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey and because fermented honey preceded wine as an entheogen in the aegean world on some minoan seals goddesses were represented with bee faces
the concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two ancient indo european languages greek and sanskrit
the greek is semantically linked to the sanskrit as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality
the two words appear to be derived from the same indo european form m ts un dying
a semantically similar etymology exists for nectar the beverage of the gods presumed to be a compound of the pie roots nek death and tar overcoming
lycurgus king of thrace forbade the cult of dionysus whom he drove from thrace and attacked the gods entourage when they celebrated the god
among them was ambrosia who turned herself into a grapevine to hide from his wrath
dionysus enraged by the kings actions drove him mad
in his fit of insanity he killed his son whom he mistook for a stock of ivy and then himself
ambrose of milan venerated as saint ambrose was a theologian and statesman who served as bishop of milan from to
he expressed himself prominently as a public figure fiercely promoting roman christianity against arianism and paganism
he left a substantial collection of writings of which the best known include the ethical commentary de officiis ministrorum and the exegetical
his preachings his actions and his literary works in addition to his innovative musical hymnography made him one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the th century
ambrose was serving as the roman governor of aemilia liguria in milan when he was unexpectedly made bishop of milan in by popular acclamation
as bishop he took a firm position against arianism and attempted to mediate the conflict between the emperors theodosius i and magnus maximus
tradition credits ambrose with developing an antiphonal chant known as ambrosian chant and for composing the te deum hymn though modern scholars now reject both of these attributions
ambroses authorship on at least four hymns including the well known veni redemptor gentium is secure they form the core of the ambrosian hymns which includes others that are sometimes attributed to him
he also had a notable influence on augustine of hippo whom he helped convert to christianity
western christianity identified ambrose as one of its four traditional doctors of the church
he is considered a saint by the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion and various lutheran denominations and venerated as the patron saint of milan and beekeepers
legends about ambrose had spread through the empire long before his biography was written making it difficult for modern historians to understand his true character and fairly place his behaviour within the context of antiquity
most agree he was the personification of his era
this would make ambrose a genuinely spiritual man who spoke up and defended his faith against opponents an aristocrat who retained many of the attitudes and practices of a roman governor and also an ascetic who served the poor
ambrose was born into a roman christian family in the year
ambrose himself wrote that he was years old in his letter number which has been dated to
he began life in augusta treverorum the capital of the roman province of gallia belgica in what was then northeastern gaul and is now in the rhineland palatinate in germany
scholars disagree on who exactly his father was
his father is sometimes identified with aurelius a incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo which is equivalent to the english before christ to identify years before the first year of this era
both dionysius and bede regarded anno domini as beginning at the incarnation of jesus christ but the distinction between incarnation and nativity was not drawn until the late th century when in some places the incarnation epoch was identified with christs conception i
the annunciation on march
on the continent of europe anno domini was introduced as the era of choice of the carolingian renaissance by the english cleric and scholar alcuin in the late eighth century
its endorsement by emperor charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the carolingian empire ultimately lies at the core of the systems prevalence
according to the catholic encyclopedia popes continued to date documents according to regnal years for some time but usage of ad gradually became more common in catholic countries from the th to the th centuries
in portugal became the last western european country to switch to the system begun by dionysius
eastern orthodox countries only began to adopt ad instead of the byzantine calendar in when russia did so with others adopting it in the th and th centuries
although anno domini was in widespread use by the th century the term before christ did not become common until much later
bede used the expression anno
ante incarnationem dominicam twice
anno ante christi nativitatem is found in in a work by a german monk
in the french jesuit theologian denis ptau with his work de doctrina temporum popularized the usage ante christum to mark years prior to ad
when the reckoning from jesus incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western europe various people chose different christian feast days to begin the year christmas annunciation or easter
thus depending on the time and place the year number changed on different days in the year which created slightly different styles in chronology with these various styles the same day could in some cases be dated in or
during the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the christian era european countries used various systems to count years
systems in use included consular dating imperial regnal year dating and creation dating
although the last non imperial consul basilius was appointed in by emperor justinian i later emperors through to constans ii were appointed consuls on the first of january after their accession
all of these emperors except justinian used imperial post consular years for the years of their reign along with their regnal years
long unused this practice was not formally abolished until novell xciv of the law code of leo vi did so in
another calculation had been developed by the alexandrian monk annianus around the year ad placing the annunciation on march ad eight to ten years after the date that dionysius was to imply
although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the byzantine empire years numbered from it an era of incarnation were exclusively used and are still used in ethiopia
this accounts for the seven or eight year discrepancy between the gregorian and ethiopian calendars
byzantine chroniclers like maximus the confessor george syncellus and theophanes dated their years from annianus creation of the world
this era called anno mundi year of the world by modern scholars began its first year on march bc
later byzantine chroniclers used anno mundi years from september bc the byzantine era
no single anno mundi epoch was dominant throughout the christian world
eusebius of caesarea in his chronicle used an era beginning with the birth of abraham dated in bc
spain and portugal continued to date by the spanish era which began counting from bc well into the middle ages
in portugal became the last catholic country to adopt the anno domini system
the era of martyrs which numbered years from the accession of diocletian in who launched the most severe persecution of christians was used by the church of alexandria and is still used officially by the coptic orthodox and coptic catholic churches
it was also used by the ethiopian and eritrean churches
another system was to date from the crucifixion of jesus which as early as hippolytus and tertullian was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the gemini which appears in some medieval manuscripts
alternative names for the anno domini era include vulgaris aerae vulgar era christian era common era and current era
since the alternative abbreviations ce and bce are sometimes used in place of ad and bc
the common current era terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references but still uses the same epoch as the anno domini notation
for example cunningham and starr write that bce ce do not presuppose faith in christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional bc ad upon its foundation the republic of china adopted the minguo era but used the western calendar for international purposes
the translated term was
later in the peoples republic of china adopted for all purposes domestic and foreign
in the ad year numbering system whether applied to the julian or gregorian calendars ad is immediately preceded by bc with nothing in between them
there are debates as to whether a new decade century or millennium begins on a year ending in zero or one
for computational reasons astronomical year numbering and the iso standard designate years so that ad year bc year bc year etc
in common usage ancient dates are expressed in the julian calendar but iso uses the gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application
thus dates using the year or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to bc or ad
av av or av may refer to alcuin of york also called ealhwine alhwin or alchoin was a scholar clergyman poet and teacher from york northumbria
he was born around and became the student of archbishop ecgbert at york
at the invitation of charlemagne he became a leading scholar and teacher at the carolingian court where he remained a figure in the s and s
before that he was also a court chancellor in aachen
the most learned man anywhere to be found according to einhards life of charlemagne he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the carolingian renaissance
among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the carolingian era
alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems
in he was made abbot of marmoutier abbey in tours where he worked on perfecting the carolingian minuscule script
he remained there until his death
alcuin was born in northumbria presumably sometime in the s
virtually nothing is known of his parents family background or origin
in common hagiographical fashion the vita alcuini asserts that alcuin was of noble english stock and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars
alcuins own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as wilgils father of the missionary saint willibrord and beornrad abbot of echternach and bishop of sens
willibrord alcuin and beornrad were all related by blood
in his life of st willibrord alcuin writes that wilgils called a paterfamilias had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the humber which had fallen into alcuins possession by inheritance
because in early anglo latin writing paterfamilias usually referred to a donald a
bullough suggests that alcuins family was of status ie free but subordinate to a noble lord and that alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy
if so alcuins origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as deira
the young alcuin came to the cathedral church of york during the golden age of archbishop ecgbert and his brother the northumbrian king eadberht
ecgbert had been a disciple of the venerable bede who urged him to raise york to an archbishopric
king eadberht and archbishop ecgbert oversaw the re energising and reorganisation of the english church with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that bede had begun
ecgbert was devoted to alcuin who thrived under his tutelage
the york school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts literature and science as well as in religious matters
from here alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the frankish court
he revived the school with the trivium and quadrivium disciplines writing a codex on the trivium while his student hraban wrote one on the quadrivium
alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the s
his ascendancy to the headship of the york school the ancestor of st peters school began after aelbert became archbishop of york in
around the same time alcuin became a deacon in the church
he was never ordained a priest
though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows he lived as if he had
in king elfwald sent alcuin to rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of yorks status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop eanbald i
on his way home he met charlemagne this time in the italian city of parma
alcuins intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join charlemagnes court
he joined an illustrious group of scholars whom charlemagne had gathered around him the mainsprings of the carolingian renaissance peter of pisa paulinus of aquileia rado and abbot fulrad
alcuin would later write the lord was calling me to the service of king charles
alcuin became master of the palace school of charlemagne in aachen in
it had been founded by the kings ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children
however charlemagne wanted to include the liberal arts and most importantly the study of religion
from to alcuin taught charlemagne himself his sons pepin and louis as well as young men sent to be educated at court and the young clerics attached to the palace chapel
bringing with him from york his assistants pyttel sigewulf and joseph alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the palace school introducing charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning to the extent that the institution came to be known as the school of master albinus
in this role as adviser he took issue with the emperors policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death arguing faith is a free act of the will not a forced act
we must appeal to the conscience not compel it by violence
you can force people to be baptised but you cannot force them to believe
his arguments seem to have prevailed charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in
charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court and became far more than just the king at the centre
it seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors
they referred to him as david a reference to the biblical king david
alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with charlemagne and the other men at court where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames
alcuin himself was known as albinus or flaccus
while at aachen alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils derived mainly from virgils eclogues
according to the encyclopdia britannica he loved charlemagne and enjoyed the kings esteem but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love
after the death of pope adrian i alcuin was commissioned by charlemagne to compose an epitaph for adrian
the epitaph was inscribed on black stone quarried at aachen and carried to rome where it was set over adrians tomb in the south transept of st peters basilica just before charlemagnes coronation in the basilica on christmas day
in alcuin returned from the court of charlemagne to england to which he had remained attached
he dwelt there for some time but charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the adoptionist heresy which was at that time making great progress in toledo the old capital of the visigoths and still a major city for the christians under islamic rule in spain
he is believed to have had contacts with beatus of libana from the kingdom of asturias who fought against adoptionism
at the council of frankfurt in alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by felix of urgel an heresiarch according to the catholic encyclopaedia
having failed during his stay in northumbria to influence king thelred in the conduct of his reign alcuin never returned home
he was back at charlemagnes court by at least mid writing a series of letters to thelred to hygbald bishop of lindisfarne and to thelhard archbishop of canterbury in the succeeding months dealing with the viking attack on lindisfarne in july
these letters and alcuins poem on the subject provide the only significant contemporary account of these events
in his description of the viking attack he wrote never before has such terror appeared in britain
behold the church of st cuthbert splattered with the blood of gods priests robbed of its ornaments
in alcuin was in his s
he hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of abbot itherius of saint martin at tours charlemagne put marmoutier abbey into alcuins care with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel
there he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful carolingian minuscule script ancestor of modern roman typefaces using a mixture of upper and lower case letters
latin paleography in the eighth century leaves little room for a single origin of the script and sources contradict his importance as no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script
carolingian minuscule was already in use before alcuin arrived in francia
most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script while at the same time restoring the purity of the form
alcuin died on may some years before the emperor and was buried at st
martins church under an epitaph that partly read the majority of details on alcuins life come from his letters and poems
also autobiographical sections are in alcuins poem on york and in the vita alcuini a hagiography written for him at ferrires in the s possibly based in part on the memories of sigwulf one of alcuins pupils
the collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled propositiones ad acuendos juvenes is sometimes attributed to alcuin
in a letter to charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness which some scholars have identified with the propositiones
the text contains about mathematical word problems in no particular pedagogical order
among the most famous of these problems are four that involve river crossings including the problem of three anxious brothers each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled the problem of the wolf goat and cabbage and the problem of the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults
alcuins sequence is the solution to one of the problems of that book
alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it
he had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy the carolingian minuscule based on round and legible uncial letters
he wrote many letters to his english friends to arno bishop of salzburg and above all to charlemagne
these letters are filled mainly with pious meditations but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the carolingian age
alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety and in the midst of these pursuits he died
alcuin is the most prominent figure of the carolingian renaissance in which three main periods have been distinguished in the first of these up to the arrival of alcuin at the court the italians occupy a central place in the second alcuin and the english are dominant in the third the influence of theodulf the visigoth is preponderant
alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics
these are written in the form of a dialogue and in two of them the interlocutors are charlemagne and alcuin
he wrote several theological treatises a de fide trinitatis and commentaries on the bible
alcuin is credited with inventing the first known question mark though it did not resemble the modern symbol
alcuin transmitted to the franks the knowledge of latin culture which had existed in anglo saxon england
a number of his works still exist
besides some graceful epistles in the style of venantius fortunatus he wrote some long poems and notably he is the author of a history of the church at york versus de patribus regibus et sanctis eboracensis ecclesiae
at the same time he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on old english poetry surviving from the early middle ages in a letter to one speratus the bishop of an unnamed english see
historian john boswell cited alcuins writings as demonstrating a personal outpouring of his internalized homosexual feelings
others agree that alcuin at times comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires
according to david clark passages in some of alcuins writings can be seen to display homosocial desire even possibly homoerotic imagery
however he argues that it is not possible to necessarily determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings on the part of alcuin
the interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by allen frantzen who identifies alcuins language with that of medieval christian amicitia or friendship
douglas dales and rowan williams say the use of language drawn alcuin from the song of songs transforms apparently erotic language into something within christian friendship an ordained affection
alcuin was also a close friend of charlemagnes sister gisela abbess of chelles and he hailed her as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love
he wrote to charlemagnes daughters rotrude and bertha the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me
he dedicated the last two books of his commentary on johns gospel to them both
despite inconclusive evidence of alcuins personal passions he was clear in his own writings that the men of sodom had been punished with fire for sinning against nature with men a view consistent with church teaching
such sins argued alcuin were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the flood and merit to be withered by flames unto eternal barrenness
alcuin is honored in the church of england and in the episcopal church on may the first available day after the day of his death
alcuin is also venerated as a saint by eastern orthodox christians in the british isles and ireland
the orthodox fellowship of st john the baptist publishes a liturgical calendar that is widely used in that region and this calendar includes a feast for st
alcuin college one of the colleges of the university of york is named after him
in january alcuin was the subject of the bbc radio programme in our time

angilbert count of ponthieu was a noble frankish poet who was educated under alcuin and served charlemagne as a secretary diplomat and son in law
he is venerated as a pre congregation saint and is still honored on the day of his death february
angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of charlemagne at the palace school in aquae granni
he was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great english scholar alcuin
when charlemagne sent his young son pepin to italy as king of the lombards angilbert went along as primicerius palatii a high administrator of the satellite court
as the friend and adviser of pepin he assisted for a while in the government of italy
angilbert delivered the document on iconoclasm from the frankish synod of frankfurt to pope adrian i and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope in and
at one time he served an officer of the maritime provinces
he accompanied charlemagne to rome in and was one of the witnesses to his will in
there are various traditions concerning angilberts relationship with bertha daughter of charlemagne
one holds that they were married another that they were not
they had however at least one daughter and two sons one of whom nithard became a notable figure in the mid th century while their daughter bertha went on to marry helgaud ii count of ponthieu
control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the middle ages
bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices
on the other hand some historians have speculated that charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands none of charlemagnes daughters were married despite political offers of arranged marriages
in angilbert retired to the abbey of centulum the monastery of st richarius at present day saint riquier in picardy
elected abbot in he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of volumes
it was not uncommon for the merovingian carolingian or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation
angilbert in contrast spent a great deal rebuilding saint riquier when he completed it charlemagne spent easter of the year there
in keeping with carolingian policies angilbert established a school at saint riquier to educate the local boys
angilberts latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family
charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames
charlemagne was referred to as david a reference to the biblical king david
angilbert was nicknamed homer because he wrote poetry and was the probable author of an epic of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii
it is a mosaic from virgil ovid lucan and venantius fortunatus composed in the manner of einhards use of suetonius
of the shorter poems besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the avars an epistle to david incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperors palace
the reference to bertha however is distant and respectful her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation
the poem de conversione saxonum has been attributed to angilbert
angilberts poems were published by ernst dmmler in the monumenta germaniae historica

in chemistry amines are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair
amines are formally derivatives of ammonia wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group
important amines include amino acids biogenic amines trimethylamine and aniline
inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called amines such as monochloramine
the substituent is called an amino group
compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group thus having the structure are called amides and have different chemical properties from amines
amines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen
aliphatic amines contain only h and alkyl substituents
aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring
it is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen
these species are not amines but are quaternary ammonium cations and have a charged nitrogen center
quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions
amines are named in several ways
typically the compound is given the prefix amino or the suffix amine
the prefix n shows substitution on the nitrogen atom
an organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine triamine tetraamine and so forth
lower amines are named with the suffix amine
higher amines have the prefix amino as a functional group
iupac however does not recommend this convention but prefers the alkanamine form eg butan amine
hydrogen bonding significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines
for example methyl and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids
amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell liquid amines have a distinctive fishy and foul smell
the nitrogen atom features a lone electron pair that can bind h to form an ammonium ion rnh
the lone electron pair is represented in this article by two dots above or next to the n
the water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone electron pairs
typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water primary ammonium secondary ammonium tertiary ammonium
small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic
aromatic amines such as aniline have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished
their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low
typically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques including mass spectrometry as well as nmr and ir spectroscopies
h nmr signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with do
in their infrared spectrum primary amines exhibit two n h bands whereas secondary amines exhibit only one
in their ir spectra primary and secondary amines exhibit distinctive n h stretching bands near cm
somewhat less distinctive are the bands appearing below cm which are weaker and overlap with c c and c h modes
for the case of propyl amine the h n h scissor mode appears near cm the c n stretch near cm and the rn h bend near cm
alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers
c n c and c n h angles approach the idealized angle of
c n distances are slightly shorter than c c distances
the energy barrier for the nitrogen inversion of the stereocenter is about kcal mol for a trialkylamine
the interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind
amines of the type nhrr and nrrr are chiral the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair
because of the low barrier to inversion amines of the type nhrr cannot be obtained in optical purity
for chiral tertiary amines nrrr can only be resolved when the r r and r groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as n substituted aziridines
in aromatic amines nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent
the c n distance is correspondingly shorter
in aniline the c n distance is the same as the c c distances
like ammonia amines are bases
compared to alkali metal hydroxides amines are weaker
owing to inductive effects the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine
correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects
solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines
for anilines the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalizes into the ring resulting in decreased basicity
substituents on the aromatic ring and their positions relative to the amino group also affect basicity as seen in the table
solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines
n h groups strongly interact with water especially in ammonium ions
consequently the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by by solvation
the intrinsic basicity of amines ie the situation where solvation is unimportant has been evaluated in the gas phase
in the gas phase amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron releasing effects of the organic substituents
thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines which are more basic than primary amines and finally ammonia is least basic
the order of pkbs does not follow this order
similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution
in aprotic polar solvents such as dmso dmf and acetonitrile the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol
for this reason the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects
in such reactions which are more useful for alkyl iodides and bromides the degree of alkylation is difficult to control such that one obtains mixtures of primary secondary and tertiary amines as well as quaternary ammonium salts
selectivity can be improved via the delpine reaction although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale
selectivity is also assured in the gabriel synthesis which involves organohalide reacting with potassium phthalimide
aryl halides are much less reactive toward amines and for that reason are more controllable
a popular way to prepare aryl amines is the buchwald hartwig reaction
disubstituted alkenes react with hcn in the presence of strong acids to give formamides which can be decarbonylated
this method the ritter reaction is used industrially to produce tertiary amines such as tert octylamine
hydroamination of alkenes is also widely practiced
the reaction is catalyzed by zeolite based solid acids
via the process of hydrogenation unsaturated n containing functional groups are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst
suitable groups include nitriles azides imines including oximes amides and nitro
in the case of nitriles reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions which can cause hydrolysis of the group
lithium aluminium hydride is more commonly employed for the reduction of these same groups on the laboratory scale
many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via reductive amination which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically
aniline and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics
in industry hydrogen is the preferred reductant whereas in the laboratory tin and iron are often employed
many methods exist for the preparation of amines many of these methods being rather specialized
aside from their basicity the dominant reactivity of amines is their nucleophilicity
most primary amines are good ligands for metal ions to give coordination complexes
amines are alkylated by alkyl halides
acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with primary and secondary amines to form amides
similarly with sulfonyl chlorides one obtains sulfonamides
this transformation known as the hinsberg reaction is a chemical test for the presence of amines
because amines are basic they neutralize acids to form the corresponding ammonium salts
when formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding amides
amines reacts with nitrous acid to give diazonium salts
the alkyl diazonium salts are of little importance because they are too unstable
the most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as aniline anilines and naphthylamines form more stable diazonium salts which can be isolated in the crystalline form
diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the group with anions
for example cuprous cyanide gives the corresponding nitriles aryldiazoniums couple with electron rich aromatic compounds such as a phenol to form azo compounds
such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes
imine formation is an important reaction
primary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form imines
in the case of formaldehyde these products typically exist as cyclic trimers
amines are ubiquitous in biology
the breakdown of amino acids releases amines famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of trimethylamine
many neurotransmitters are amines including epinephrine norepinephrine dopamine serotonin and histamine
protonated amino groups are the most common positively charged moieties in proteins specifically in the amino acid lysine
the anionic polymer dna is typically bound to various amine rich proteins
additionally the terminal charged primary ammonium on lysine forms salt bridges with carboxylate groups of other amino acids in polypeptides which is one of the primary influences on the three dimensional structures of proteins
hormones derived from the modification of amino acids are referred to as amine hormones
typically the original structure of the amino acid is modified such that a cooh or carboxyl group is removed whereas the or amine group remains
amine hormones are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan or tyrosine
primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of azo dyes
it reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound
as azo compounds are highly coloured they are widely used in dyeing industries such as aqueous monoethanolamine diglycolamine diethanolamine diisopropanolamine and methyldiethanolamine are widely used industrially for removing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas and refinery process streams
they may also be used to remove co from combustion gases and flue gases and may have potential for abatement of greenhouse gases
related processes are known as sweetening
amines are often used as epoxy resin curing agents
these include dimethylethylamine cyclohexylamine and a variety of diamines such as diaminodicyclohexylmethane
multifunctional amines such as tetraethylenepentamine and triethylenetetramine are also widely used in this capacity
the reaction proceeds by the lone pair of electrons on the amine nitrogen attacking the outermost carbon on the oxirane ring of the epoxy resin
this relieves ring strain on the epoxide and is the driving force of the reaction
molecules with tertiary amine functionality are often used to accelerate the epoxy amine curing reaction and include substances such as trisphenol
it has been stated that this is the most widely used room temperature accelerator for two component epoxy resin systems
low molecular weight simple amines such as ethylamine are only weakly toxic with between and mg kg
they are skin irritants especially as some are easily absorbed through the skin
amines are a broad class of compounds and more complex members of the class can be extremely bioactive for example strychnine
absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value taken as zero kelvin
the fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy induced particle motion
the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law by international agreement absolute zero is taken as degrees on the celsius scale which equals degrees on the fahrenheit scale
the corresponding kelvin and rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition
it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid and then to solid and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization and enthalpy of fusion exceeds the ideal gass change in enthalpy to absolute zero
in the quantum mechanical description matter at absolute zero is in its ground state the point of lowest internal energy
the laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically
even a system at absolute zero if it could somehow be achieved would still possess quantum mechanical zero point energy the energy of its ground state at absolute zero the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed
scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero where matter exhibits quantum effects such as bose einstein condensate superconductivity and superfluidity
at temperatures near nearly all molecular motion ceases and s for any adiabatic process where s is the entropy
in such a circumstance pure substances can form perfect crystals with no structural imperfections as t
max plancks strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero
the original nernst heat theorem makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as t the implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value
an adiabat is a state with constant entropy typically represented on a graph as a curve in a manner similar to isotherms and isobars
the nernst postulate identifies the isotherm t as coincident with the adiabat s although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct
as no two adiabats intersect no other adiabat can intersect the t isotherm
consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature
a perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions
the perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three axes
every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping
for substances that exist in two stable crystalline forms such as diamond and graphite for carbon there is a kind of chemical degeneracy
the question remains whether both can have zero entropy at t even though each is perfectly ordered
perfect crystals never occur in practice imperfections and even entire amorphous material inclusions can and do get frozen in at low temperatures so transitions to more stable states do not occur
using the debye model the specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to t while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to t
these quantities drop toward their t limiting values and approach with zero slopes
for the specific heats at least the limiting value itself is definitely zero as borne out by experiments to below k
even the less detailed einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats
in fact all specific heats vanish at absolute zero not just those of crystals
likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion
maxwells relations show that various other quantities also vanish
these phenomena were unanticipated
since the relation between changes in gibbs free energy the enthalpy and the entropy is thus as t decreases g and h approach each other
experimentally it is found that all spontaneous processes result in a decrease in g as they proceed toward equilibrium
if s and or t are small the condition g tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on acapulco bay
about seventy three percent of the municipalitys population is involved in commerce most of it related to tourism and the port
mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture
industrial production is limited mostly to bottling milk products cement products and ice and energy production
agricultural products include tomatoes corn watermelon beans green chili peppers and melons
acapulco is one of mexicos oldest coastal tourist destinations reaching prominence in the s as the place where hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale
in modern times tourists in acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail
the city is divided into three tourist areas
traditional acapulco is the old part of the port where hotels like hotel los flamingos owned by personalities johnny weissmuller and john wayne are located is on the northern end of the bay
anchored by attractions such as the beaches of caleta and caletilla the cliff divers of la quebrada and the city square known as el zocalo
the heyday of this part of acapulco ran from the late s until the s with development continuing through the s
this older section of town now caters to a mostly middle class almost exclusively mexican clientele while the glitzier newer section caters to the mexican upper classes many of whom never venture into the older traditional part of town
acapulco dorado had its development between the s and the s and is about minutes from the acapulco international airport
it is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port runs through much of the acapulco bay from icacos passing through costera miguel aleman avenue which is the main one to papagayo park
it has several hotels acapulco diamante also known as punta diamante is the newest and most developed part of the port with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in mexico including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains residential complexes luxury condominiums and private villas spas restaurants shopping areas and a golf course
starting at the scenic highway in las brisas it includes puerto marqus and punta diamante and extends to barra vieja beach
it is minutes from the acapulco international airport
in this area all along boulevard de las naciones almost all transportation is by car limousine or golf cart
acapulcos reputation of a high energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists
from november to april luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the the crystal harmony and all the princess line ships
despite acapulcos international fame most of its visitors are from central mexico especially the affluent from mexico city
acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the mexican cruise line ocean star cruises
for the christmas season of acapulco received visitors most of whom are mexican nationals adding million pesos to the economy
eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air
the area has over condominiums most of which function as second homes for their mexican owners
acapulco is still popular with mexican celebrities and the wealthy such as luis miguel and plcido domingo who maintain homes there
from the latter th century on the city has also taken on other less positive reputations
some consider it a pass resort eclipsed by the newer cancn and cabo san lucas
over the years a number of problems have developed here especially in the bay and the older sections of the city
the large number of wandering vendors on the beaches who offer everything from newspapers to massages are a recognized problem
it is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach but the government says it is difficult to eradicate as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty in the city
around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides populated by migrants who have come to the city looking for work
in the last decade drug related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade
another problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay
although tons have recently been extracted from the bays of acapulco and nearby zihuatanejo more needs to be done
most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them
however the center of the bay is not touched
the reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common in the city to throw it in streets rivers and the bay itself
the most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires
acapulco has seen some success in this area having several beaches receiving the high blue flag certifications for cleanliness and water quality
acapulcos cuisine is very rich
the following are typical dishes from the region relleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes raisins carrots and chiles
it is eaten with bread called bolillo
pozole is a soup with a salsa base hominy meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos like tostadas tacos and tamales
this dish is served as part of a weekly thursday event in the city and the state with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators
acapulcos main attraction is its nightlife as it has been for many decades
nightclubs change names and owners frequently
for example baby o has been open to the national and international public since and different celebrities have visited their installations such as mexican singer luis miguel bono from u and sylvester stallone
another nightclub is palladium located in the escnica avenue the location gives the nightclub a view of the santa lucia bay at night
various djs have had performances in palladium among them dvbbs tom swoon nervo and junkie kid
informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment
in addition there is the beach bar zone where younger crowds go
these are located along the costera road face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock
most are concentrated between the fiesta americana and continental plaza hotels
these places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress
there is a bungee jump in this area as well
another attraction at acapulco is the la quebrada cliff divers
the tradition started in the s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below
eventually locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive
today the divers are professionals diving from heights of into an inlet that is only wide and deep after praying first at a shrine to the virgin of guadalupe
on the evening before december the feast day of this virgin freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her
dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the ocean of fire when the sea is lit with gasoline making a circle of flames which the diver aims for
the spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the hotel plaza las glorias el mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace
there are a number of beaches in the acapulco bay and the immediate coastline
in the bay proper there are the la angosta caleta caletilla dominguillo tlacopanocha hornos hornitos honda tamarindo condesa guitarrn icacos playuela playuelilla and playa del secreto
in the adjoining smaller bay of puerto marqus there is pichilingue las brisas and playa roqueta
facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is pie de la cuesta and southeast are playa revolcadero playa aeromar playa encantada and barra vieja
two lagoons are in the area coyuca to the northwest of acapulco bay and tres palos to the southeast
both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours
tres palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected
in addition to sunbathing the beaches around the bay offer a number of services such as boat rentals boat tours horseback riding scuba diving and other aquatic sports
one popular cruise is from caletilla beach to roqueta island which has places to snorkel have lunch and a lighthouse
there is also an underwater statue of the virgin of guadalupe here created in by armando quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here
many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well where there are sunken ships sea mountains and cave rock formations
another popular activity is deep sea fishing
the major attraction is sail fishing
fish caught here have weighed between and pounds
sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything the trip is free
in the old part of the city there is a traditional main square called the zcalo lined with shade trees cafs and shops
at the north end of the square is nuestra seora de la soledad cathedral with blue onion shaped domes and byzantine towers
the building was originally constructed as a movie set but was later adapted into a church
acapulcos most historic building is the fort of san diego located east of the main square and originally built in to protect the city from pirate attacks
the fort was partially destroyed by the dutch in the mid th century rebuilt then destroyed again in by an earthquake
it was rebuilt again by and this is the building that can be seen today unchanged except for renovations done to it in
parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements
today the fort serves as the museo histrico de acapulco which shows the ports history from the pre hispanic period until independence
there are temporary exhibits as well
for many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse drawn carriages known as calandrias but the practice ended in february due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals
the el rollo acapulco is a sea life and aquatic park located on costera miguel aleman
it offers wave pools water slides and water toboggans
there are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program
the center mostly caters to children
another place that is popular with children is the parque papagayo a large family park which has a life sized replica of a spanish galleon three artificial lakes an aviary a skating rink rides go karts and more
the dolores olmedo house is located in the traditional downtown of acapulco and is noted for the murals by diego rivera that adorn it
olmedo and rivera had been friend since olmedo was a child and rivera spent the last two years of his life here
during that time he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics featuring aztec deities such as quetzalcoatl
the interior of the home is covered in murals
the home is not a museum so only the outside murals can be seen by the public
there is a small museum called casa de la mscara which is dedicated to masks most of them from mexico but there are examples from many parts of the world
the collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called masks of the world mexico across history the huichols and the jaguar alebrijes dances of guerrero devils and death identity and fantasy and afro indian masks
the botanical garden of acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the universidad loyola del pacfico
most of the plants here are native to the region and many such as the peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree are in danger of extinction
one cultural event that is held yearly in acapulco is the festival internacional de la nao which takes place in the fort of san diego located near the zcalo in downtown of the city
the festival honors the remembrance of the citys interaction and trades with oriental territories which started back in the sixteenth century
the nao festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from india china japan philippines thailand indonesia and south korea
the variety of events go from film projections musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes some of the events are specifically for kids
the annual french festival takes place throughout acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between mexico and france
the main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair
the cinpolis galeras diana and the teatro juan ruz de alarcn present french and french literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects
even some of the local nightclubs feature french djs
other festivals celebrated here include carnival the feast of san isidro labrador on may and in november a crafts and livestock fair called the nao de china
there are a number of golf courses in acapulco including the acapulco princess and the pierre marqus course the latter designed by robert trent jones in for the world cup golf tournament
the mayan palace course was designed by pedro guericia and an economical course called the club de golf acapulco is near the convention center
the most exclusive course is that of the tres vidas golf club designed by robert von hagge
it is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds
another famous sport tournament that has been held in acapulco since is the abierto mexicano telcel tennis tournament an atp event that takes place in the tennis courts of the princess mundo imperial a resort located in the diamante zone of acapulco
initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court
the event has gained popularity within the passing of the years attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including novak djokovic rafael nadal and marin cilic
the total prize money is us for wta and us for atp
acapulco also has a bullring called the plaza de toros near caletilla beach
the season runs during the winter and is called the fiesta brava
before over american teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout mexico during spring break each year
the main reason students head to mexico is the drinking age of years something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean
this has become attractive since the s especially since more traditional spring break places such as daytona beach florida have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors
this legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of mexico with acapulco as one of the top destinations
in the late s and early s cancn had been favored as the spring break destination of choice
however cancn has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event and students have been looking for someplace new
this led many more to choose acapulco in spite of the fact that for many travelers the flight is longer and more expensive than to cancn
many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and acapulcos famous nightlife
in students came to acapulco for spring break
hotels did not get that many in due mostly to the economic situation in the united states and partially because of scares of drug related violence
in february the us state department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to acapulco
the warning a result of violent activity springing from mexicos drug cartel dbcle took college campuses by storm with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to mexico over spring break
bill oreilly devoted a segment of his show the oreilly factor to urge students to stay away from acapulco
in june a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government
these included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large caliber weapons and grenades
however no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported
nine passenger airlines including four international ones fly to acapulco international airport
in the city there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations
however an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized colectivo cab system
these cabs cost pesos per person to ride but they are not private
the driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules
the colectivos each travel a designated area of the city the three main ones being costera colosio coloso or a mixture of the three
coloso cabs travel mainly to old acapulco
colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of acapulco
costera cabs drive up and down the coast of acapulco where most of the hotels for visitors are located but which includes some of old acapulco
drivers have discretion over destinations some are willing to travel to the other designated areas especially during slow periods of the day
the bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider
as far as transportation goes it is the cheapest form other than walking in acapulco
the most expensive buses have air conditioning while the cheaper buses do not
for tourists the acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with acapulco painted on the side of them
these buses are not for tourists only but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems
these buses travel the tourist section of acapulco driving up and down the coast
there are buses with specific routes and destinations generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat
perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized with decals and home made interior designs that range from comic book scenes to pornography and even to hello kitty themes
the bus network was simplified on june with the implementation of the
the bus rapid transit system spans with stations spread throughout the city of acapulco along five routes
boarding is sped by pre payment at stations
in the idea to nominate the manila acapulco galleon trade route was initiated by the mexican ambassador to unesco with the filipino ambassador to unesco
an experts roundtable meeting was held at the university of santo tomas on april as part of the preparation of the philippines for the possible transnational nomination of the manila acapulco galleon trade route to the world heritage list
the nomination will be made jointly with mexico
the following are the experts and the topics they discussed during the roundtable meeting dr celestina boncan on the tornaviaje dr mary jane a
bolunia on shipyards in the bicol region mr sheldon clyde jago on bobby orillaneda and ligaya lacsina on underwater archaeology dr leovino garcia on maps and cartography fr
rene javellana sj on fortifications in the philippines felice sta
maria on food dr fernando zialcita on textile and regalado trota jose on historical dimension
the papers presented and discussed during the roundtable meeting will be synthesized into a working document to establish the routes outstanding universal value
the mexican side reiterated that they will also follow suit with the preparations for the routes nomination
spain has also backed the nomination of the manila acapulco trade route in the unesco world heritage site list and has also suggested the archives of the manila acapulco galleons to be nominated as part of a separate unesco list the unesco memory of the world register
alan curtis kay is an american computer scientist best known for his pioneering work on object oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design
at xerox parc he led the design and development of the first modern windowed computer desktop interface
there he also led the development of the influential object oriented programming language smalltalk both personally designing most of the early versions of the language and coining the term object oriented
he has been elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences the national academy of engineering and the royal society of arts
he received the turing award in
in an interview on education in america with the davis group ltd
kay said originally from springfield massachusetts kays family relocated several times due to his fathers career in physiology before ultimately settling in the new york metropolitan area
he attended brooklyn technical high school
having accumulated enough credits to graduate he then attended bethany college in bethany west virginia where he majored in biology and minored in mathematics
kay then taught guitar in denver colorado for a year
he was drafted in the united states army then qualified for officer training in the united states air force where he became a computer programmer after passing an aptitude test
after his discharge he enrolled at the university of colorado boulder and earned a bachelor of science in mathematics and molecular biology in
in the autumn of he began graduate school at the university of utah college of engineering
he earned a master of science in electrical engineering in then a doctor of philosophy in computer science in
his doctoral dissertation flex a flexible extendable language described the invention of a computer language named flex
while there he worked with fathers of computer graphics david c
evans and ivan sutherland
kay credits sutherlands thesis for influencing his views on objects and computer programming
as he grew busier with research for the defense advanced research projects agency he ended his musical career
in he met seymour papert and learned of the programming language logo a dialect of lisp optimized for educational purposes
this led him to learn of the work of jean piaget jerome bruner lev vygotsky and of constructionist learning further influencing his professional orientation
in kay became a visiting researcher at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory in anticipation of accepting a professorship at carnegie mellon university
instead in he joined the xerox parc research staff in palo alto california
through the decade he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language smalltalk
along with some colleagues at parc kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object oriented programming which he named
some original object oriented concepts including the use of the words object and class had been developed for simula at the norwegian computing center
kay said im sorry that i long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea
the big idea is messaging
while at parc kay conceived the dynabook concept a key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the e book
he is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface
because the dynabook was conceived as an educational platform he is considered one of the first researchers into mobile learning many features of the dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the one laptop per child educational platform with which kay is actively involved
from to kay was chief scientist at atari
in he became an apple fellow
after the closure of the apple advanced technology group in he was recruited by his friend bran ferren head of research and development at disney to join walt disney imagineering as a disney fellow
he remained there until ferren left to start applied minds inc with imagineer danny hillis leading to the cessation of the fellows program
in kay founded viewpoints research institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to children learning and advanced software development
for their first ten years kay and his viewpoints group were based at applied minds in glendale california where he and ferren worked on various projects
kay served as president of the institute until its closure in
in kay joined hp labs as a senior fellow departing when hp disbanded the advanced software research team on july
he has been an adjunct professor of computer science at the university of california los angeles a visiting professor at kyoto university and an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology
kay served on the advisory board of tti vanguard
in december while still at apple kay collaborated with many others to start the open source squeak version of smalltalk
as part of this effort in november his team began research on what became the etoys system
more recently he started with david a
smith david p
reed andreas raab rick mcgeer julian lombardi and mark mccahill the croquet project an open source networked d and d environment for collaborative work
in it became clear that the etoy architecture in squeak had reached its limits in what the morphic interface infrastructure could do
andreas raab a researcher in kays group then at hewlett packard proposed defining a script process and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoided several more general problems
the result was a new user interface proposed to replace the squeak morphic user interface
tweak added mechanisms of islands asynchronous messaging players and costumes language extensions projects and tile scripting
its underlying object system is class based but to users it acts as if it were prototype based
tweak objects are created and run in tweak project windows
in november at the world summit on the information society the mit research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer for educational use around the world
it has many names including the laptop the one laptop per child program the childrens machine and the xo
the program was founded and is sustained by kays friend nicholas negroponte and is based on kays dynabook ideal
kay is a prominent co developer of the computer focusing on its educational software using squeak and etoys
kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented
his lectures at the oopsla conference and his acm turing award talk the computer revolution hasnt happened yet were informed by his experiences with sketchpad simula smalltalk and the bloated code of commercial software
on august kays proposal to the united states national science foundation was granted funding viewpoints research institute for several years
the proposal title was steps toward the reinvention of programming a compact and practical model of personal computing as a self exploratorium
steps is a recursive acronym that stands for steps toward expressive programming systems
a sense of what kay is trying to do comes from this quote from the abstract of a seminar at intel research labs berkeley the conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days
we wonder how small could be an understandable practical model t design that covers this functionality m lines of code k loc k loc k loc kay is a former professional jazz guitarist composer and theatrical designer
he also is an amateur classical pipe organist
his other honors include the j d warnier prix dinformatique the acm systems software award the nec computers communication foundation prize the funai foundation prize the lewis branscomb technology award and the acm sigcse award for outstanding contributions to computer science education
apl is a programming language developed in the s by kenneth e
its central datatype is the multidimensional array
it uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators leading to very concise code
it has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling spreadsheets functional programming and computer math packages
it has also inspired several other programming languages
a mathematical notation for manipulating arrays was developed by kenneth e
iverson starting in at harvard university
in he began work for ibm where he developed this notation with adin falkoff and published it in his book a programming language in
the preface states its premise this notation was used inside ibm for short research reports on computer systems such as the burroughs b and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus register machines were being evaluated by ibm for upcoming computers
iverson also used his notation in a draft of the chapter a programming language written for a book he was writing with fred brooks automatic data processing which would be published in
in iverson received the turing award for his work on apl
as early as the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after falkoff discussed with william c
carter his work to standardize the instruction set for the machines that later became the ibm system family
in herbert hellerman working at the ibm systems research institute implemented a part of the notation on an ibm computer and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation
students tested their code in hellermans lab
this implementation of a part of the notation was called personalized array translator
in falkoff iverson and edward h
sussenguth jr all working at ibm used the notation for a formal description of the ibm system series machine architecture and functionality which resulted in a paper published in ibm systems journal in
after this was published the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system
one of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of john l
lawrence who had new duties with science research associates an educational company bought by ibm in
lawrence asked iverson and his group to help use the language as a tool to develop and use computers in education
after lawrence m
breed and philip s
abrams of stanford university joined the team at ibm research they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in fortran iv for a part of the notation which had been done for the ibm computer running on the ibsys operating system
this work was finished in late and later named ivsys
the basis of this implementation was described in detail by abrams in a stanford university technical report an interpreter for iverson notation in
the academic aspect of this was formally supervised by niklaus wirth
like hellermans pat system earlier this implementation did not include the apl character set but used special english reserved words for functions and operators
the system was later adapted for a time sharing system and by november it had been reprogrammed for the ibm system model computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at ibm
a key development in the ability to use apl effectively before the wide use of cathode ray tube terminals was the development of a special ibm selectric typewriter interchangeable typing element with all the special apl characters on it
this was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the selectric typewriter and typing element mechanism such as the ibm and ibm terminal
keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which apl characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck
for the first time a programmer could type in and see proper apl characters as used in iversons notation and not be forced to use awkward english keyword representations of them
falkoff and iverson had the special apl selectric typing elements and designed in late although no apl computer system was available to use them
iverson cited falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an ibm selectric typing element for the apl character set
many apl symbols even with the apl characters on the selectric typing element still had to be typed in by over striking two extant element characters
an example is the grade up character which had to be made from a delta and a sheffer stroke
this was necessary because the apl character set was much larger than the characters allowed on the typing element even when letters were restricted to upper case
the first apl interactive login and creation of an apl workspace was in by larry breed using an ibm terminal at the ibm mohansic labs near thomas j
watson research center the home of apl in yorktown heights new york
ibm was chiefly responsible for introducing apl to the marketplace
the first publicly available version of apl was released in for the ibm
ibm provided apl for free but without liability or support
it would run in as little as k bit words of memory and used a dedicated megabyte hard disk
apl gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late s through the early s in part because it would support multiple users on lower specification systems that had no dynamic address translation hardware
additional improvements in performance for selected ibm system mainframe systems included the apl assist microcode in which some support for apl execution was included in the processors firmware as distinct from being implemented entirely by higher level software
somewhat later as suitably performing hardware was finally growing available in the mid to late s many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment
early ibm apl interpreters for ibm and ibm hardware implemented their own multi user management instead of relying on the host services thus they were their own timesharing systems
first introduced for use at ibm in the apl system was a multi user interpreter
the ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged i beam functions using both monadic and dyadic operations
in ibm released aplsv which was a continuation of the same product but which offered shared variables as a means to access facilities outside of the apl system such as operating system files
in the mid s the ibm mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the ibm desktop computer which had a small crt and an apl keyboard when most other small computers of the time only offered basic
in the s the vsapl program product enjoyed wide use with conversational monitor system time sharing option vspc music sp and cics users
in patrick e
hagerty directed the implementation of the university of maryland apl interpreter for the line of the sperry univac series mainframe computers
in student alan stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function
xerox apl was available from june for xerox and sigma and mainframes running cp v and for honeywell cp
in the s and s several timesharing firms arose that sold apl services using modified versions of the ibm apl interpreter
in north america the better known ones were ip sharp associates scientific time sharing corporation time sharing resources and the computer company
compuserve also entered the market in with an apl interpreter based on a modified version of digital equipment corp and carnegie mellons which ran on decs ki and kl bit machines
compuserves apl was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service
with the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the ibm and later the personal computer by the mid s the timesharing industry was all but gone
sharp apl was available from ip sharp associates first as a timesharing service in the s and later as a program product starting around
sharp apl was an advanced apl implementation with many language extensions such as packages a file system nested arrays and shared variables
apl interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini computer manufacturers also notably burroughs control data corporation data general digital equipment corporation harris hewlett packard siemens xerox and others
garth foster of syracuse university sponsored regular meetings of the apl implementers community at syracuses minnowbrook conference center in blue mountain lake new york
in later years eugene mcdonnell organized similar meetings at the asilomar conference grounds near monterey california and at pajaro dunes near watsonville california
the sigapl special interest group of the association for computing machinery continues to support the apl community
on microcomputers which became available from the mid s onwards basic became the dominant programming language
nevertheless some microcomputers provided apl instead the first being the intel based mcm which was released in and which was primarily used in education
another machine of this time was the videobrain family computer released in which was supplied with its dialect of apl called apl s
the commodore superpet introduced in included an apl interpreter developed by the university of waterloo
in bill gates claimed in his open letter to hobbyists that microsoft corporation was implementing apl for the intel and motorola but had very little incentive to make available to hobbyists because of software piracy
it was never released
starting in the early s ibm apl development under the leadership of jim brown implemented a new version of the apl language that contained as its primary enhancement the concept of nested arrays where an array can contain other arrays and new language features which facilitated integrating nested arrays into program workflow
ken iverson no longer in control of the development of the apl language left ibm and joined i
sharp associates where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of sharp apl to be more in accord with his vision
apl was first released for cms and tso in
the apl workstation edition followed later
as other vendors were busy developing apl interpreters for new hardware notably unix based microcomputers apl was almost always the standard chosen for new apl interpreter developments
even today most apl vendors or their users cite apl compatibility as a selling point for those products
ibm cites its use for problem solving system design prototyping engineering and scientific computations expert systems for teaching mathematics and other subjects visualization and database access
various implementations of apl by aplx dyalog et al
include extensions for object oriented programming support for net xml array conversion primitives graphing operating system interfaces and lambda calculus expressions
freeware versions include gnu apl for linux and nars for windows
both of these are fairly complete versions of apl with various language extensions
apl has been criticized and praised for its choice of a unique non standard character set
in the s and s few terminal devices or even displays could reproduce the apl character set
the most popular ones employed the ibm selectric print mechanism used with a special apl type element
one of the early apl line terminals was the texas instruments ti model with the full apl character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes for interacting with an apl time sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job called an rje
over time with the universal use of high quality graphic displays printing devices and unicode support the apl character font problem has largely been eliminated
however entering apl characters requires the use of input method editors keyboard mappings virtual on screen apl symbol sets or easy reference printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages
with beginners who have no prior experience with other programming languages a study involving high school students found that typing and using apl characters did not hinder the students in any measurable way
in defense of apl it requires fewer characters to type and keyboard mappings become memorized over time
special apl keyboards are also made and in use today as are freely downloadable fonts for operating systems such as microsoft windows
the reported productivity gains assume that one spends enough time working in the language to make it worthwhile to memorize the symbols their semantics and keyboard mappings not to mention a substantial number of idioms for common tasks
unlike traditionally structured programming languages apl code is typically structured as chains of monadic or dyadic functions and operators acting on arrays
apl has many nonstandard primitives that are indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols
all primitives are defined to have the same precedence and always associate to the right
thus apl is read or best understood from right to left
early apl implementations had no programming loop flow control structures such as codice or codice loops and codice constructs
instead they used array operations and use of structured programming constructs was often not necessary since an operation could be performed on a full array in one statement
for example the codice function can replace for loop iteration n when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one dimensional array
more recent implementations of apl generally include comprehensive control structures so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated
the apl environment is called a workspace
in a workspace the user can define programs and data ie the data values exist also outside the programs and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program
in the examples below the apl interpreter first types six spaces before awaiting the users input
its own output starts in column one
the user can save the workspace with all values programs and execution status
apl uses a set of non ascii symbols which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation
having single character names for single instruction multiple data vector functions is one way that apl enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing conways game of life in one line of code
in nearly all versions of apl it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression that is in one line of code
due to the unusual character set many programmers use special keyboards with apl keytops to write apl code
although there are various ways to write apl code using only ascii characters in practice it is almost never done
most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts with special mappings or input method editors to access non ascii characters
historically the apl font has been distinctive with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols
most vendors continue to display the apl character set in a custom font
advocates of apl claim that the examples of so called write only code are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes which can occur in any language
advocates also claim that they are far more productive with apl than with more conventional computer languages and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology
they also may claim that because it is compact and terse apl lends itself well to larger scale software development and complexity because the number of lines of code can be reduced greatly
many apl advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as cobol and java as being comparatively tedious
apl is often found where time to market is important such as with trading systems
apl makes a clear distinction between functions and operators
functions take arrays as arguments and return arrays as results
operators take functions or arrays as arguments and derive related functions
for example the sum function is derived by applying the reduction operator to the addition function
applying the same reduction operator to the maximum function derives a function which returns the largest of a group of numbers
in the j language iverson substituted the terms verb for function and adverb or conjunction for operator
apl also identifies those features built into the language and represented by a symbol or a fixed combination of symbols as primitives
most primitives are either functions or operators
coding apl is largely a process of writing non primitive functions and operators
however a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators most noticeably assignment
some words used in apl literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science
apl has explicit representations of functions operators and syntax thus providing a basis for the clear and explicit statement of extended facilities in the language and tools to experiment on them
hello world a design theme in apl is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages
the hello world string constant above displays because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly
another example of this theme is that exponentiation in apl is written as which indicates raising to the power
many languages use to signify multiplication as in but apl chooses to use
however if no base is specified most programming languages one would see this as a syntax error
apl however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant e and interprets as
suppose that is an array of numbers
then gives its average
reading right to left gives the number of elements in x and since is a dyadic operator the term to its left is required as well
it is surrounded by parentheses since otherwise x would be taken and gives the sum of the elements of x
building on this the following expression computes standard deviation naturally one would define this expression as a function for repeated use rather than rewriting it each time
further since assignment is an operator it can appear within an expression so the following would place suitable values into t av and sd xx the above does a lot concisely although it may seem complex to a new
it combines the following apl functions since there is no function to the left of the left most x to tell apl what to do with the result it simply outputs it to the display without needing any explicit instruction to do that
codice also has a monadic equivalent called codice which simply returns one random integer between and its sole operand the right of it inclusive
thus a role playing game program might use the expression codice to roll a twenty sided die
the following expression finds all prime numbers from to r
in both time and space the calculation complexity is formula
rr xx
the following function life written in dyalog apl takes a boolean matrix and calculates the new generation according to conways game of life
it demonstrates the power of apl to implement a complex algorithm in very little code but understanding it requires some advanced knowledge of apl
this is emphasized text
apl derives its name from the initials of iversons book a programming language even though the book describes iversons mathematical notation rather than the implemented programming language described in this article
the name is used only for actual implementations starting with apl
apl is occasionally re interpreted as array programming language or array processing language thereby making apl into a backronym
there has always been cooperation between apl vendors and joint conferences were held on a regular basis from until
at such conferences apl merchandise was often handed out featuring apl motifs or collection of vendor logos
common were apples and the code snippet which are the symbols produced by the classic apl keyboard layout when holding the apl modifier key and typing apl
despite all these community efforts no universal vendor agnostic logo for the programming language emerged
as popular programming languages increasingly have established recognisable logos fortran getting one in british apl association launched a campaign in the second half of to establish such a logo for apl and after a community election and multiple rounds of feedback a logo was chosen in may
apl is used for many purposes including financial and insurance applications artificial intelligence neural networks and robotics
it has been argued that apl is a calculation tool and not a programming language its symbolic nature and array capabilities have made it popular with domain experts and data scientists who do not have or require the skills of a computer programmer
apl is well suited to image manipulation and computer animation where graphic transformations can be encoded as matrix multiplications
one of the first commercial computer graphics houses digital effects produced an apl graphics product named visions which was used to create television commercials and animation for the film tron
latterly the stormwind boating simulator uses apl to implement its core logic its interfacing to the rendering pipeline middleware and a major part of its physics engine
today apl remains in use in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications for example investment management asset management health care and dna profiling
the first implementation of apl using recognizable apl symbols was apl which ran on the ibm system and was completed in november though at that time remained in use only within ibm
in its implementors larry breed dick lathwell and roger moore were awarded the grace murray hopper award from the association for computing machinery
it was given for their work in the design and implementation of apl setting new standards in simplicity efficiency reliability and response time for interactive systems
in the ibm microcomputer offered apl as one of two built in rom based interpreted languages for the computer complete with a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language
significant developments to apl included cms apl which made use of the virtual storage capabilities of cms and aplsv which introduced shared variables system variables and system functions
it was subsequently ported to the ibm system and vspc platforms until its final release in after which it was replaced by apl
in apl became the first publicly available apl system created by ibm for the ibm
it became the most popular ibm type iii library software that ibm released
aplplus and sharp apl are versions of apl with added business oriented extensions such as data formatting and facilities to store apl arrays in external files
they were jointly developed by two companies employing various members of the original ibm apl development team
the two companies were i
sharp associates an apl services company formed in by ian sharp roger moore and others and stsc a time sharing and consulting service company formed in by lawrence breed and others
together the two developed aplplus and thereafter continued to work together but develop apl separately as aplplus and sharp apl
stsc ported aplplus to many platforms with versions being made for the vax pc and unix whereas ipsa took a different approach to the arrival of the personal computer and made sharp apl available on this platform using additional pc xt hardware
in soliton incorporated was formed to support sharp apl and it developed sharp apl into sax
aplplus continues as apl aplwin
in ian sharp and dan dyer of stsc jointly received the kenneth e
iverson award for outstanding contribution to apl
apl was a significant re implementation of apl by ibm which was developed from and first released in
it provides many additions to the language of which the most notable is nested array support
the entire apl products and services team was awarded the iverson award in
in ibm sold apl to log on software who develop and sell the product as log on apl
in aplgol was released as an experimental version of apl that added structured programming language constructs to the language framework
new statements were added for interstatement control conditional statement execution and statement structuring as well as statements to clarify the intent of the algorithm
it was implemented for hewlett packard in
dyalog apl was first released by british company dyalog ltd
in and is available for aix linux macos and microsoft windows platforms
it is based on apl with extensions to support object oriented programming functional programming and tacit programming
licences are free for personal non commercial use
in two of the development team john scholes and peter donnelly were awarded the iverson award for their work on the interpreter
gitte christensen and morten kromberg were joint recipients of the iverson award in
nars is an open source apl interpreter written by bob smith a prominent apl developer and implementor from stsc in the s and s
nars contains advanced features and new datatypes and runs natively on microsoft windows and other platforms under wine
it is named after a development tool from the s nars
aplx is a cross platform dialect of apl based on apl and with several extensions which was first released by british company microapl in
although no longer in development or on commercial sale it is now available free of charge from dyalog
york apl was developed at the york university ontario around running on ibm mainframes
one notable difference between it and apl was that it defined the shape of a scalar as whereas apl defined it as the more mathematically correct this made it easier to write functions that acted the same with scalars and vectors
gnu apl is a free implementation of extended apl as specified in iso iec and is thus an implementation of apl
it runs on linux macos several bsd dialects and on windows
gnu apl uses unicode internally and can be scripted
it was written by jrgen sauermann
richard stallman founder of the gnu project was an early adopter of apl using it to write a text editor as a high school student in the summer of
apl is traditionally an interpreted language having language characteristics such as weak variable typing not well suited to compilation
however with arrays as its core data structure it provides opportunities for performance gains through parallelism parallel computing massively parallel applications and very large scale integration and from the outset apl has been regarded as a high performance language for example it was noted for the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations because it operates on arrays and performs operations like matrix inversion internally
most apl interpreters support idiom recognition and evaluate common idioms as single operations
for example by evaluating the idiom codice as a single operation the creation of two intermediate arrays is avoided
weak typing in apl means that a name may reference an array a function or an operator
in general the interpreter cannot know in advance which form it will be and must therefore perform analysis syntax checking etc
at run time
however in certain circumstances it is possible to deduce in advance what type a name is expected to reference and then generate bytecode which can be executed with reduced run time overhead
this bytecode can also be optimised using compilation techniques such as constant folding or common subexpression elimination
the interpreter will execute the bytecode when present and when any assumptions which have been made are met
dyalog apl includes support for optimised bytecode
compilation of apl has been the subject of research and experiment since the language first became available the first compiler is considered to be the burroughs apl which was released around
in order to be able to compile apl language limitations have to be imposed
apex is a research apl compiler which was written by robert bernecky and is available under the gnu general public license
the stsc apl compiler is a hybrid of a bytecode optimiser and a compiler it enables compilation of functions to machine code provided that its sub functions and globals are declared but the interpreter is still used as a runtime library and to execute functions which do not meet the compilation requirements
apl has been standardized by the american national standards institute working group xj and international organization for standardization and international electrotechnical commission iso iec joint technical committee subcommittee working group
the core apl language is specified in iso and the extended apl language is specified in iso iec
algol is a family of imperative computer programming languages originally developed in
algol heavily influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the association for computing machinery in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years
in the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is algol like it was arguably more influential than three other high level programming languages among which it was roughly contemporary fortran lisp and cobol
it was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with fortran and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages including pl i simula bcpl b pascal ada and c
algol introduced code blocks and the codice
codice pairs for delimiting them
it was also the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope
moreover it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the algol report introduced backus naur form a principal formal grammar notation for language design
algol is substantially different from algol and was not well received so reference to algol is generally understood to mean algol and its dialects
algol was developed jointly by a committee of european and american computer scientists in a meeting in at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich
it specified three different syntaxes a reference syntax a publication syntax and an implementation syntax syntaxes that permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points for different languages
algol was used mostly by research computer scientists in the united states and in europe commercial applications were hindered by the absence of standard input output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors
algol did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development
john backus developed the backus normal form method of describing programming languages specifically for algol
it was revised and expanded by peter naur for algol and at donald knuths suggestion renamed backus naur form
peter naur as editor of the algol bulletin i was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the european language design group in november
in this capacity i was the editor of the algol report produced as the result of the algol meeting in paris in january
alan perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting the meetings were exhausting interminable and exhilarating
one became aggravated when ones good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others
nevertheless diligence persisted during the entire period
the chemistry of the was excellent
algol inspired many languages that followed it
tony hoare remarked here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors
the scheme programming language a variant of lisp that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of algol also adopted the wording revised report on the algorithmic language scheme for its standards documents in homage to algol
as peter landin noted algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the lambda calculus
perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to john c
reynolds and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity
reynoldss idealized algol also made a convincing methodologic argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call by name languages in contrast with the global effects used by call by value languages such as ml
the conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research along with programming computable functions and ml
to date there have been at least augmentations extensions derivations and sublanguages of algol
the burroughs dialects included special bootstrapping dialects such as espol and newp
the latter is still used for unisys mcp system software
algol as officially defined had no i o facilities implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other
in contrast algol offered an extensive library of transput facilities
algol allowed for two evaluation strategies for parameter passing the common call by value and call by name
call by name has certain effects in contrast to call by reference
for example without specifying the parameters as value or reference it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable
think of passing a pointer to swap
a similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument
call by name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting thunks that are used to implement it
donald knuth devised the man or boy test to separate compilers that correctly implemented recursion and non local references
this test contains an example of call by name
algol was defined using a two level grammar formalism invented by adriaan van wijngaarden and which bears his name
van wijngaarden grammars use a context free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular algol program notably they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled semantics and have to be expressed in ambiguity prone natural language prose and then implemented in compilers as ad hoc code attached to the formal language parser
here is an example of how to produce a table using elliott algol
the following code samples are algol versions of the above algol code samples
algol implementations used algol s approaches to stropping
in algol s case tokens with the bold typeface are reserved words types or operators
note lower and upper bounds of an array and array slicing are directly available to the programmer
the variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic hello world program
algol had no i o facilities
since algol had no i o facilities there is no portable hello world program in algol
the next three examples are in burroughs extended algol
the first two direct output at the interactive terminal they are run on
the first uses a character array similar to c
the language allows the array identifier to be used as a pointer to the array and hence in a replace statement
an even simpler program using the display statement
note that its output would end up at the system console an alternative example using elliott algol i o is as follows
elliott algol used different characters for open string quote and close string quote represented here by and
below is a version from elliott algol
the standard elliott used five hole paper tape and thus only had upper case
the code lacked any quote characters so was used for open quote and for close quote
special sequences were placed in double quotes
the ict series algol i o version allowed input from paper tape or punched card
paper tape full mode allowed lower case
output was to a line printer
the open and close quote characters were represented using and spaces by
algol code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase but bolded or underlined
in the language of the algol report the input output facilities were collectively called the transput
the algols were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly also the algols were defined so that only uppercase letters were required
ifip the algol language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems but unfortunately were unsupported on most computing systems at the time
for instance and
september ascii the ascii character set then in an early stage of development had the character added to it in order to support algols boolean operators and
alcor this character set included the unusual runic cross character for multiplication and the decimal exponent symbol for floating point notation
gost the soviet standard gost allowed the encoding of bit bit bit and bit characters in algol
the algol report used extant algol characters and further adopted and characters which can be found on the ibm keyboard with typeball print heads inserted
these became available in the mid s while algol was being drafted
the report was translated into russian german french and bulgarian and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets eg cyrillic alphabet of the soviet besm
all algols characters are also part of the unicode standard and most of them are available in several popular fonts
october unicode the codice for floating point notation was added to unicode for backward compatibility with historic buran programme algol software
awk is a domain specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool
like sed and grep it is a filter and is a standard feature of most unix like operating systems
the awk language is a data driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline for purposes of extracting or transforming text such as producing formatted reports
the language extensively uses the string datatype associative arrays and regular expressions
while awk has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one liner programs the language is turing complete and even the early bell labs users of awk often wrote well structured large awk programs
awk was created at bell labs in the s and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors alfred aho peter weinberger and brian kernighan
the acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird species auk which is illustrated on the cover of the awk programming language
when written in all lowercase letters as codice it refers to the unix or plan program that runs scripts written in the awk programming language
according to brian kernighan one of the goals of awk was to have a tool that would easily manipulate both numbers and strings
awk was also inspired by marc rochkinds programming language that was used to search for patterns in input data and was implemented using yacc
as one of the early tools to appear in version unix awk added computational features to a unix pipeline besides the bourne shell the only scripting language available in a standard unix environment
it is one of the mandatory utilities of the single unix specification and is required by the linux standard base specification
in awk was one of several unix tools available for charles river data systems unos operating system under bell laboratories license
awk was significantly revised and expanded in resulting in the gnu awk implementation written by paul rubin jay fenlason and richard stallman released in
gnu awk may be the most widely deployed version because it is included with gnu based linux packages
gnu awk has been maintained solely by arnold robbins since
brian kernighans nawk source was first released in unpublicized and publicly since the late s many bsd systems use it to avoid the gpl license
awk was preceded by sed
both were designed for text processing
they share the line oriented data driven paradigm and are particularly suited to writing one liner programs due to the implicit main loop and current line variables
the power and terseness of early awk programs notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables which facilitate one liners together with the limitations of awk at the time were important inspirations for the perl language
in the s perl became very popular competing with awk in the niche of unix text processing languages
where condition is typically an expression and action is a series of commands
the input is split into records where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines
the program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn and executes the action for each expression that is true
either the condition or the action may be omitted
the condition defaults to matching every record
the default action is to print the record
this is the same pattern action structure as sed
in addition to a simple awk expression such as codice or codice the condition can be codice or codice causing the action to be executed before or after all records have been read or pattern pattern which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches pattern up to and including the record that matches pattern before again trying to match against pattern on subsequent lines
in addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators awk expressions include the tilde operator codice which matches a regular expression against a string
as handy syntactic sugar regexp without using the tilde operator matches against the current record this syntax derives from sed which in turn inherited it from the ed editor where codice is used for searching
this syntax of using slashes as delimiters for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by perl and ecmascript and is now common
the tilde operator was also adopted by perl
awk commands are the statements that are substituted for action in the examples above
awk commands can include function calls variable assignments calculations or any combination thereof
awk contains built in support for many functions many more are provided by the various flavors of awk
also some flavors support the inclusion of dynamically linked libraries which can also provide more functions
the print command is used to output text
the output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator whose default value is a newline
the simplest form of this command is although these fields may bear resemblance to variables they actually refer to the fields of the current record
a special case refers to the entire record
in fact the commands codice and codice are identical in functionality
regexpattern regexpattern regexpattern awks built in variables include the field variables and so on
they hold the text or values in the individual text fields in a record
variable names can use any of the characters with the exception of language keywords
the operators represent addition subtraction multiplication and division respectively
for string concatenation simply place two variables next to each other
it is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between
double quotes delimit string constants
statements need not end with semicolons
finally comments can be added to programs by using as the first character on a line or behind a command or sequence of commands
in a format similar to c function definitions consist of the keyword codice the function name argument names and the function body
here is an example of a function
function addthree functions can have variables that are in the local scope
the names of these are added to the end of the argument list though values for these should be omitted when calling the function
it is convention to add some whitespace in the argument list before the local variables to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin
hello world begin print all lines longer than characters
the default action is to print the current line
length as there is no pattern for the first line of the program every line of input matches by default so the increment actions are executed for every line
codice is shorthand for codice
s is incremented by the numeric value of nf which is the last word on the line as defined by awks field separator
nf is the number of fields in the current line eg
since is the value of the fourth field nf is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines
is actually a unary operator with the highest operator precedence
at the end of the input the end pattern matches so s is printed
however since there may have been no lines of input at all in which case no value has ever been assigned to s it will by default be an empty string
adding zero to a variable is an awk idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value
with the coercion the program prints on an empty input without it an empty line is printed
the action statement prints each line numbered
the printf function emulates the standard c printf and works similarly to the print command described above
the pattern to match however works as follows nr is the number of records typically lines of input awk has so far read ie the current line number starting at for the first line of input
is the modulo operator
nr is true for the st th th etc
lines of input
likewise nr is true for the rd th th etc
lines of input
the range pattern is false until the first part matches on line and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches on line
it then stays false until the first part matches again on line
thus the program prints lines skips line and then and so on
for each line it prints the line number and then the line contents
for example when executed on this input as a special case when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true eg the range will start at the beginning of the input
similarly if the second part is constantly false eg the range will continue until the end of input
for example prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression cut here that is a line containing only the phrase cut here to the end
begin end the begin block sets the field separator to any sequence of non alphabetic characters
separators can be regular expressions
after that we get to a bare action which performs the action on every input line
in this case for every field on the line we add one to the number of times that word first converted to lowercase appears
finally in the end block we print the words with their frequencies
the line creates a loop that goes through the array words setting i to each subscript of the array
this is different from most languages where such a loop goes through each value in the array
the loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count
codice was an addition to the one true awk made after the book was published
this program can be represented in several ways
the first one uses the bourne shell to make a shell script that does everything
it is the shortest of these methods pattern shift awk pattern print filename the codice in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces
a pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line matches
codice contains the current filename
awk has no explicit concatenation operator two adjacent strings concatenate them
codice expands to the original unchanged input line
there are alternate ways of writing this
this shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk export pattern shift awk environpattern print filename this is a shell script that uses codice an array introduced in a newer version of the one true awk after the book was published
the subscript of codice is the name of an environment variable its result is the variables value
this is like the getenv function in various standard libraries and posix
the shell script makes an environment variable codice containing the first argument then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file
codice checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand codice is its inverse
a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables
pattern shift awk pattern print filename patternpattern or you can use the v varvalue command line option
begin the codice is necessary not only to extract the first argument but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codice block ends
codice the number of arguments is always guaranteed to be as codice
codice is the empty string codice
codice initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line
note the codice block
awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command
this means that only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codice is run if you explicitly set codice to so that there are no arguments awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files
therefore you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename codice
on unix like operating systems self contained awk scripts can be constructed using the shebang syntax
it can be invoked with codice the codice tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from which is the same flag that is used in sed
since they are often used for one liners both these programs default to executing a program given as a command line argument rather than a separate file
awk was originally written in and distributed with version unix
in its authors started expanding the language most significantly by adding user defined functions
the language is described in the book the awk programming language published and its implementation was made available in releases of unix system v
to avoid confusion with the incompatible older version this version was sometimes called new awk or nawk
this implementation was released under a free software license in and is still maintained by brian kernighan
old versions of unix such as unix v included codice which converted awk to c
kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into c its state is not known
in nordic mythology asgard is a location associated with the gods
it appears in several old norse sagas and mythological texts including the eddas however it has also been suggested to be referred to indirectly in some of these sources
it is described as the fortified home of the sir gods and is often associated with gold imagery and contains many other locations known in nordic mythology such as valhll iavllr and hlidskjlf
in some euhemeristic accounts asgard is portrayed as being a city in asia or troy however in other accounts that likely more accurately reflect its conception in old nordic religion it is depicted as not conforming to a naturalistic geographical position
in these latter accounts it is found in a range of locations such as over the rainbow bridge bifrst in the middle of the world and over the sea
the word sgarr is a compound formed from and
possible anglicisations include sgarthr sgard segard sgardr asgardr sgarth asgarth esageard and sgardhr
asgard is named twice in eddic poetry
the first case is in hymiskvia when thor and tr journey from asgard to hymirs hall to obtain a cauldron large enough to brew beer for a feast for gir and the gods
the second instance is in rymskvia when loki is attempting to convince thor to dress up as freyja in order to get back mjlnir by claiming that without his hammer to protect them jtnar would soon be living in asgard
grmnisml contains among its cosmological descriptions a number of abodes of the gods such as lfheim natn and valhalla which some scholars have identified as being in asgard
it is to be noted however that asgard is not mentioned at any point in the poem
furthermore vlusp references iavllr one of the most common meeting places of sir gods which in gylfaginning snorri locates in the centre of asgard
the prose eddas euhemeristic prologue portrays the sir gods as people that travelled from the east to northern territories
according to snorri asgard represented the town of troy before greek warriors overtook it
after the defeat trojans moved to northern europe where they became a dominant group due to their advanced technologies and culture
eventually other tribes began to perceive the trojans and their leader trr as gods
in gylfaginning snorri sturluson describes how during the creation of the world the gods made the earth and surrounded it with the sea
they made the sky from the skull of ymir and settled the on the shores of the earth
they set down the brows of ymir forming midgard and in the centre of the world they built asgard which he identifies as troy after asgard is made the gods then built a hof named glasheimr at iavllr in the centre of the burg or walled city with a high seat for odin and twelve seats for other gods
it is described as like gold both on the inside and the outside and as the best of all buildings in the world
they also built vinglf for the female gods which is described as both a hall and a hrgr and a forge with which they crafted objects from gold
after ragnark some gods such as vli and baldr will meet at iavllr where asgard once stood and discuss matters together
there they will also find in the grass the golden chess pieces that the sir had once owned
later the section describes how an unnamed jtunn came to the gods with his stallion svailfari and offered help in building a burg for the gods in three winters asking in return for the sun moon and marriage with freyja
despite freyjas opposition together the gods agree to fulfill his request if he completes his work in just one winter
as time goes on the gods grow desperate as it becomes apparent that the jtunn will construct the burg on time
to their surprise his stallion contributes much of the progress swiftly moving boulders and rocks
to deal with the problem loki comes up with a plan whereupon he changes his appearance to that of a mare and distracts svailfari to slow down construction
without the help of his stallion the builder realises he cannot complete his task in time and goes into a rage revealing his identity as a jtunn
thor then kills the builder with mjllnir before any harm to the gods is done
the chapter does not explicitly name asgard as the fortress but they are commonly identified by scholars
in gylfaginning the central cosmic tree yggdrasil is described as having three roots that hold it up one of these goes to the sir which has been interpreted as meaning asgard
in grmnisml this root instead reaches over the realm of men
the bridge bifrst is told to span from the heavens to the earth and over it the sir cross each day to hold council beneath yggdrasil at the urarbrunnr
based on this bifrst is commonly interpreted as the bridge to asgard
asgard is mentioned briefly throughout skldskaparml as the name for the home of the sir as in gylfaginning
in this section a number of locations are described as lying within asgard including valhalla and in front of its doors the golden grove glasir
it also records a name for thor as defender of sgard
in the ynglinga saga found in heimskringla snorri describes asgard as a city in asia based on a perceived but erroneous connection between the words for asia and sir
in the opening stanzas of the saga of the ynglings asgard is the capital of asaland a section of asia east of the river tana kvsl or vana kvsl which snorri explains is the river tanais flowing into the black sea
odin then leaves to settle in the northern part of the world and leaves his brothers vili and v to rule over the city
when the euhemerised odin dies the account states that the swedes believed he had returned to asgard and would live there forever
cosmology in old nordic religion is presented in a vague and often contradictory manner when viewed from a naturalistic standpoint
snorri places asgard in the centre of the world surrounded by midgard and then the lands inhabited by all of which are finally encircled by the sea
he also locates the homes of the gods in the heavens
this had led to the proposition of a system of concentric circles centred on asgard or yggdrasil and sometimes with a vertical axis leading upwards towards the heavens
there is debate between scholars over whether the gods were conceived of as living in the heavens with some aligning their views with snorri and others proposing that he at times presents the system in a christian framework and that this organisation is not seen in either eddic or skaldic poetry
the concept of attempting to create a spatial cosmological model has itself been criticised by scholars who argue that the oral traditions did not form a naturalistic structured system that aimed to be internally geographically consistent
an alternative proposal is that the world should be conceived of as a number of realms connected by passages that cannot be typically traversed
this would explain how asgard can be located both to the east and west of the realm of men over the sea and over bifrst
it has been noted that the tendency to link asgard to troy is part of a wider european cultural practice of claiming trojan origins for ones culture first seen in the aeneid and also featuring in geoffrey of monmouths historia regum britanniae for the founding of britain
thor first appeared in the marvel universe within comic series journey into mystery in the issues during august
following this release he becomes one of the central figures in the comics along with loki and odin
in the marvel cinematic universe thor and loki make their first appearance together in the film thor
after that thor becomes a regular character in the marvel cinematic universe and reappears in several films including the avengers series
asgard becomes the central element of the film where it is destroyed following the old norse mythos
these and other norse mythology elements also appear in video games tv series and books based in and on the marvel universe although these depictions do not closely follow historical sources
asgard is an explorable realm in the video game god of war ragnark a sequel to s norse themed god of war
in the assassins creed valhalla video game asgard is featured as part of a vision quest
the apollo program also known as project apollo was the united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration which succeeded in preparing and landing the first men on the moon from to
it was first conceived in during president dwight d
eisenhowers administration as a three person spacecraft to follow the one person project mercury which put the first americans in space
apollo was later dedicated to president john f
kennedys national goal for the s of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth in an address to congress on may
it was the third us human spaceflight program to fly preceded by the two person project gemini conceived in to extend spaceflight capability in support of apollo
kennedys goal was accomplished on the apollo mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their apollo lunar module on july and walked on the lunar surface while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module and all three landed safely on earth in the pacific ocean on july
five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last apollo in december
in these six spaceflights twelve people walked on the moon
apollo ran from to with the first crewed flight in
it encountered a major setback in when an apollo cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test
after the first successful landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration
budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these
five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the apollo landing had to be aborted after an oxygen tank exploded en route to the moon crippling the csm
the crew barely managed a safe return to earth by using the lunar module as a lifeboat on the return journey
apollo used the saturn family of rockets as launch vehicles which were also used for an apollo applications program which consisted of skylab a space station that supported three crewed missions in and the apollo soyuz test project a joint united states soviet union low earth orbit mission in
apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones
it stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low earth orbit
apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body and apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one
overall the apollo program returned of lunar rocks and soil to earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the moons composition and geological history
the program laid the foundation for nasas subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center
apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers
the program was named after apollo the greek god of light music and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein who later said i was naming the spacecraft like id name my baby
silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program
the context of this was that the program focused at its beginning mainly on developing an advanced crewed spacecraft the apollo command and service module succeeding the mercury program
a lunar landing became the focus of the program only in
thereafter project gemini instead followed the mercury program to test and study advanced crewed spaceflight technology
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early as a follow up to project mercury
while the mercury capsule could support only one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission apollo would carry three
possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station circumlunar flights and eventual crewed lunar landings
in july nasa deputy administrator hugh l
dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences
preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module and a propulsion and equipment module
on august a feasibility study competition was announced and on october three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics convair general electric and the glenn l
martin company
meanwhile nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs
in november john f
kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense
up to the election of kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had developed between the soviet union and the united states due to the inaction of president eisenhower
beyond military power kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige pledging to make the us not first but first and first if but first period
despite kennedys rhetoric he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president
he knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a crewed moon landing
when kennedys newly appointed nasa administrator james e
webb requested a percent budget increase for his agency kennedy supported an acceleration of nasas large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue
on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union
at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarins flight many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up
kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news refusing to make a commitment on americas response to the soviets
on april kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b
johnson asking johnson to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up
johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership
his memo concluded that a crewed moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first
at the time of kennedys proposal only one american had flown in space less than a month earlier and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit
even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedys ambitious goal could be met
by kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us ussr moon mission to eliminate duplication of effort
with the clear goal of a crewed landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights nasa decided that in order to make progress quickly it would discard the feasibility study designs of convair ge and martin and proceed with fagets command and service module design
the mission module was determined to be useful only as an extra room and therefore unnecessary
they used fagets design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in october
on november it was announced that north american aviation had won the contract although its bid was not rated as good as the martin proposal
webb dryden and robert seamans chose it in preference due to north americans longer association with nasa and its predecessor
landing humans on the moon by the end of required the most sudden burst of technological creativity and the largest commitment of resources ever made by any nation in peacetime
at its peak the apollo program employed people and required the support of over industrial firms and universities
on july nasa established the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama
msfc designed the heavy lift class saturn launch vehicles which would be required for apollo
it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r
gilruths space task group which had been directing the nations crewed space program from nasas langley research center
so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center the manned spacecraft center
a site was chosen in houston texas on land donated by rice university and administrator webb announced the conversion on september
it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida so a new mission control center would be included in the msc
the msc was completed in september
it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in
it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida
the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end lc and lc
but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the crewed lunar mission so land acquisition was started in july for a launch operations center immediately north of canaveral at merritt island
the design development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h
debus a member of wernher von brauns original v rocket engineering team
debus was named the locs first director
construction began in november
following kennedys death president johnson issued an executive order on november to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy
the loc included launch complex a launch control center and a vertical assembly building
in which the space vehicle would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a crawler transporter to one of several launch pads
although at least three pads were planned only two designated aandb were completed in october
the loc also included an operations and checkout building to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles
the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to which is nearly a vacuum
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization so he recruited george e
mueller for a high management job
mueller accepted on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo
webb then worked with associate administrator seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight
on july webb announced muellers appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight to replace then associate administrator d
brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september
under webbs reorganization the directors of the manned spacecraft center marshall space flight center and the launch operations center reported to mueller
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high ranking officers in the us air force so he got webbs permission to recruit general samuel c
phillips who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program as omsf program controller
phillipss superior officer bernard a
schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa along with a staff of officers under him on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director
mueller agreed and phillips managed apollo from january until it achieved the first human landing in july after which he returned to air force duty
charles fishman in one giant leap estimated the number of people and organizations involved into the apollo program as men and women at some different companies contributed to the effort
once kennedy had defined a goal the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life limiting cost and not exceeding limits in possible technology and astronaut skill
four possible mission modes were considered in early direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa
many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking maneuvers that had not been attempted in earth orbit would be nearly impossible in lunar orbit
lor advocates including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach
throughout and houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option
bypassing the nasa hierarchy he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question
seamanss establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e
golovin in july to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program represented a turning point in nasas mission mode decision
this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor lor mode
its consideration of lor as well as houbolts ceaseless work played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach
in late and early members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight joseph shea who became a champion of lor
the engineers at marshall space flight center who were heavily invested in direct ascent took longer to become convinced of its merits but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing on june
but even after nasa reached internal agreement it was far from smooth sailing
kennedys science advisor jerome wiesner who had expressed his opposition to human spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office and had opposed the decision to land people on the moon hired golovin who had left nasa to chair his own space vehicle panel ostensibly to monitor but actually to second guess nasas decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea seamans and even webb to defend themselves delaying its formal announcement to the press on july and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as tentative
wiesner kept up the pressure even making the disagreement public during a two day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center
wiesner blurted out no thats no good in front of the press during a presentation by von braun
webb jumped in and defended von braun until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was still subject to final review
webb held firm and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module contractors
wiesner finally relented unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedys office because of the presidents involvement with the october cuban missile crisis and fear of kennedys support for webb
nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship
some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen
in an msc study concluded the lm lifeboat
was finally dropped because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps
ironically just such a failure happened on apollo when an oxygen tank explosion left the csm without electrical power
the lunar module provided propulsion electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely
fagets preliminary apollo design employed a cone shaped command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power sized appropriately for the space station cislunar and lunar landing missions
once kennedys moon landing goal became official detailed design began of a command and service module in which the crew would spend the entire direct ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip after being soft landed by a larger landing propulsion module
the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csms role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew along with a new spacecraft the lunar excursion module but still pronounced which would take two individuals to the lunar surface and return them to the csm
the command module was the conical crew cabin designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing
it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs
its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield and had its own reaction control system engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path
parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown
the module was tall in diameter and weighed approximately
a cylindrical service module supported the command module with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants
a high gain s band antenna was used for long distance communications on the lunar flights
on the extended lunar missions an orbital scientific instrument package was carried
the service module was discarded just before reentry
the module was long and in diameter
the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately fully fueled while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa
because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off the moon and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight
also there was no provision for docking with the lunar module
a program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing while block ii the actual lunar spacecraft would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development
the apollo lunar module was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module
not designed to fly through the earths atmosphere or return to earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction
it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine
the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment
the ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system
the initial lm model weighed approximately and allowed surface stays up to around hours
an extended lunar module weighed over and allowed surface stays of more than three days
the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to grumman aircraft engineering corporation and the project was overseen by thomas j
before the apollo program began wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles the saturn series and the even larger nova series
in the midst of these plans von braun was transferred from the army to nasa and was made director of the marshall space flight center
the initial direct ascent plan to send the three person apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface on top of a large descent rocket stage would require a nova class launcher with a lunar payload capability of over
the june decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo
since apollo like mercury used more than one launch vehicle for space missions nasa used spacecraft launch vehicle combination series numbers as x for saturn i as x for saturn ib and as x for saturn v to designate and plan all missions rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini
this was changed by the time human flights began
since apollo like mercury would require a launch escape system in case of a launch failure a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system
a rocket bigger than the little joe used by mercury would be required so the little joe ii was built by general dynamics convair
after an august qualification test flight four les test flights were made at the white sands missile range between may and january
saturn i the first us heavy lift launch vehicle was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests
the s i first stage burned rp with liquid oxygen oxidizer in eight clustered rocketdyne h engines to produce of thrust
the s iv second stage used six liquid hydrogen fueled pratt whitney rl engines with of thrust
the s v third stage flew inactively on saturn i four times
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc with only the first stage live carrying dummy upper stages filled with water
the first flight with a live s iv was launched from lc
this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms into orbit in and
the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts
in september nasa planned to launch four crewed csm flights on the saturn i from late through concurrent with project gemini
the payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included so the decision was made in october to use the uprated saturn ib for all crewed earth orbital flights
the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i
the s ib first stage increased the thrust to by uprating the h engine
the second stage replaced the s iv with the s ivb powered by a single j engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox to produce of thrust
a restartable version of the s ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v
the saturn ib could send over into low earth orbit sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm
saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as series number as indicating apollo saturn and the indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family
saturn v launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as series number as indicating apollo saturn and the indicating saturn v
the three stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon
it was in diameter and stood tall with its lunar payload
its capability grew to for the later advanced lunar landings
the s ic first stage burned rp lox for a rated thrust of which was upgraded to
the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen the third stage was a modified version of the s ivb with thrust increased to and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit
nasas director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was donald k
deke slayton one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september due to a heart murmur
slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments
thirty two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program
twenty four of these left earths orbit and flew around the moon between december and december
half of the walked on the moons surface though none of them returned to it after landing once
one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist
of the gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the apollo mission
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans plus from two later astronaut groups
all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans
crews on all development flights through the first two landings on apollo and apollo included at least two gemini veterans
harrison schmitt a geologist was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space and landed on the moon on the last mission apollo
schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews
nasa awarded all of these astronauts its highest honor the distinguished service medal given for distinguished service ability or courage and personal contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission
the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom white and chaffee in then to the crews of all missions from apollo onward
the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo walter m
schirra donn eisele and walter cunningham were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal because of discipline problems with the flight directors orders during their flight
in october the nasa administrator decided to award them the distinguished service medals
for schirra and eisele this was posthumously
two block i csms were launched from lc on suborbital flights in with the saturn ib
the first as launched on february reached an altitude of and splashed down downrange in the atlantic ocean
the second as on august reached altitude and was recovered downrange in the pacific ocean
these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield
a third saturn ib test as launched from pad went into orbit to support design of the s ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v
it carried a nose cone instead of the apollo spacecraft and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors and a tv camera
this flight occurred on july before as which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight
two crewed orbital block i csm missions were planned as and as
the block i crew positions were titled command pilot senior pilot and pilot
the senior pilot would assume navigation duties while the pilot would function as a systems engineer
the astronauts would wear a modified version of the gemini spacesuit
after an uncrewed lm test flight as a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as or as
the block ii crew positions were titled commander command module pilot and lunar module pilot
the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo al spacesuit designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity
the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear fishbowl type for greater visibility and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water cooled undergarment
deke slayton the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs selected the first apollo crew in january with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn f
eisele as pilot
but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january
slayton replaced him with chaffee
nasa announced the final crew selection for as on march with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott with rookie russell l
rusty schweickart
mercury gemini veteran wally schirra eisele and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september as the prime crew for as
in december the as mission was canceled since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the day first flight and as would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft
its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission now redesignated as or as planned for august
mcdivitt scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as crew and schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo backup crew
the spacecraft for the as and as missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight these delays caused the launch of as to slip behind as and eliminated hopes the first crewed mission might be ready to launch as soon as november concurrently with the last gemini mission
eventually the planned as flight date was pushed to february
north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm but for the saturnv s ii second stage as well and delays in this stage pushed the first uncrewed saturnv flight as from late to november
the problems with north american were severe enough in late to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a tiger team to investigate north americans problems and identify corrections
phillips documented his findings in a december letter to naa president lee atwood with a strongly worded letter by mueller and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans
meanwhile grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module eliminating hopes it would be ready for crewed flight in not long after the first crewed csm flights
grissom white and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo as a motivational focus on the first crewed flight
they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center
a plugs out test was planned for january which would simulate a launch countdown on lc with the spacecraft transferring from pad supplied to internal power
if successful this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february launch with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled
the plugs out test began on the morning of january and immediately was plagued with problems
first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch
then communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown
during this hold an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure oxygen atmosphere
pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew
the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened
nasa immediately convened an accident review board overseen by both houses of congress
while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in command module design workmanship and quality control
at the insistence of nasa administrator webb north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager
webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office manager joseph francis shea replacing him with george low
to remedy the causes of the fire changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures the most important of which were use of a nitrogen oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials
the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug type hatch cover with a quick release outward opening door
nasa discontinued the crewed block i program using the blocki spacecraft only for uncrewed saturnv flights
crew members would also exclusively wear modified fire resistant al block ii space suits and would be designated by the block ii titles regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not
on april mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme using sequential numbers for all flights crewed or uncrewed
the sequence would start with apollo to cover the first three uncrewed flights while retiring the apollo designation to honor the crew per their widows wishes
in september mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the crewed lunar landing
each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary therefore letters were used instead of numbers
the a missions were uncrewed saturn v validation b was uncrewed lm validation using the saturn ib c was crewed csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib d was the first crewed csm lm flight e would be a higher earth orbit csm lm flight f would be the first lunar mission testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing and g would be the first crewed landing
the list of types covered follow on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings i for lunar orbital survey missions and j for extended stay lunar landings
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on human rating the lm and saturnv
apollo was the first uncrewed flight of the saturnv carrying a blocki csm on november
the capability of the command modules heat shield to survive a trans lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth orbital reentry speed
apollo was the first uncrewed test flight of the lm in earth orbit launched from pad on january by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo
the lm engines were successfully test fired and restarted despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing
the ascent engine was fired in abort mode known as a fire in the hole test where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage
although grumman wanted a second uncrewed test george low decided the next lm flight would be crewed
this was followed on april by apollo which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast
the intent of this mission was to achieve trans lunar injection followed closely by a simulated direct return abort using the service module engine to achieve another high speed reentry
the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation a problem caused by non steady engine combustion which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages
two s ii engines shut down prematurely but the remaining engines were able to compensate
the damage to the third stage engine was more severe preventing it from restarting for trans lunar injection
mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo
based on the good performance of apollo and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo problems nasa declared the saturnv ready to fly crew canceling a third uncrewed test
apollo launched from lc on october was the cmission crewed by schirra eisele and cunningham
it was an day earth orbital flight which tested the csm systems
apollo was planned to be the d mission in december crewed by mcdivitt scott and schweickart launched on a saturnv instead of two saturn ibs
in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time
rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth orbiting mission aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo to orbit the moon instead deferring the dmission to the next mission in march and eliminating the e mission
this would keep the program on track
the soviet union had sent two tortoises mealworms wine flies and other lifeforms around the moon on september aboard zond and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts
the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo
gemini veterans frank borman and jim lovell and rookie william anders captured the worlds attention by making ten lunar orbits in hours transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve and returning safely to earth
the following march lm flight rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in earth orbit on apollo and schweickart tested the full lunar eva suit with its portable life support system outside the lm
the f mission was successfully carried out on apollo in may by gemini veterans thomas p
stafford john young and eugene cernan
stafford and cernan took the lm to within of the lunar surface
the g mission was achieved on apollo in july by an all gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong michael collins and buzz aldrin
armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at utc on july
they spent a total of hours minutes on the surface and spent hours minutes outside the spacecraft walking on the surface taking photographs collecting material samples and deploying automated scientific instruments while continuously sending black and white television back to earth
the astronauts returned safely on july
conrad and rookie alan l
bean made a precision landing of apollo within walking distance of the surveyor uncrewed lunar probe which had landed in april on the ocean of storms
the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f
gordon jr conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun
they made two evas totaling hours and minutes
on one they walked to the surveyor photographed it and removed some parts which they returned to earth
the contracted batch of saturn vs was enough for lunar landing missions through apollo
shortly after apollo nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites after apollo with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions along with the payload capacity of the saturn v
these final missions would combine the i and j types in the list allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days
these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm
also the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander with two rookies
apollo launched lovell jack swigert and fred haise in april headed for the fra mauro formation
but two days out a liquid oxygen tank exploded disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a lifeboat to return to earth
another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications
apollo was grounded again for the remainder of while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added
about the time of the first landing in it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre built on the ground replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches this eliminated apollo
nasas yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle
by the decision was made to also cancel missions and
the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f
kennedy space center on merritt island florida george c
marshall space center in huntsville alabama michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana and lyndon b
johnson space center in houston texas
the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions
apollo had been planned to be the last of the h series missions but since there would be only two subsequent missions left it was changed to the first of three j missions
apollo s fra mauro mission was reassigned to apollo commanded in february by mercury veteran alan shepard with stuart roosa and edgar mitchell
this time the mission was successful
shepard and mitchell spent hours and minutes on the surface and completed two evas totalling hours minutes which was a record for the longest eva by a lunar crew at the time
in august just after conclusion of the apollo mission president richard nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions apollo and
office of management and budget deputy director caspar weinberger was opposed to this and persuaded nixon to keep the remaining missions
apollo was launched on july with david scott alfred worden and james irwin
scott and irwin landed on july near hadley rille and spent just under two days hours on the surface
in over hours of eva they collected about of lunar material
apollo landed in the descartes highlands on april
the crew was commanded by john young with ken mattingly and charles duke
young and duke spent just under three days on the surface with a total of over hours eva
apollo was the last of the apollo program landing in the taurus littrow region in december
eugene cernan commanded ronald e
evans and nasas first scientist astronaut geologist harrison h
schmitt was originally scheduled for apollo but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing
cernan and schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over hours of total eva
several missions were planned for but were canceled before details were finalized
source apollo by the numbers a statistical reference the apollo program returned over of lunar rocks and soil to the lunar receiving laboratory in houston
today of the samples are stored at the lunar sample laboratory facility built in
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth as measured by radiometric dating techniques
they range in age from about billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria to about billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust
as such they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system that are largely absent on earth
one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo mission
this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium rich feldspar mineral anorthite and is believed to be representative of the highland crust
a geochemical component called kreep was discovered by apollo which has no known terrestrial counterpart
kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects
many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters which is never seen on earth rocks due to the thick atmosphere
many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events
some of the returned samples are of impact melt all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events
from analyses of the composition of the returned lunar samples it is now believed that the moon was created through the impact of a large astronomical body with earth
apollo cost billion or approximately billion using improved cost analysis
of this amount billion was spent on the design development and production of the saturn family of launch vehicles the apollo spacecraft spacesuits scientific experiments and mission operations
the cost of constructing and operating apollo related ground facilities such as the nasa human spaceflight centers and the global tracking and data acquisition network added an additional billion
the amount grows to billion if the costs for related projects such as project gemini and the robotic ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter programs are included
accurate estimates of human spaceflight costs were difficult in the early s as the capability was new and management experience was lacking
preliminary cost analysis by nasa estimated billion billion for a crewed lunar landing effort
nasa administrator james webb increased this estimate to billion before reporting it to vice president johnson in april
project apollo was a massive undertaking representing the largest research and development project in peacetime
at its peak it employed over employees and contractors around the country and accounted for more than half of nasas total spending in the s
after the first moon landing public and political interest waned including that of president nixon who wanted to rein in federal spending
nasas budget could not sustain apollo missions which cost on average million each while simultaneously developing the space shuttle
the final fiscal year of apollo funding was
looking beyond the crewed lunar landings nasa investigated several post lunar applications for apollo hardware
the apollo extension series proposed up to flights to earth orbit using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter to house a small orbital laboratory
astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station
this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s ivb saturn upper stage and grew into the apollo applications program
the workshop was to be supplemented by the apollo telescope mount which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack
the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly by mission
the s ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board
dubbed skylab it was assembled on the ground rather than in space and launched in using the two lower stages of a saturn v
it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount
skylabs last crew departed the station on february and the station itself re entered the atmosphere in after development of the space shuttle was delayed too long to save it
the apollo soyuz program also used apollo hardware for the first joint nation spaceflight paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the space shuttle and international space station programs
in japan aerospace exploration agencys selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface
beginning in nasas robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter while orbiting above the moon photographed the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface and each site where crewed apollo flights landed
all of the us flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing with the exception of the one left during the apollo mission which was blown over during that missions lift off from the lunar surface the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown
the flags cannot be seen through a telescope from earth
the apollo program has been described as the greatest technological achievement in human history
apollo stimulated many areas of technology leading to over spinoff products as of including advances in the development of cordless power tools fireproof materials heart monitors solar panels digital imaging and the use of liquid methane as fuel
the flight computer design used in both the lunar and command modules was along with the polaris and minuteman missile systems the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits
by apollo was using percent of the united states production of ics
the crucial difference between the requirements of apollo and the missile programs was apollos much greater need for reliability
while the navy and air force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles the political and financial cost of failure of an apollo mission was unacceptably high
technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini
the apollo project was enabled by nasas adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in the interplanetary monitoring platform and silicon integrated circuit chips in the apollo guidance computer
the crew of apollo sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth and read from the creation story in the book of genesis on christmas eve
an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo moonwalk
the apollo program also affected environmental activism in the s due to photos taken by the astronauts
the most well known include earthrise taken by william anders on apollo and the blue marble taken by the apollo astronauts
the blue marble was released during a surge in environmentalism and became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of earths frailty vulnerability and isolation amid the vast expanse of space
according to the economist apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedys goal of taking on the soviet union in the space race by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement to demonstrate the superiority of the free market system
the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast centralized government bureaucracy
prior to apollo s th anniversary in nasa searched for the original videotapes of the missions live televised moonwalk
after an exhaustive three year search it was concluded that the tapes had probably been erased and reused
a new digitally remastered version of the best available broadcast television footage was released instead
an assault is the illegal act of causing physical harm or unwanted physical contact to another person or in some legal definitions the threat or attempt to do so
it is both a crime and a tort and therefore may result in criminal prosecution civil liability or both
additionally assault is a criminal act in which a person intentionally causes fear of physical harm or offensive contact to another person
assault can be committed with or without a weapon and can range from physical violence to threats of violence
assault is frequently referred to as an attempt to commit battery which is the deliberate use of physical force against another person
the deliberate inflicting of fear apprehension or terror is another definition of assault that can be found in several legal systems
depending on the severity of the offense assault may result in a fine imprisonment or even death
generally the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law
traditionally common law legal systems have separate definitions for assault and battery
when this distinction is observed battery refers to the actual bodily contact whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery
some jurisdictions combined the two offenses into a single crime called assault and battery which then became widely referred to as assault
the result is that in many of these jurisdictions assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery
the legal systems of civil law and scots law have never distinguished assault from battery
legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity
in the united states an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony
in england and wales and australia it can be charged as either common assault assault occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm
canada also has a three tier system assault assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault
separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults affray and assaulting a police officer
assault may overlap with an attempted crime for example an assault may be charged as attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill
battery is a criminal offense that involves the use of physical force against another person without their consent
it is a type of assault and is considered a serious crime
battery can include a wide range of actions from slapping someone to causing serious harm or even death
depending on the severity of the offense it can carry a wide range of punishments including jail time fines and probation
in jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two assault usually accompanies battery if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat
see common assault
the elements of battery are that it is a volitional act done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and which causes such contact
aggravated assault is a violent crime that involves violence or the threat of violence
it is generally described as an intentional act that causes another person to fear imminent physical harm or injury
this can include the use of a weapon or the threat of using a weapon
it is usually considered a felony offense and can carry severe penalties
aggravated assault is often considered a very serious crime and can lead to long term prison sentences
aggravated assault is in some jurisdictions a stronger form of assault usually using a deadly weapon
a person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants
exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm
assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others
consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault
in some jurisdictions most notably england it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault
this can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity the most notable case being the operation spanner case
legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery activities within the rules of a game bodily adornment or horseplay
however any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent
in scottish law consent is not a defense for assault
police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties
thus a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary
in some jurisdictions such as singapore judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system
the officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault
in the united states england northern ireland australia and canada corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable
what constitutes reasonable varies in both statutory law and case law
unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse
in english law s
children act limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault
this defence was abolished in wales in
many countries including some us states also permit the use of controversial corporal punishment for children in school or home
this may or may not involve self defense in that using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence
some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property to prevent damage either in its own right or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self help
furthermore some jurisdictions such as ohio allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder
the resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruders presence
the following are the countries with the most cases of assault according to the united nations in
the term assault when used in legislation commonly refers to both common assault and battery even though the two offences remain distinct
common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force
each state has legislation relating to the act of assault and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the magistrates court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a district or supreme court of that state
the legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault
in new south wales the crimes act defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties
these include assault is an offence under s
of the canadian criminal code
there is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur
generally an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent
it can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force or threatens to do so without the consent of the other person
an injury need not occur for an assault to be committed but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force
it can be an assault to tap pinch push or direct another such minor action toward another but an accidental application of force is not an assault
the potential punishment for an assault in canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed
the criminal code defines assault as a dual offence
police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the publics interest to do so notwithstanding s of the code
this public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim
an individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm aggravated assault or any sexual assault
consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused
a person cannot consent to serious bodily harm
assault in ancient greece was normally termed hubris
contrary to modern usage the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride self confidence or arrogance often resulting in fatal retribution
in ancient greece hubris referred to actions which intentionally or not shamed and humiliated the victim and frequently the perpetrator as well
it was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich
violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities or the theft of public or sacred property
two well known cases are found in the speeches of demosthenes a prominent statesman and orator in ancient greece
these two examples occurred when first in addition to other acts of violence meidias allegedly punched demosthenes in the face in the theater and second when the defendant allegedly severely beat him
hubris though not specifically defined was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical athens
it was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient greek world
that was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved
the category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse or a humiliation of a defeated foe or irreverent outrageous treatment in general
the meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern english usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws
such an act may be referred to as an act of hubris or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic
at greek for ruin folly delusion is the action performed by the hero usually because of their hubris or great pride that leads to their death or downfall
crucial to this definition are the ancient greek concepts of honor and shame
the concept of tim included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris
this concept of honor is akin to a zero sum game
rush rehm simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of insolence contempt and excessive violence
the indian penal code covers the punishments and types of assault in chapter sections through
the code further explains that mere words do not amount to an assault
but the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault
assault is in indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force
the attempt itself has been made an offence in india as in other states
the criminal code act creates a number of offences of assault
assault is defined by section of that act
assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her or who indecently assaults another or who commits other more serious variants of assault are guilty of a felony and longer prison terms are provided for
marshall islands the offence of assault is created by section of the criminal code
a person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt with force or violence to strike beat wound or do bodily harm to another
section of the non fatal offences against the person act creates the offence of assault and section of that act creates the offence of assault causing harm
south african law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery
assault is a common law crime defined as unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him
the law also recognises the crime of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm where grievous bodily harm is defined as harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health
the common law crime of indecent assault was repealed by the criminal law amendment act and replaced by a statutory crime of sexual assault
english law provides for two offences of assault common assault and battery
assault is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence
violence in this context means any unlawful touching though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile
the terms assault and common assault often encompass the separate offence of battery even in statutory settings such as section of the criminal justice act
a common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty
section of the criminal justice act provides that common assault like battery is triable only in a magistrates court in england and wales
additionally if a defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm or racially religiously aggravated assault then a jury in the crown court may acquit the defendant of the more serious offence but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed
an assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing actual bodily harm or in the severest cases grievous bodily harm
in scots law assault is defined as an attack upon the person of another
there is no distinction made in scotland between assault and battery although as in england and wales assault can be occasioned without a physical attack on anothers person as demonstrated in atkinson v
hm advocate wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter while wearing a ski mask
the court said scots law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury the use of a weapon or hamesucken
the mens rea for assault is simply evil intent although this has been held to mean no more than that assault cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently as upheld in lord advocates reference no of where it was found that a hold up in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence
it is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty under section of the police and fire reform act act which provides that it is an offence for a person to amongst other things assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty
several offences of assault exist in northern ireland
the offences against the person act creates the offences of that act formerly created the offence of assault on a constable in the execution of his duty
under section but that section has been superseded by section of the police act which now provides that it is an offence for a person to amongst other things assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty
in the united states assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a battery
however the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended but the defendants act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur
as the criminal law evolved element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice
these four elements were eventually codified in most states
the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be a natural person
thus unless the attack is directed by a person an animal attack does not constitute an assault
however under limited circumstances the unborn victims of violence act of treats a fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes
laws on assault vary by state
since each state has its own criminal laws there is no universal assault law
acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery menacing intimidation reckless endangerment etc
in another state
assault is often subdivided into two categories simple assault and aggravated assault
in some states consent is a complete defense to assault
in other jurisdictions mutual consent is an incomplete defense to an assault charge such that an assault charge is prosecuted as a less significant offense such as a petty misdemeanor
states vary on whether it is possible to commit an attempted assault since it can be considered a double inchoate offense
in new york state assault requires an actual injury
other states define this as battery there is no crime of battery in new york
however in new york if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact that is called menacing
a person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree if they have a previous conviction for the same offense
new york also has specific laws against hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization
a person convicted of simple assault can be ordered to up to two years in prison as a second degree misdemeanor
a person convicted of aggravated assault can face up to years in prison as a second degree felony
however if the crime is perpetrated against a firefighter or police officer the offender may face first degree felony charges carrying a penalty of up to years in prison
in norse cosmology lfheimr also called ljslfheimr is home of the light elves
lfheim as an abode of the elves is mentioned only twice in old norse texts
a tooth gift is a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth
in norse mythology ask and embla man and woman respectively were the first two humans created by the gods
the pair are attested in both the poetic edda compiled in the th century from earlier traditional sources and the prose edda composed in the th century
in both sources three gods one of whom is odin find ask and embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts
a number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures and there are occasional references to them in popular culture
old norse literally means ash tree but the etymology of embla is uncertain and two possibilities of the meaning of embla are generally proposed
the first meaning elm tree is problematic and is reached by deriving elm la from almiln and subsequently to
the second suggestion is vine which is reached through ambil which may be related to the greek term itself meaning vine liana
the latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories
linguist gunlg josefsson claims that the name embla comes from the roots which would mean firemaker or smokebringer inflected for either gender
she connects this to the ancient practice of creating fire through a fire plough which was considered a magical and holy way of fire making in folk belief in scandinavia long into modern times
she identifies the emergence of fire through the plowing symbolically to the moment of orgasm and hence fertilization and reproduction
according to benjamin thorpe grimm says the word embla emla signifies a busy woman from amr ambr aml ambl assiduous labour the same relation as meshia and meshiane the ancient persian names of the first man and woman who were also formed from trees
in stanza of the poetic edda poem the seeress reciting the poem states that hnir lurr and odin once found ask and embla on land
the seeress says that the two were capable of very little lacking in and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods the meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary
according to chapter of the prose edda book the three brothers vili v and odin are the creators of the first man and woman
the brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there
they took the wood and from it created the first human beings ask and embla
one of the three gave them the breath of life the second gave them movement and intelligence and the third gave them shape speech hearing and sight
further the three gods gave them clothing and names
ask and embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of midgard
a proto indo european basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of embla meaning vine
in indo european societies an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and sexual intercourse
vines were used as a flammable wood where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood resulting in fire
further evidence of ritual making of fire in scandinavia has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a bronze age grave in kivik scania sweden

in indo european tradition these range from the vedic yama and yam and the iranian maya and maynag to the icelandic askr and embla with trees or rocks as preferred raw material and dragons teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure
in his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in indo european society anders hultgrd observes that myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient europe and indo europe and indo european speaking peoples of asia minor and iran
by contrast the cultures of the near east show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive mans origin from clay earth or blood by means of a divine creation act
two wooden figures the braak bog figures of more than human height were unearthed from a peat bog at braak in schleswig germany
the figures depict a nude man and a nude woman
hilda ellis davidson comments that these figures may represent a lord and lady of the vanir a group of norse gods and that another memory of wooden deities may survive in the tradition of the creation of ask and embla the man and woman who founded the human race created by the gods from trees on the seashore
a figure named sc appears as the son of hengest in the anglo saxon genealogy for the kings of kent
this has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre norse germanic mythology
connections have been proposed between ask and embla and the vandal kings assi and ambri attested in paul the deacons th century ad work origo gentis langobardorum
there the two ask the god godan for victory
the name ambri like embla likely derives from ambil
a stanza preceding the account of the creation of ask and embla in vlusp provides a catalog of dwarfs and stanza has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth
this may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans and that the three gods gave them life
carolyne larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in old norse works due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees ask and embla
ask and embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions

it is later revealed both kingdoms are named after a pair of ancient dragons with askr being male and embla female
in the videogame valheim the developers named an armor set after embla as stated in their development blog entry on november we have named this set after one of the two first humans in norse mythology embla
the alabama river in the us state of alabama is formed by the tallapoosa and coosa rivers which unite about north of montgomery near the town of wetumpka
the river flows west to selma then southwest until about from mobile it unites with the tombigbee forming the mobile and tensaw rivers which discharge into mobile bay
the run of the alabama is highly meandering
its width varies from and its depth from
its length as measured by the united states geological survey is and by steamboat measurement
the river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state
railways connect it with the mineral regions of north central alabama
after the coosa and tallapoosa rivers the principal tributary of the alabama is the cahaba river which is about long and joins the alabama river about below selma
the alabama rivers main tributary the coosa river crosses the mineral region of alabama and is navigable for light draft boats from rome georgia to about above wetumpka and from wetumpka to its junction with the tallapoosa
the channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government
the navigation of the tallapoosa river which has its source in paulding county georgia and is about long is prevented by shoals and a fall at tallassee a few miles north of its junction with the coosa
the alabama is navigable throughout the year
the river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the th century as a source of transportation of goods which included slaves
the river is still used for transportation of farming produce however it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways
documented by europeans first in the alabama coosa and tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the creek indians before their removal by united states forces to the indian territory in the s
the alabama river has three lock and dams between montgomery and the mobile river
the robert f
henry lock dam is located at river mile the millers ferry lock dam is located at river mile and the claiborne lock dam is located at river mile alain de lille was a french theologian and poet
he was born in lille some time before
his exact date of death remains unclear as well with most research pointing toward it being between april and april
he is known for writing a number of works on that are based upon the teachings of the liberal arts with one of his most renowned poems de planctu naturae focusing on sexual conduct among humans
although alain was widely known during his lifetime little is known about his personal life
as a theologian alain de lille opposed scholasticism in the second half of the th century
his philosophy is characterized by rationalism and mysticism
alan claimed that reason guided by prudence could discover most truths about the physical order without help but in order to understand religious truth and to know god the wise must be believers
little is known of his life
alain entered the schools no earlier than the late s first attending the school at paris and then at chartres
he probably studied under masters such as peter abelard gilbert of poitiers and thierry of chartres
this is known through the writings of john of salisbury who is thought to have been a contemporary student of alain of lille
his earliest writings were probably written in the s and probably in paris
alain spent many years as a professor of theology at the university of paris and he attended the lateran council in
though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in paris and taught there as well as some time in southern france into his old age
he afterwards inhabited montpellier lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister and finally retired to cteaux where he died in
he had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge caused him to be called doctor universalis
many of alains writings cannot be exactly dated and the circumstances surrounding his writing are often unknown as well
it does seem clear that his first notable work summa quoniam homines was completed between and with the most conclusive date being and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in paris
among his numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the latin literature of the middle ages one of these the de planctu naturae is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity
he created the allegory of grammatical conjugation which was to have its successors throughout the middle ages
the anticlaudianus a treatise on morals as allegory the form of which recalls the pamphlet of claudian against rufinus is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity
as a theologian alain de lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the th century against the scholastic philosophy
his mysticism however is far from being as absolute as that of the victorines
in the anticlaudianus he sums up as follows reason guided by prudence can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith
this rule is completed in his treatise ars catholicae fidei as follows theology itself may be demonstrated by reason
alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the christian creed
this bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection that gives his treatise its apparent originality
alans philosophy was a sort of mixture of aristotelian logic and neoplatonic philosophy
the platonist seemed to outweigh the aristotelian in alan but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much aristotelian logic combined with pythagorean mathematics
one of alains most notable works was one he modeled after boethius consolation of philosophy to which he gave the title de planctu naturae or the plaint of nature and which was most likely written in the late s
in this work alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of god
he also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality has defiled itself from nature and god
in anticlaudianus another of his notable works alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man
she has only the ability to create a soulless body and thus she is persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul and the seven liberal arts produce a chariot for her
the five senses are the horses
the anticlaudianus was translated into french and german in the following century and toward was re worked into a musical anthology by adam de la basse
one of alans most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching ars praedicandi or the art of preaching
this work shows how alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be used as a practical manual when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching
alain wrote three very large theological textbooks one being his first work summa quoniam homines
another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus is his de fide catholica dated somewhere between and alan sets out to refute heretical views specifically that of the waldensians and cathars
in his third theological textbook regulae caelestis iuris he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules this was typical of the followers of gilbert of poitiers of which alan could be associated
other than these theological textbooks and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry alan of lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects primarily including speculative theology theoretical moral theology practical moral theology and various collections of poems
alain de lille has often been confounded with other persons named alain in particular with another alanus alan abbot of tewkesbury alain de podio etc
certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him as well as some of their works thus the life of st bernard should be ascribed to alain of auxerre and the commentary upon merlin to alan of tewkesbury
alan of lille was not the author of a memoriale rerum difficilium published under his name nor of moralium dogma philosophorum nor of the satirical apocalypse of golias once attributed to him and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the dicta alani de lapide philosophico really issued from his pen
on the other hand it now seems practically demonstrated that alain de lille was the author of the ars catholicae fidei and the treatise contra haereticos
in his sermons on capital sins alain argued that sodomy and homicide are the most serious sins since they call forth the wrath of god which led to the destruction of sodom and gomorrah
his chief work on penance the liber poenitenitalis dedicated to henry de sully exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the fourth lateran council
alains identification of the sins against nature included bestiality masturbation oral and anal intercourse incest adultery and rape
in addition to his battle against moral decay alan wrote a work against islam judaism and christian heretics dedicated to william viii of montpellier
the alemanni or alamanni were a confederation of germanic tribes on the upper rhine river during the first millennium
first mentioned by cassius dio in the context of the campaign of roman emperor caracalla of the alemanni captured the in and later expanded into present day alsace and northern switzerland leading to the establishment of the old high german language in those regions which by the eighth century were collectively referred to as alamannia
in the alemanni were conquered by the frankish leader clovis and incorporated into his dominions
mentioned as still pagan allies of the christian franks the alemanni were gradually christianized during the seventh century
the is a record of their customary law during this period
until the eighth century frankish suzerainty over alemannia was mostly nominal
after an uprising by theudebald duke of alamannia however carloman executed the alamannic nobility and installed frankish dukes
during the later and weaker years of the carolingian empire the alemannic counts became almost independent and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the bishopric of constance
the chief family in alamannia was that of the counts of who were sometimes called margraves and one of whom burchard ii established the duchy of swabia which was recognized by henry the fowler in and became a stem duchy of the holy roman empire
the area settled by the alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where alemannic german dialects remain spoken including german swabia and baden french alsace german speaking switzerland liechtenstein and austrian vorarlberg
the french language name of germany is derived from their name from old french aleman and from french was loaned into a number of other languages including middle english which commonly used the term almains for germans
likewise the arabic name for germany is the turkish is almanya the spanish is alemania the portuguese is alemanha the welsh is yr almaen and the persian is
according to gaius asinius quadratus the name alamanni means all men
it indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various germanic tribes
the romans and the greeks called them as such
this derivation was accepted by edward gibbon in his decline and fall of the roman empire and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of nicolas frret published in
this etymology has remained the standard derivation of the name
an alternative suggestion proposes derivation from alah sanctuary
walafrid strabo in the ninth century remarked in discussing the people of switzerland and the surrounding regions that only foreigners called them the alemanni but that they gave themselves the name of suebi
the suebi are given the alternative name of ziuwari in an old high german gloss interpreted by jacob grimm as martem colentes
annio da viterbo a scholar and historian of the th century claimed the alemanni had their name from the hebrew language as in hebrew the river rhine was translated into mannum and the people who live at its shores were called alemannus
this was refuted by beatus rhenanus a humanist of the th century
rhenanus argued the term alemanni was meant for the whole germanic people only in late antiquity and before it was only meant to designate the population of an island in the north sea
early roman writers did not mention the alemanni and it is likely that they had not yet come to exist
in his germania tacitus does not mention the alemanni
he uses the term agri decumates to describe the region between the rhine main and danube rivers
he says that it had once been the home of the helvetians who had moved westwards into gaul in the time of julius caesar
the people living there in caesars time are not germanic
instead reckless adventurers from gaul emboldened by want occupied this land of questionable ownership
after a while our frontier having been advanced and our military positions pushed forward it was regarded as a remote nook of our empire and a part of a roman province
the alemanni were first mentioned by cassius dio describing the campaign of caracalla in
at that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the main to the south of the chatti
cassius dio portrays the alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor
they had asked for his help according to dio but instead he colonized their country changed their place names and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid
when he became ill the alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him
caracalla it was claimed tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits
in retribution caracalla then led the legio ii traiana fortis against the alemanni who lost and were pacified for a time
the legion was as a result honored with the name germanica
the fourth century fictional historia augusta life of antoninus caracalla relates that caracalla then assumed the name alemannicus at which helvius pertinax jested that he should really be called geticus maximus because in the year before he had murdered his brother geta
through much of his short reign caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations
if he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries
whether or not the alemanni had been previously neutral they were certainly further influenced by caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of rome
this mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the roman writers persisted in calling the alemanni barbari meaning savages
the archaeology however shows that they were largely romanized lived in roman style houses and used roman artifacts the alemannic women having adopted the roman fashion of the tunica even earlier than the men
most of the alemanni were probably at the time in fact resident in or close to the borders of germania superior
although dio is the earliest writer to mention them ammianus marcellinus used the name to refer to germans on the limes germanicus in the time of trajans governorship of the province shortly after it was formed around ad
at that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time
trees from the earliest fortifications found in germania inferior are dated by dendrochronology to ad
ammianus relates that much later the emperor julian undertook a punitive expedition against the alemanni who by then were in alsace and crossed the main entering the forest where the trails were blocked by felled trees
as winter was upon them they reoccupied a fortification which was founded on the soil of the alemanni that trajan wished to be called with his own name
in this context the use of alemanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that ammianus believed they were the same people which is consistent with the location of the alemanni of caracallas campaigns
the alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the roman empire in the third and fourth centuries
they launched a major invasion of gaul and northern italy in when the romans were forced to denude much of their german frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the goths from the east
their raids throughout the three parts of gaul were traumatic gregory of tours mentions their destructive force at the time of valerian and gallienus when the alemanni assembled under their king whom he calls chrocus who acted by the advice it is said of his wicked mother and overran the whole of the gauls and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times
and coming to clermont he set on fire overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call vasso galatae in the gallic tongue martyring many christians
thus sixth century gallo romans of gregorys class surrounded by the ruins of roman temples and public buildings attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the alemanni
in the early summer of the emperor gallienus halted their advance into italy but then had to deal with the goths
when the gothic campaign ended in roman victory at the battle of naissus in september gallienus successor claudius gothicus turned north to deal with the alemanni who were swarming over all italy north of the po river
after efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed claudius forced the alemanni to battle at the battle of lake benacus in november
the alemanni were routed forced back into germany and did not threaten roman territory for many years afterwards
their most famous battle against rome took place in argentoratum in where they were defeated by julian later emperor of rome and their king chnodomarius was taken prisoner to rome
on january the alemanni yet again crossed the frozen rhine in large numbers to invade the gallic provinces this time being defeated by valentinian
in the great mixed invasion of the alemanni appear to have crossed the rhine river a final time conquering and then settling what is today alsace and a large part of the swiss plateau
the crossing is described in wallace breems historical novel eagle in the snow
the chronicle of fredegar gives the account
at alba augusta the devastation was so complete that the christian bishop retired to viviers but in gregorys account at mende in lozre also deep in the heart of gaul bishop privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated
it is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence
the kingdom of alamannia between strasbourg and augsburg lasted until when the alemanni were conquered by clovis i at the battle of tolbiac
the war of clovis with the alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of clovis briefly treated by gregory of tours
after their defeat in the alemanni bucked the frankish yoke and put themselves under the protection of theodoric the great of the ostrogoths but after his death they were again subjugated by the franks under theudebert i in
subsequently the alemanni formed part of the frankish dominions and were governed by a frankish duke
in carloman ended an uprising by summarily executing all alemannic nobility at the blood court at cannstatt and for the following century alemannia was ruled by frankish dukes
following the treaty of verdun of alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of louis the german the precursor of the holy roman empire
the duchy persisted until
the german spoken today over the range of the former alemanni is termed alemannic german and is recognised among the subgroups of the high german languages
alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the pforzen buckle are among the earliest testimonies of old high german
the high german consonant shift is thought to have originated around the fifth century either in alemannia or among the lombards before that the dialect spoken by alemannic tribes was little different from that of other west germanic peoples
alemannia lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when charles martel absorbed it into the frankish empire early in the eighth century
today alemannic is a linguistic term referring to alemannic german encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of baden wrttemberg in western bavaria in vorarlberg swiss german in switzerland and the alsatian language of the alsace
the alemanni established a series of territorially defined pagi on the east bank of the rhine
the exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time
pagi usually pairs of pagi combined formed kingdoms which it is generally believed were permanent and hereditary
ammianus describes alemanni rulers with various terms reges excelsiores ante alios reges proximi reguli and regales
this may be a formal hierarchy or they may be vague overlapping terms or a combination of both
in there appear to have been two paramount kings who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings
their territories were small and mostly strung along the rhine
it is possible that the reguli were the rulers of the two pagi in each kingdom
underneath the royal class were the nobles and warriors
the warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men
each nobleman could raise an average of c
the christianization of the alemanni took place during merovingian times
we know that in the sixth century the alemanni were predominantly pagan and in the eighth century they were predominantly christian
the intervening seventh century was a period of genuine syncretism during which christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence
some scholars have speculated that members of the alemannic elite such as king gibuld due to visigothic influence may have been converted to arianism even in the later fifth century
in the mid th century the byzantine historian agathias records in the context of the wars of the goths and franks against byzantium that the alemanni fighting among the troops of frankish king theudebald were like the franks in all respects except religion since he also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the alemanni in destroying christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries
agathias expresses his hope that the alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the franks which is by all appearances in a manner of speaking what eventually happened
apostles of the alemanni were columbanus and his disciple saint gall
jonas of bobbio records that columbanus was active in bregenz where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to wodan
despite these activities for some time the alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities with only superficial or syncretistic christian elements
in particular there is no change in burial practice and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout merovingian times
syncretism of traditional germanic animal style with christian symbolism is also present in artwork but christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the seventh century
unlike the later christianization of the saxons and of the slavs the alemanni seem to have adopted christianity gradually and voluntarily spread in emulation of the merovingian elite
from c
the s to the s there was a surge of alemannic elder futhark inscriptions
about specimens have survived roughly half of them on fibulae others on belt buckles and other jewelry and weapon parts
use of runes subsides with the advance of christianity
the nordendorf fibula clearly records pagan theonyms logaorewodanwigionar read as wodan and donar are magicians sorcerers but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities or a christian protective charm against them
a runic inscription on a fibula found at bad ems reflects christian pious sentiment reading god fura dih deofile
dated to between ad and it marks the end of the native alemannic tradition of runic literacy
bad ems is in rhineland palatinate on the northwestern boundary of alemannic settlement where frankish influence would have been strongest
the establishment of the bishopric of konstanz cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by columbanus himself
in any case it existed by when gunzo appointed john of grab bishop
constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands and did not look back on late roman church history unlike the raetian bishopric of chur and basel
the establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history
in the early seventh century pactus alamannorum hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church while lantfrids lex alamannorum of has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone
a genetic study published in science advances in september examined the remains of eight individuals buried at a seventh century alemannic graveyard in niederstotzingen germany
this is the richest and most complete alemannic graveyard ever found
the highest ranking individual at the graveyard was a male with frankish grave goods
four males were found to be closely related to him
they were all carriers of types of the paternal haplogroup rbaaacbb
a sixth male was a carrier of the paternal haplogroup rbaaacbba and the maternal haplogroup uaa
along with the five closely related individuals he displayed close genetic links to northern and eastern europe particularly lithuania and iceland
two individuals buried at the cemetery were found to be genetically different from both the others and each other displaying genetic links to southern europe particularly northern italy and spain
along with the sixth male they might have been adoptees or slaves
nyse american formerly known as the american stock exchange and more recently as nyse mkt is an american stock exchange situated in new york city
amex was previously a mutual organization owned by its members
until it was known as the new york curb exchange
nyse euronext acquired amex on october with amex integrated with the alternext european small cap exchange and renamed the nyse alternext us in march nyse alternext us was changed to nyse amex equities
on may nyse amex equities changed its name to nyse mkt llc
following the sec approval of competing stock exchange iex in nyse mkt rebranded as nyse american and introduced a microsecond delay in trading referred to as a speed bump which is also present on the iex
the exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on broad street in manhattan
efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the th century under emanuel s
mendels and carl h
the curb brokers had been kicked out of the mills building front by and had moved to the pavement outside the blair building where cabbies lined up
there they were given a little domain of asphalt fenced off by the police on broad street between exchange place and beaver street
as of the curb market operated starting at am each day except sundays until a gong at pm
orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage
as of e
mendels gave the brokers rules by right of seniority but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing
according to the times this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships
however in the new york curb market agency was established which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers organized by mendels
the informal curb association formed in to weed out undesirables
the curb exchange was for years at odds with the new york stock exchange or big board operating several buildings away
explained the new york times in the big board looked at the curb as a trading place for cats and dogs
on april however when the nyse abolished its unlisted department the nyse stocks made homeless by the abolition were refused domicile by the curb brokers on broad street until they had complied with the curb list of requirements
in mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the new york curb market association which can be considered the first formal constitution of american stock exchange
in journalist edwin c
hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower broad street was a roaring swirling whirlpool that tears control of a gold mine from an unlucky operator and pauses to auction a puppy dog
it is like nothing else under the astonished sky that is its only roof

the curb exchange soon became the leading international stock market and according to historian robert sobel had more individual foreign issues on its list than
all other american securities markets combined
edward reid mccormick was the first president of the new york curb market association and is credited with moving the market indoors
george rea was approached about the position of president of the new york curb exchange in
he was unanimously elected as the first paid president in the history of the curb exchange
he was paid per year and held the position for three years before offering his resignation in

saul who announced his resignation in march
in november kolton was named as the exchanges first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive
as chairman kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading
kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the new york stock exchange while he headed the exchange saying that two independent viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution
kolton announced in july that he would be leaving his position at the american exchange in november of that year

etfs or exchange traded funds had their genesis in with index participation shares an sp proxy that traded on the american stock exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange
this product was short lived after a lawsuit by the chicago mercantile exchange was successful in stopping sales in the united states
in a similar product toronto index participation shares which tracked the tse and later the tse indices started trading on the toronto stock exchange in
the popularity of these products led the american stock exchange to try to develop something that would satisfy regulations by the us securities and exchange commission
nathan most and steven bloom under the direction of ivers riley designed and developed standard poors depositary receipts which were introduced in january

alfred russel wallace was an english naturalist explorer geographer anthropologist biologist and illustrator
he independently conceived the theory of evolution through natural selection his paper on the subject was published that year alongside extracts from charles darwins earlier writings on the topic
it spurred darwin to set aside the big species book he was drafting and quickly write an abstract of it which was published in as on the origin of species
wallace did extensive fieldwork starting in the amazon river basin
he then did fieldwork in the malay archipelago where he identified the faunal divide now termed the wallace line which separates the indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts a western portion in which the animals are largely of asian origin and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect australasia
he was considered the th centurys leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the father of biogeography or more specifically of zoogeography
wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the th century working on warning coloration in animals and reinforcement a way that natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation
wallaces book mans place in the universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets
he was one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of whether there was life on mars
aside from scientific work he was a social activist critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system in th century britain
his advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with other scientists
he was one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity
he wrote prolifically on both scientific and social issues his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in southeast asia the malay archipelago was first published in
it continues to be both popular and highly regarded
alfred russel wallace was born on january in llanbadoc monmouthshire
he was the eighth of nine children born to mary anne wallace and thomas vere wallace
his mother was english while his father was of scottish ancestry
his family claimed a connection to william wallace a leader of scottish forces during the wars of scottish independence in the th century
wallaces father graduated in law but never practised it
he owned some income generating property but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the familys financial position
wallaces mother was from a middle class family of hertford to which place his family moved when wallace was five years old
he attended hertford grammar school until when he reached the age of the normal leaving age for a pupil not going on to university
wallace then moved to london to board with his older brother john a year old apprentice builder
this was a stopgap measure until william his oldest brother was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor
while in london alfred attended lectures and read books at the london mechanics institute
here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the welsh social reformer robert owen and of the english born political theorist thomas paine
he left london in to live with william and work as his apprentice for six years
they moved repeatedly to different places in mid wales
then at the end of they moved to kington herefordshire near the welsh border before eventually settling at neath in wales
between and wallace worked as a land surveyor in the countryside of the west of england and wales
the natural history of his surroundings aroused his interest from he collected flowers and plants as an amateur botanist
one result of wallaces early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality
since he was born in monmouthshire some sources have considered him to be welsh
other historians have questioned this because neither of his parents were welsh his family only briefly lived in monmouthshire the welsh people wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be english and because he consistently referred to himself as english rather than welsh
one wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an englishman born in wales
in wallaces father died and a decline in demand for surveying meant williams business no longer had work available
for a short time wallace was unemployed then early in he was engaged by the collegiate school in leicester to teach drawing mapmaking and surveying
he had already read george combes the constitution of man and after spencer hall lectured on mesmerism wallace as well as some of the older pupils tried it out
wallace spent many hours at the town library in leicester he read an essay on the principle of population by thomas robert malthus alexander von humboldts personal narrative darwins journal and charles lyells principles of geology
one evening wallace met the entomologist henry bates who was years old and had published an paper on beetles in the journal zoologist
he befriended wallace and started him collecting insects
when wallaces brother william died in march wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brothers firm in neath but his brother john and he were unable to make the business work
after a few months he found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the vale of neath
wallaces work on the survey was largely outdoors in the countryside allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects
wallace persuaded his brother john to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm
it carried out projects including the design of a building for the neath mechanics institute founded in
during this period he exchanged letters with bates about books
by the end of wallace was convinced by robert chamberss anonymously published treatise on progressive development vestiges of the natural history of creation but he found bates was more critical
wallace re read darwins journal and on april wrote as the journal of a scientific traveller it is second only to humboldts personal narrative as a work of general interest perhaps superior to it
william jevons the founder of the neath institute was impressed by wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering
in the autumn of wallace and his brother john purchased a cottage near neath where they lived with their mother and sister fanny
inspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists wallace decided to travel abroad
he later wrote that darwins journal and humboldts personal narrative were the two works to whose inspiration i owe my determination to visit the tropics as a collector
after reading a voyage up the river amazon by william henry edwards wallace and bates estimated that by collecting and selling natural history specimens such as birds and insects they could meet their costs with the prospect of good profits
they therefore engaged as their agent samuel stevens who would advertise and arrange sales to institutions and private collectors for a commission of on sales plus on despatching freight and remittances of money
in wallace and bates left for brazil aboard the mischief
they intended to collect insects and other animal specimens in the amazon rainforest for their private collections selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in britain to fund the trip
wallace hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species
bates and he spent most of their first year collecting near belm then explored inland separately occasionally meeting to discuss their findings
in they were briefly joined by another young explorer the botanist richard spruce along with wallaces younger brother herbert
herbert soon left but spruce like bates would spend over ten years collecting in south america
wallace spent four years charting the rio negro collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography flora and fauna
on july wallace embarked for the uk on the brig helen
after days at sea the ships cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship
all the specimens wallace had on the ship mostly collected during the last and most interesting two years of his trip were lost
he managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches but little else
wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig jordeson which was sailing from cuba to london
the jordeson provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers but after a difficult passage on short rations the ship reached its destination on october
the lost collection had been insured for by stevens
after his return to britain wallace spent months in london living on the insurance payment and selling a few specimens that had been shipped home
during this period despite having lost almost all the notes from his south american expedition he wrote six academic papers and two books palm trees of the amazon and their uses and travels on the amazon
at the same time he made connections with several other british naturalists
bates and others were collecting in the amazon area wallace was more interested in new opportunities in the malay archipelago as demonstrated by the travel writings of ida laura pfeiffer and valuable insect specimens she collected which stevens sold as her agent
in march wallace wrote to sir james brooke rajah of sarawak who was then in london and who arranged assistance in sarawak for wallace
in june wallace wrote to murchison at the royal geographical society for support proposing to again fund his exploring entirely from sale of duplicate collections
he later recalled that while researching in the insect room of the british museum he was introduced to darwin and they had a few minutes conversation
after presenting a paper and a large map of the rio negro to the rgs wallace was elected a fellow of the society on february
free passage arranged on royal navy ships was stalled by the crimean war but eventually the rgs funded first class travel by po steamships
wallace and a young assistant charles allen embarked at southampton on march
after the overland journey to suez and another change of ship at ceylon they disembarked at singapore on april
from to wallace travelled around the islands of the malay archipelago or east indies
his main objective was to obtain specimens of natural history both for my private collection and to supply duplicates to museums and amateurs
in addition to allen he generally employed one or two and sometimes three malay servants as assistants and paid large numbers of local people at various places to bring specimens
his total was specimens most of which were insects including more than beetles several thousand of the specimens represented species new to science overall more than thirty men worked for him at some stage as full time paid collectors
he also hired guides porters cooks and boat crews so well over individuals worked for him
after collecting expeditions to bukit timah hill in singapore and to malacca wallace and allen reached sarawak in october and were welcomed at kuching by sir james brookes heir captain john brooke
wallace hired a malay named ali as a general servant and cook and spent the early wet season in a small dyak house at the foot of mount santubong overlooking a branch outlet of the sarawak river
he read about species distribution notes on pictetss palaeontology and wrote his sarawak paper
in march he moved to the simunjon coal works operated by the borneo company under ludvig verner helms and supplemented collecting by paying workers a cent for each insect
a specimen of the previously unknown gliding tree frog rhacophorus nigropalmatus came from a chinese workman who told wallace that it glided down
local people also assisted with shooting orangutans
they spent time with sir james then in february allen chose to stay on with the missionaries at kuching
on reaching singapore in may wallace hired a bird skinner
with ali as cook they collected for two days on bali then from june to august on lombok
in december darwin had written to contacts worldwide to get specimens for his continuing research into variation under domestication
at lomboks port city ampanam wallace wrote telling his agent stevens about specimens shipped including a domestic duck variety for mr darwin he would perhaps also like the jungle cock which is often domesticated here is doubtless one of the originals of the domestic breed of poultry
in the same letter wallace said birds from bali and lombok divided by a narrow strait belong to two quite distinct zoological provinces of which they form the extreme limits java borneo sumatra and malacca and australia and the moluccas
stevens arranged publication of relevant paragraphs in the january issue of the zoologist
after further investigation the zoogeographical boundary eventually became known as the wallace line
ali became wallaces most trusted assistant a skilled collector and researcher
wallace collected and preserved the delicate insect specimens while most of the birds were collected and prepared by his assistants of those ali collected and prepared around
while exploring the archipelago wallace refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection
in he sent an article outlining his theory to darwin it was published along with a description of darwins theory that same year
accounts of wallaces studies and adventures were eventually published in as the malay archipelago
this became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the th century and has never been out of print
it was praised by scientists such as darwin by lyell and by non scientists such as the novelist joseph conrad
conrad called the book his favorite bedside companion and used information from it for several of his novels especially lord jim
a set of bird skeletons wallace collected in indonesia are held in the cambridge university museum of zoology and described as of exceptional historical significance
in wallace returned to britain where he moved in with his sister fanny sims and her husband thomas
while recovering from his travels wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the zoological society of london
later that year he visited darwin at down house and became friendly with both lyell and the philosopher herbert spencer
during the s wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection
he corresponded with darwin about topics including sexual selection warning coloration and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species
in he began investigating spiritualism
after a year of courtship wallace became engaged in to a young woman whom in his autobiography he would only identify as miss l
miss l
was the daughter of lewis leslie who played chess with wallace but to wallaces great dismay she broke off the engagement
in wallace married annie mitten
wallace had been introduced to mitten through the botanist richard spruce who had befriended wallace in brazil and who was a friend of annie mittens father william mitten an expert on mosses
in wallace built the dell a house of concrete on land he leased in grays in essex where he lived until
the wallaces had three children herbert violet and william
in the late s and s wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family
while he was in the malay archipelago the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for wallace
on his return to the uk wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of the malay archipelago
despite assistance from his friends he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum
to remain financially solvent wallace worked grading government examinations wrote papers for publication between and for various modest sums and was paid by lyell and darwin to help edit some of their works
in wallace needed a advance from the publisher of the geographical distribution of animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property
darwin was very aware of wallaces financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science
when the annual pension was awarded in it helped to stabilise wallaces financial position by supplementing the income from his writings
in wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed land nationalisation society
in the next year he published a book land nationalisation its necessity and its aims on the subject
he criticised the uks free trade policies for the negative impact they had on working class people
in wallace read looking backward by edward bellamy and declared himself a socialist despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor
after reading progress and poverty the bestselling book by the progressive land reformist henry george wallace described it as undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century
wallace opposed eugenics an idea supported by other prominent th century evolutionary thinkers on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit
in his article human selection he wrote those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent
he said the world does not want the eugenicist to set it straight give the people good conditions improve their environment and all will tend towards the highest type
eugenics is simply the meddlesome interference of an arrogant scientific priestcraft
in wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system not backed by silver or gold which impressed the economist irving fisher so much that he dedicated his book stabilizing the dollar to wallace
wallace wrote on other social and political topics including in support of womens suffrage and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism
in an essay he called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people that all modern wars are dynastic that they are caused by the ambition the interests the jealousies and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers and that the results of war are never good for the people who yet bear all its burthens
in a letter published by the daily mail in with aviation in its infancy he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft arguing against the idea that this new horror is inevitable and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of say ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemys capital from an invisible flight of airships
in wallace published the wonderful century its successes and its failures about developments in the th century
the first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century the second part covered what wallace considered to be its social failures including the destruction and waste of wars and arms races the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums the environmental damage caused by capitalism and the evils of european colonialism
wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life publishing the book the revolt of democracy just weeks before his death
in he published island life as a sequel to the geographic distribution of animals
in november wallace began a ten month trip to the united states to give a series of popular lectures
most of the lectures were on darwinism but he also gave speeches on biogeography spiritualism and socio economic reform
during the trip he was reunited with his brother john who had emigrated to california years before
he spent a week in colorado with the american botanist alice eastwood as his guide exploring the flora of the rocky mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of europe asia and north america which he published in in the paper english and american flowers
he met many other prominent american naturalists and viewed their collections
his book darwinism used information he collected on his american trip and information he had compiled for the lectures
on november wallace died at home aged in the country house he called old orchard which he had built a decade earlier
his death was widely reported in the press
the new york times called him the last of the giants to that wonderful group of intellectuals composed of darwin huxley spencer lyell owen and other scientists whose daring investigations revolutionized and evolutionized the thought of the century
another commentator in the same edition said no apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the malay archipelago
some of wallaces friends suggested that he be buried in westminster abbey but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at broadstone dorset
several prominent british scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of wallace placed in westminster abbey near where darwin had been buried
the medallion was unveiled on november
wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist who already believed in the transmutation of species
the concept had been advocated by jean baptiste lamarck geoffroy saint hilaire erasmus darwin and robert grant among others
it was widely discussed but not generally accepted by leading naturalists and was considered to have radical even revolutionary connotations
prominent anatomists and geologists such as georges cuvier richard owen adam sedgwick and lyell attacked transmutation vigorously
it has been suggested that wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics religion and science and because he was unusually open to marginal even fringe ideas in science
wallace was profoundly influenced by robert chamberss vestiges of the natural history of creation a controversial work of popular science published anonymously in
it advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system the earth and living things
wallace wrote to henry bates in describing it as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies but which remains to be proven by
more research
in he wrote to bates that he would like to take some one family beetles to study thoroughly
with a view to the theory of the origin of species
wallace planned fieldwork to test the evolutionary hypothesis that closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories
during his work in the amazon basin he came to realise that geographical barriers such as the amazon and its major tributaries often separated the ranges of closely allied species
he included these observations in his paper on the monkeys of the amazon
near the end of the paper he asked the question are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country in february while working in sarawak on the island of borneo wallace wrote on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species
the paper was published in the annals and magazine of natural history in september
in this paper he discussed observations of the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species a field that became biogeography
his conclusion that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species has come to be known as the sarawak law answering his own question in his paper on the monkeys of the amazon basin
although it does not mention possible mechanisms for evolution this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later
the paper challenged lyells belief that species were immutable
although darwin had written to him in expressing support for transmutation lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea
around the start of he told darwin about wallaces paper as did edward blyth who thought it good upon the whole
wallace has i think put the matter well and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species
despite this hint darwin mistook wallaces conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time writing that it was nothing very new
uses my simile of tree it seems all creation with him
lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species in which he grappled with the consequences particularly for human ancestry
darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend joseph hooker and now for the first time spelt out the full details of natural selection to lyell
although lyell could not agree he urged darwin to publish to establish priority
darwin demurred at first but began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in may
by february wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the malay archipelago that evolution was real
he later wrote in his autobiography that the problem was of how species change from one well marked form to another
he stated that it was while he was in bed with a fever that he thought about malthuss idea of positive checks on human population and had the idea of natural selection
his autobiography says that he was on the island of ternate at the time but the evidence of his journal suggests that he was in fact on the island of gilolo
from to he rented a house on ternate from the dutchman maarten dirk van renesse van duivenbode which he used as a base for expeditions to other islands such as gilolo
wallace had once briefly met darwin and was one of the correspondents whose observations darwin used to support his own theories
although wallaces first letter to darwin has been lost wallace carefully kept the letters he received
in the first letter dated may darwin commented that wallaces letter of october which he had recently received as well as wallaces paper on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species of showed that they thought alike with similar conclusions and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time
the second letter dated december said how glad he was that wallace was theorising about distribution adding that without speculation there is no good and original observation but commented that i believe i go much further than you
wallace believed this and sent darwin his february essay on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type asking darwin to review it and pass it to charles lyell if he thought it worthwhile
although wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the malay archipelago the ternate essay was in a private letter
darwin received the essay on june
although the essay did not use darwins term natural selection it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures
in this sense it was very similar to the theory that darwin had worked on for years but had yet to publish
darwin sent the manuscript to charles lyell with a letter saying he could not have made a better short abstract even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters
he does not say he wishes me to publish but i shall of course at once write and offer to send to any journal
distraught about the illness of his baby son darwin put the problem to charles lyell and joseph hooker who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted darwins priority
wallaces essay was presented to the linnean society of london on july along with excerpts from an essay which darwin had disclosed privately to hooker in and a letter darwin had written to asa gray in
communication with wallace in the far off malay archipelago involved months of delay so he was not part of this rapid publication
wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact happy that he had been included at all and never expressed bitterness in public or in private
darwins social and scientific status was far greater than wallaces and it was unlikely that without darwin wallaces views on evolution would have been taken seriously
lyell and hookers arrangement relegated wallace to the position of co discoverer and he was not the social equal of darwin or the other prominent british natural scientists
all the same the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated wallace with the more famous darwin
this combined with darwins advocacy on his behalf would give wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community
the reaction to the reading was muted with the president of the linnean society remarking in may that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries but with darwins publication of on the origin of species later in its significance became apparent
when wallace returned to the uk he met darwin
although some of wallaces opinions in the ensuing years would test darwins patience they remained on friendly terms for the rest of darwins life
over the years a few people have questioned this version of events
in the early s two books one by arnold brackman and another by john langdon brooks suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob wallace of his proper credit but that darwin had actually stolen a key idea from wallace to finish his own theory
these claims have been examined and found unconvincing by a number of scholars
shipping schedules show that contrary to these accusations wallaces letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in darwins letter to lyell
after wallace returned to england in he became one of the staunchest defenders of darwins on the origin of species
in an incident in that particularly pleased darwin wallace published the short paper remarks on the rev
haughtons paper on the bees cell and on the origin of species
this rebutted a paper by a professor of geology at the university of dublin that had sharply criticised darwins comments in the origin on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection
an even longer defence was a article in the quarterly journal of science called creation by law
it reviewed george campbell the th duke of argylls book the reign of law which aimed to refute natural selection
after an meeting of the british science association wallace wrote to darwin complaining that there were no opponents left who know anything of natural history so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have
historians of science have noted that while darwin considered the ideas in wallaces paper to be essentially the same as his own there were differences
darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce whereas wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions leading populations in different locations to diverge
the historian of science peter j
bowler has suggested that in the paper he mailed to darwin wallace might have been discussing group selection
against this malcolm kottler showed that wallace was indeed discussing individual variation and selection
others have noted that wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism that kept species and varieties adapted to their environment
they point to a largely overlooked passage of wallaces famous paper in which he likened this principle
the centrifugal governor of the steam engine which checks and corrects any irregularities
the cybernetician and anthropologist gregory bateson observed in the s that although writing it only as an example wallace had probably said the most powerful thing thatd been said in the th century
bateson revisited the topic in his book mind and nature a necessary unity and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory
warning coloration was one of wallaces contributions to the evolutionary biology of animal coloration
in darwin wrote to wallace about a problem in explaining how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes
darwin had come to believe that many conspicuous animal colour schemes were due to sexual selection but he saw that this could not apply to caterpillars
wallace responded that he and bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste and that he had been told by john jenner weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable
since the moth was as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in daylight it seemed likely that the conspicuous colours served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection
darwin was impressed by the idea
at a later meeting of the entomological society wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic
in weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported wallaces idea
wallace attributed less importance than darwin to sexual selection
in his book tropical nature and other essays he wrote extensively about the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases darwin had attributed to sexual selection
he revisited the topic at length in his book darwinism
in he wrote a critical review in nature of his friend edward bagnall poultons the colours of animals which supported darwin on sexual selection attacking especially poultons claims on the aesthetic preferences of the insect world
in wallace wrote the book darwinism which explained and defended natural selection
in it he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation
thus it might contribute to the development of new species
he suggested the following scenario when two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point each adapted to particular conditions hybrid offspring would be less adapted than either parent form and so natural selection would tend to eliminate the hybrids
furthermore under such conditions natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species
this idea came to be known as the wallace effect later called reinforcement
wallace had suggested to darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as but had not worked it out to this level of detail
it continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity
in wallace published a paper the origin of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of natural selection applying the theory to humankind
darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject although thomas huxley had in evidence as to mans place in nature
wallace explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes
unlike some other darwinists including darwin himself he did not regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape
he saw the evolution of humans in two stages achieving a bipedal posture that freed the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain and the recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life
wallace seems to have been the first evolutionist to see that the human brain effectively made further specialisation of the body unnecessary
wallace wrote the paper for the anthropological society of london to address the debate between the supporters of monogenism the belief that all human races shared a common ancestor and were one species and the supporters of polygenism who held that different races had separate origins and were different species
wallaces anthropological observations of native americans in the amazon and especially his time living among the dayak people of borneo had convinced him that human beings were a single species with a common ancestor
he still felt that natural selection might have continued to act on mental faculties after the development of the different races and he did not dispute the nearly universal view among european anthropologists of the time that europeans were intellectually superior to other races
according to political scientist adam jones wallace found little difficulty in reconciling the extermination of native peoples with his progressive political views
in in the aforementioned paper he stated it is the same great law of the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life which leads to the inevitable extinction of all those low and mentally undeveloped populations with which europeans come in contact
he argued that the natives die out due to an unequal struggle
shortly afterwards wallace became a spiritualist
at about the same time he began to maintain that natural selection could not account for mathematical artistic or musical genius metaphysical musings or wit and humour
he stated that something in the unseen universe of spirit had interceded at least three times in history the creation of life from inorganic matter the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals and the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind
he believed that the of the universe was the development of the human spirit
while some historians have concluded that wallaces belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the higher functions of the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism other scholars have disagreed and some maintain that wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas
reaction to wallaces ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied
lyell endorsed wallaces views on human evolution rather than darwins
wallaces belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late th and early th centuries
all the same many including huxley hooker and darwin himself were critical of wallaces views
as the historian of science and sceptic michael shermer has stated wallaces views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging darwinian philosophy
these were that evolution was not teleological and that it was not anthropocentric
much later in his life wallace returned to these themes that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes
he set out his ideas in a magazine article entitled the world of life later expanded into a book of the same name
shermer commented that this anticipated ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from religious traditions throughout the th century
in many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of darwins own theory
in reality wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from darwins and was considered by many to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day whose ideas could not be ignored
one historian of science has pointed out that through both private correspondence and published works darwin and wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each others ideas and theories over an extended period
wallace is the most cited naturalist in darwins descent of man occasionally in strong disagreement
darwin and wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection and some of the factors responsible for it competition between species and geographical isolation
but wallace believed that evolution had a purpose in maintaining species fitness to their environment whereas darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process
scientific discoveries since the th century support darwins viewpoint by identifying additional mechanisms and triggers such as mutations triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals
wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life
by the s evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles but natural selection less so
wallaces darwinism was a response to the scientific critics of natural selection
of all wallaces books it is the most cited by scholarly publications
in at the urging of many of his friends including darwin philip sclater and alfred newton wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals
initial progress was slow in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux
he resumed the work in earnest in after the publication of a number of new works on classification
extending the system developed by sclater for birds which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution to cover mammals reptiles and insects as well wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions in use today
he discussed the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region
these factors included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges and the effects of periods of increased glaciation
he provided maps showing factors such as elevation of mountains depths of oceans and the character of regional vegetation that affected the distribution of animals
he summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions
the text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location
the resulting two volume work the geographical distribution of animals was published in and served as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next years
the book included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern species
for example he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the northern hemisphere migrating between north america and eurasia and then much more recently to south america after which the northern species became extinct leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in south america and southeast asia
wallace was very aware of and interested in the mass extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene
in the geographical distribution of animals he wrote we live in a zoologically impoverished world from which all the hugest and fiercest and strangest forms have recently disappeared
he added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions was glaciation but by the time he wrote world of life he had come to believe those extinctions were due to mans agency
in wallace published the book island life as a sequel to the geographical distribution of animals
it surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands
wallace classified islands into oceanic and two types of continental islands
oceanic islands in his view such as the galapagos and hawaiian islands formed in mid ocean and never part of any large continent
such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians and their inhabitants were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution
continental islands in his scheme were divided into those that were recently separated from a continent and those much less recently
wallace discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna
he discussed how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals such as the lemurs of madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas
he extensively discussed how changes of climate particularly periods of increased glaciation may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages
island life was considered a very important work at the time of its publication
it was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence
wallaces extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world
in tropical nature and other essays he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall
noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate he warned that the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in ceylon and india would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their impoverishment due to soil erosion
in island life wallace again mentioned deforestation and invasive species
on the impact of european colonisation on the island of saint helena he wrote that the island was now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile
he explained that the soil was protected by the islands vegetation once that was destroyed the soil was washed off the steep slopes by heavy tropical rain leaving bare rock or sterile clay
he attributed the irreparable destruction to feral goats introduced in
the islands forests were further damaged by the reckless waste of the east india company from which used the bark of valuable redwood and ebony trees for tanning leaving the wood to rot unused
wallaces comments on environment grew more urgent later in his career
in the world of life he wrote that people should view nature as invested with a certain sanctity to be used by us but not abused and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced
wallaces book mans place in the universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets
he concluded that the earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase
his treatment of mars in this book was brief and in wallace returned to the subject with the book is mars habitable to criticise the claims made by the american astronomer percival lowell that there were martian canals built by intelligent beings
wallace did months of research consulted various experts and produced his own scientific analysis of the martian climate and atmospheric conditions
he pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the martian atmosphere that lowells analysis of marss climate badly overestimated the surface temperature and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water let alone a planet girding irrigation system impossible
richard milner comments that wallace effectively debunked lowells illusionary network of martian canals
wallace became interested in the topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would be unique in the universe
wallace was an enthusiast of phrenology
early in his career he experimented with hypnosis then known as mesmerism managing to hypnotise some of his students in leicester
when he began these experiments the topic was very controversial early experimenters such as john elliotson had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment
wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and spiritualism arguing that one should not deny observations on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility
wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of possibly at the urging of his older sister fanny sims
after reviewing the literature and attempting to test what he witnessed at sances he came to believe in it
for the rest of his life he remained convinced that at least some sance phenomena were genuine despite accusations of fraud and evidence of trickery
one biographer suggested that the emotional shock when his first fiance broke their engagement contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism
other scholars have emphasised his desire to find scientific explanations for all phenomena
in wallace visited the spirit photographer frederick hudson
he declared that a photograph of him with his deceased mother was genuine
others reached a different conclusion hudsons photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in
wallaces public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the s damaged his scientific reputation
in he published the evidence he believed proved his position in on miracles and modern spiritualism
his attitude permanently strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as henry bates thomas huxley and even darwin
others such as the physiologist william benjamin carpenter and zoologist e
ray lankester became publicly hostile to wallace over the issue
wallace was heavily criticised by the press the lancet was particularly harsh
when in darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to wallace joseph hooker responded that wallace has lost caste considerably not only by his adhesion to spiritualism but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the british association brought about a discussion on spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings
this he is said to have done in an underhanded manner and i well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the ba council
hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request
in a flat earth proponent named john hampden offered a wager in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river canal or lake
wallace intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a stretch of canal
both objects were at the same height above the water and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well
when seen through the telescope one object appeared higher than the other showing the curvature of the earth
the judge for the wager the editor of field magazine declared wallace the winner but hampden refused to accept the result
he sued wallace and launched a campaign which persisted for several years of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief
wallace won multiple libel suits against hampden but the resulting litigation cost wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years
in the early s wallace joined the debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination
wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty but after studying statistics provided by anti vaccination activists he began to question the efficacy of vaccination
at the time the germ theory of disease was new and far from universally accepted
moreover no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked
wallace discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable in a few cases completely false statistics to support their arguments
always suspicious of authority wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation
another factor in wallaces thinking was his belief that because of the action of natural selection organisms were in a state of balance with their environment and that everything in nature served a useful purpose
wallace pointed out that vaccination which at the time was often unsanitary could be dangerous
in wallace gave evidence to a royal commission investigating the controversy
it found errors in his testimony including some questionable statistics
the lancet averred that wallace and other activists were being selective in their choice of statistics
the commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory though they recommended some changes in procedures to improve safety and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe
years later in wallace wrote a pamphlet vaccination a delusion its penal enforcement a crime attacking the commissions findings
it in turn was attacked by the lancet which stated that it repeated many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission
as a result of his writing wallace became a well known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist and was often sought out for his views
he became president of the anthropology section of the british association in and of the entomological society of london in
he was elected to the american philosophical society in
the british association elected him as head of its biology section in
he was elected to the royal society in
he was asked to chair the international congress of spiritualists meeting in london in
he received honorary doctorates and professional honours such the royal societys royal medal in and its darwin medal in and the order of merit in
wallaces fame faded quickly after his death
for a long time he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science
reasons for this lack of attention may have included his modesty his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas
the reason that the theory of evolution is popularly credited to darwin is likely the impact of darwins on the origin of species
recently wallace has become better known with the publication of at least five book length biographies and two anthologies of his writings published since
a web page dedicated to wallace scholarship is maintained at western kentucky university
in a book the environmentalist tim flannery argued that wallace was the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival and suggested that wallaces understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere should be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking
a collection of his medals including the order of merit were sold at auction for in
the natural history museum london co ordinated commemorative events for the wallace centenary worldwide in the wallace project in
on january his portrait was unveiled in the main hall of the museum by bill bailey a fervent admirer
bailey further championed wallace in his bbc two series bill baileys jungle hero
on november the th anniversary of wallaces death sir david attenborough unveiled a statue of wallace at the museum
the statue sculpted by anthony smith was donated by the a
wallace memorial fund
it depicts wallace as a young man collecting in the jungle
november marked the debut of the animated life of a
wallace a paper puppet animation film dedicated to wallaces centennial
in addition bailey unveiled a bust of wallace sculpted by felicity crawley in twyn square in usk monmouthshire in november
commemorations of the th anniversary of wallaces birth celebrated during the course of range from naturalist walk events to scientific congresses and presentations
a harvard museum of natural history event in april will also include a mixologist designed special cocktail to honor wallaces legacy
mount wallace in californias sierra nevada mountain range was named in his honour in
in a house at richard hale school was named after wallace
the alfred russel wallace building is a prominent feature of the glyntaff campus at the university of south wales by pontypridd with several teaching spaces and laboratories for science courses
the natural sciences building at swansea university and lecture theatre at cardiff university are named after him as are impact craters on mars and the moon
in the royal entomological society mounted a year long expedition to the dumoga bone national park in north sulawesi named project wallace
a group of indonesian islands is known as the wallacea biogeographical region in his honour and operation wallacea named after the region awards alfred russel wallace grants to undergraduate ecology students
several hundred species of plants and animals both living and fossil have been named after wallace such as the gecko cyrtodactylus wallacei and the freshwater stingray potamotrygon wallacei
more recently several new species have been named during the bicentenary year of wallaces birth including a large spider from peru linothele wallacei sherwood et al
and a south african weevil nama wallacei meregalli borovec
wallace was a prolific author
in historian of science michael shermer published a quantitative analysis of wallaces publications
he found that wallace had published full length books and at least shorter pieces of which were scientific papers
he further broke down the short pieces by their primary subjects were on biogeography and natural history were on evolutionary theory were social commentary were on anthropology and were on spiritualism and phrenology
an online bibliography of wallaces writings has more than entries
there is an extensive literature on wallace
recent books on him include the australian labor party also commonly known simply as labor or the labor party is the major centre left political party in australia and one of two major parties in australian politics along with the centre right liberal party of australia
the party has been in government since being elected at the federal election and with political branches in each state and territory they currently form government in new south wales queensland south australia victoria western australia the australian capital territory and the northern territory
as of tasmania is the only state or territory where labor forms the opposition
it is the oldest continuous political party in australian history being established on may at parliament house melbourne the meeting place of the first federal parliament
the alp was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the australian parliament in
it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in australia formally beginning in
colonial labour parties contested seats from and federal seats following federation at the federal election
the alp formed the worlds first labour party government and the worlds first democratic socialist or social democratic government at a national level
at the federal election labor was the first party in australia to win a majority in either house of the australian parliament
in every election since labor has either served as the governing party or the opposition
there have been labor prime ministers and periods of federal labor governments
of the major parties it is the older one among them since the liberal party was formed in
the labor party is often called the party of unions due to its close ties to the labour movement in australia with the majority of trade unions being affiliated with the labor party
the party is equally controlled by unions and rank and file party members through affiliated unions being granted of delegates at each state and national conference
at the federal and state colony level the australian labor party predates both the british labour party and the new zealand labour party in party formation government and policy implementation
internationally the alp is a member of the progressive alliance a network of progressive and social democratic parties having previously been a member of the socialist international
in standard australian english the word is spelt with a u
however the political party uses the spelling labor without a u
there was originally no standardised spelling of the partys name with labor and labour both in common usage
according to ross mcmullin who wrote an official history of the labor party the title page of the proceedings of the federal conference used the spelling labor in labour in and and then labor from onwards
in james catts put forward a motion at the federal conference that the name of the party be the australian labour party which was carried by votes to
a separate motion recommending state branches adopt the name was defeated
there was no uniformity of party names until when the federal party resolved that state branches should adopt the name australian labor party now spelt without a u
each state branch had previously used a different name due to their different origins
although the alp officially adopted the spelling without a u it took decades for the official spelling to achieve widespread acceptance
according to mcmullin the way the spelling of labor party was consolidated had more to do with the chap who ended up being in charge of printing the federal conference report than any other reason
some sources have attributed the official choice of labor to influence from king omalley who was born in the united states and was reputedly an advocate of spelling reform the spelling without a u is the standard form in american english
it has been suggested that the adoption of the spelling without a u signified one of the alps earliest attempts at modernisation and served the purpose of differentiating the party from the australian labour movement as a whole and distinguishing it from other british empire labour parties
the decision to include the word australian in the partys name rather than just labour party as in the united kingdom has been attributed to the greater importance of nationalism for the founders of the colonial parties
the australian labor party has its origins in the labour parties founded in the s in the australian colonies prior to federation
labor tradition ascribes the founding of queensland labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree in barcaldine queensland in
the shearers strike is credited as being one of the factors for the formation of the australian labor party
on september the manifesto of the queensland labour party was read out under the well known tree of knowledge at barcaldine following the great shearers strike
the state library of queensland now holds the manifesto in the historic document was added to unescos memory of the world australian register and in the document was added to unescos memory of the world international register
the balmain new south wales branch of the party claims to be the oldest in australia
however the scone branch has a receipt for membership fees for the labour electoral league dated april
this predates the balmain claim
this can be attested in the centenary of the alp book
labour as a parliamentary party dates from in new south wales and south australia in queensland and later in the other colonies
the first election contested by labour candidates was the new south wales election when labour candidates won of seats
the major parties were the protectionist and free trade parties and labour held the balance of power
it offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions
the united labor party of south australia was founded in and three candidates were that year elected to the south australian legislative council
the first successful south australian house of assembly candidate was john mcpherson at the east adelaide by election
richard hooper however was elected as an independent labor candidate at the wallaroo by election while he was the first labor member of the house of assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ulp
at the south australian elections the ulp was immediately elevated to balance of power status with of lower house seats
the liberal government of charles kingston was formed with the support of the ulp ousting the conservative government of john downer
so successful less than a decade later at the state election thomas price formed the worlds first stable labor government
john verran led labor to form the states first of many majority governments at the state election
in anderson dawson formed a minority labour government in queensland the first in the world which lasted one week while the conservatives regrouped after a split
the colonial labour parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the federation of australia
some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution claiming that the senate as proposed was too powerful similar to the anti reformist colonial upper houses and the british house of lords
they feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces
however the first labour leader and prime minister chris watson was a supporter of federation
historian celia hamilton examining new south wales argues for the central role of irish catholics
before they opposed henry parkes the main liberal leader and of free trade seeing them both as the ideals of protestant englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests
in the strike of the leading catholic sydneys archbishop patrick francis moran was sympathetic toward unions but catholic newspapers were negative
after says hamilton irish catholics were drawn to the labour party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers
in the elections labour gained in the more catholic areas and the representation of catholics increased in labours parliamentary ranks
the federal parliament in was contested by each state labour party
in total they won of the seats in the house of representatives collectively holding the balance of power and the labour members now met as the federal parliamentary labour party on may at parliament house melbourne the meeting place of the first federal parliament
the caucus decided to support the incumbent protectionist party in minority government while the free trade party formed the opposition
it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level
labour under chris watson doubled its vote at the federal election and continued to hold the balance of power
in april however watson and alfred deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the conciliation and arbitration bill to cover state public servants the fallout causing deakin to resign
free trade leader george reid declined to take office which saw watson become the first labour prime minister of australia and the worlds first labour head of government at a national level though his was a minority government that lasted only four months
he was aged only and is still the youngest prime minister in australias history
george reid of the free trade party adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along labour vs
non labour lines prior to the federal election and renamed his free trade party to the anti socialist party
reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti socialist with the protectionist party in the middle
this attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the westminster tradition and regarded a two party system as very much the norm
although watson further strengthened labours position in he stepped down from the leadership the following year to be succeeded by andrew fisher who formed a minority government lasting seven months from late to mid
at the federal election fisher led labor to victory forming australias first elected federal majority government australias first elected senate majority the worlds first labour party majority government at a national level and after the chris watson minority government the worlds second labour party government at a national level
it was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature
the state branches were also successful except in victoria where the strength of deakinite liberalism inhibited the partys growth
the state branches formed their first majority governments in new south wales and south australia in western australia in queensland in and tasmania in
such success eluded equivalent labour parties in other countries for many years
analysis of the early nsw labor caucus reveals a band of unhappy amateurs made up of blue collar workers a squatter a doctor and even a mine owner indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed labor is untrue
in addition many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies in the first grouping of state mps of the were free traders
in the aftermath of world war i and the russian revolution of support for socialism grew in trade union ranks and at the all australian trades union congress a resolution was passed calling for the socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange
the labor party national conference adopted a similarly worded socialist objective which remained official policy for many years
the resolution was immediately qualified however by the blackburn amendment which said that socialisation was desirable only when was necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features
in practice the socialist objective was a dead letter
only once has a federal labor government attempted to nationalise any industry and that was held by the high court to be unconstitutional
the commitment to nationalisation was dropped by gough whitlam and bob hawkes government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and privatisation of state enterprises such as qantas airways and the commonwealth bank
the labor party is commonly described as a social democratic party and its constitution stipulates that it is a democratic socialist party
the party was created by and has always been influenced by the trade unions and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement
thus at the first federal election labors platform called for a white australia policy a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes
labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs conscription and pacifism white australia and multiculturalism nationalisation and privatisation isolationism and internationalism
from to labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the white australia policy which banned all non european migration to australia
this policy was motivated by fears of economic competition from low wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of australians and all major political parties
in practice the labor party opposed all migration on the grounds that immigrants competed with australian workers and drove down wages until after world war ii when the chifley government launched a major immigration program
the partys opposition to non european immigration did not change until after the retirement of arthur calwell as leader in
subsequently labor has become an advocate of multiculturalism
the curtin and chifley governments governed australia through the latter half of the second world war and initial stages of transition to peace
labor leader john curtin became prime minister in october when two independents crossed the floor of parliament
labor led by curtin then led australia through the years of the pacific war
in december curtin announced that australia looks to america free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the united kingdom thus helping to establish the australian american alliance
remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the federal election curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by ben chifley
chifley labor won the federal election and oversaw australias initial transition to a peacetime economy
labor was defeated at the federal election
at the conference of the new south wales labor party in june chifley sought to define the labour movement as follows we have a great objective the light on the hill which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind
would bring something better to the people better standards of living greater happiness to the mass of the people
to a large extent chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions
with an increasingly uncertain economic outlook after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the communist dominated miners federation chifley lost office in to robert menzies liberal national coalition
labor commenced a year period in opposition
the party was primarily led during this time by h
evatt and arthur calwell
various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the alp under gough whitlam resulting in what is now known as the socialist left who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more socially progressive ideals and labor right the now dominant faction that tends to be more economically liberal and focus to a lesser extent on social issues
the whitlam labor government marking a break with labors socialist tradition pursued social democratic policies rather than democratic socialist policies
in contrast to earlier labor leaders whitlam also cut tariffs by percent
whitlam led the federal labor party back to office at the and federal elections and passed a large amount of legislation
the whitlam government lost office following the australian constitutional crisis and dismissal by governor general john kerr after the coalition blocked supply in the senate after a series of political scandals and was defeated at the federal election in the largest landslide of australian federal history
whitlam remains the only prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner
whitlam also lost the federal election and subsequently resigned as leader
bill hayden succeeded whitlam as leader
at the federal election the party achieved a big swing though the unevenness of the swing around the nation prevented an alp victory
in bob hawke became leader of the party after hayden resigned to avoid a leadership spill
bob hawke led labor back to office at the federal election and the party won four consecutive elections under hawke
in december paul keating defeated bob hawke in a leadership spill
the alp then won the federal election
it was in power for five terms over years until severely defeated by john howard at the federal election
this was the longest period the party has ever been in government at the national level
kim beazley led the party to the federal election winning percent of the two party preferred vote but falling short on seats and the alp lost ground at the federal election
after a brief period when simon crean served as alp leader mark latham led labor to the federal election but lost further ground
beazley replaced latham in not long afterwards he in turn was forced out of the leadership by kevin rudd
rudd went on to defeat john howard at the federal election with percent of the two party vote
the rudd government ended prior to the federal election with the overthrow of rudd as leader of the party by deputy leader julia gillard
gillard who was also the first woman to serve as prime minister of australia remained prime minister in a hung parliament following the election
her government lasted until when gillard lost a leadership spill with rudd becoming leader once again
later that year the alp lost the election
after this defeat bill shorten became leader of the party
the party narrowly lost the election yet gained seats
it remained in opposition after the election despite having been ahead in opinion polls for the preceding two years
the party lost in some of the seats which it had won back in
after the defeat shorten resigned from the leadership though he remained in parliament
anthony albanese was elected as leader unopposed and led the party to victory in the election and became the new prime minister
between the federal election and the western australian state election labor was in government nationally and in all eight state and territory legislatures
this was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the act and the nt gained self government
labor narrowly lost government in western australia at the state election and victoria at the state election
these losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in new south wales in queensland in the northern territory in federally in and tasmania in
labor secured a good result in the australian capital territory in and despite losing its majority the party retained government in south australia in
however most of these reversals proved only temporary with labor returning to government in victoria in and in queensland in after spending only one term in opposition in both states
furthermore after winning the fisher by election by nine votes from a percent swing the labor government in south australia went from minority to majority government
labor won landslide victories in the northern territory election the western australian election and the victorian state election
however labor lost the south australian state election after years in government
in labor returned to government after defeating the liberal party in the south australian state election
despite favourable polling the party also did not return to government in the new south wales state election or the federal election
the latter has been considered a historic upset due to labors consistent and significant polling lead the result has been likened to the coalitions loss in the federal election with retrospectively referred to as the unloseable election
anthony albanese later led the party into the australian federal election in which the party once again won a majority government
in labor won the new south wales state election returning to government for the first time since
this victory marked the first time in years that labor were in government in all mainland states
the policy of the australian labor party is contained in its national platform which is approved by delegates to labors national conference held every three years
according to the labor partys website the platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees local branches unions state and territory governments and individual party members
the platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal labor government
the platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future labor government would follow but does not commit the party to specific policies
it maintains that labors traditional values will remain a constant on which all australians can rely
while making it clear that labor is fully committed to a market economy it says that labor believes in a strong role for national government the one institution all australians truly own and control through our right to vote
labor will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands or located only in privileged communities
the benefits must be shared by all australians and all our regions
the platform and labor believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential
for labor government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by ensuring equal opportunity removing unjustifiable discrimination and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth income and status
further sections of the platform stress labors support for equality and human rights labour rights and democracy
in practice the platform provides only general policy guidelines to labors federal state and territory parliamentary leaderships
the policy labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the cabinet or the shadow cabinet in consultation with key interest groups within the party and is contained in the parliamentary leaders policy speech delivered during the election campaign
when labor is in office the policies it implements are determined by the cabinet subject to the platform
generally it is accepted that while the platform binds labor governments how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus
it is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the partys parliamentary leadership as well as the factions
however where there is a direct contradiction with the platform labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy
for example privatisation legislation under the hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform
the australian labor party national executive is the partys chief administrative authority subject only to labors national conference
the executive is responsible for organising the triennial national conference carrying out the decisions of the conference interpreting the national constitution the national platform and decisions of the national conference and directing federal members
the party holds a national conference every three years which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches
the national conference decides the partys platform elects the national executive and appoints office bearers such as the national secretary who also serves as national campaign director during elections
the current national secretary is paul erickson
the most recent national conference was the th conference held in december
the head office of the alp the national secretariat is managed by the national secretary
it plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy
it acts as a permanent secretariat to the national executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party
as the national secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation
the elected members of the labor party in both houses of the national parliament meet as the federal parliamentary labor party also known as the australian labor party caucus
besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics the caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders
until the parliamentary leaders were elected by the caucus from among its members
the leader has historically been a member of the house of representatives
since october a ballot of both the caucus and by the labor partys rank and file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader
when the labor party is in government the party leader is the prime minister and the deputy leader is the deputy prime minister
if a labor prime minister resigns or dies in office the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected
the deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country
members of the ministry are also chosen by caucus though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers
anthony albanese is the leader of the federal labor party serving since may
the deputy leader is richard marles also serving since may
the australian labor party is a federal party consisting of eight branches from each state and territory
while the national executive is responsible for national campaign strategy each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal state and local elections
state and territory branches consist of both individual members and affiliated trade unions who between them decide the partys policies elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office
members join a state branch and pay a membership fee which is graduated according to income
the majority of trade unions in australia are affiliated to the party at a state level
union affiliation is direct and not through the australian council of trade unions
affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership
union affiliation fees make up a large part of the partys income
other sources of funds for the party include political donations and public funding
members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year although there are differences in the rules from state to state
in practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings
many members are only active during election campaigns
the members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences
these conferences decide policy and elect state or territory executives a state or territory president and a state or territory secretary
however act labor directly elects its president
the larger branches also have full time assistant secretaries and organisers
in the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state however under recent national reforms at least of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches
in some states the party also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates
in others it does not preferring to allow its members to run as non endorsed candidates
the process of choosing candidates is called preselection
candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories
in some they are chosen by ballots of all party members in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference in still others by a combination of these two
the country labor party commonly known as country labor was an affiliated organisation of the labor party
although not expressly defined country labor operated mainly within rural new south wales and was mainly seen as an extension of the new south wales branch that operates in rural electorates
country labor was used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas
the country labor party was registered as a separate party in new south wales and was also registered with the australian electoral commission for federal elections
it did not have the same status in other states and consequently that designation could not be used on the ballot paper
the creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the june alp state conference in new south wales
in may following labors success at the benalla by election in victoria kim beazley announced that the alp intended to register a separate country labor party with the aec this occurred in october
the country labor designation was most frequently used in new south wales
according to the alps financial statements for the financial year nsw country labor had around members but almost no assets
it recorded a severe funding shortfall at the new south wales election and had to rely on a million loan from the party proper to remain solvent
it had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources but the nsw electoral commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately
instead the party proper had to loan country labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate
the country labor party was de registered by the new south wales electoral commission in
australian young labor is the youth wing of the australian labor party where all members under age are automatically members
it is the peak youth body within the alp

the current national president is manu risoldi
the australian labor party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party
the national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses
examples of such groups include the labor environment action network rainbow labor labor for choice labor womens network labor for drug law reform labor for refugees labor for housing labor teachers network aboriginal labor network and recently labor enabled the action group for disability advocacy the tasmanian branch of the australian labor party recently gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference
labors constitution has long stated the australian labor party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features in these fields
this socialist objective was introduced in but was later qualified by two further objectives maintenance of and support for a competitive non monopolistic private sector and the right to own private property
labor governments have not attempted the democratic socialisation of any industry since the s when the chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking
the labor party has always had a left wing and a right wing however since it has been organised into formal factions
the two largest factional groupings are the labor left who are supportive of democratic socialist ideals and the labor right who generally support social democratic traditions
the national factional groupings are themselves divided into formal factions primarily state based such as centre unity in new south wales and labor forum in queensland
some trade unions are affiliated with the labor party and are also factionally aligned
important unions supporting the right faction are the australian workers union the shop distributive and allied employees association and the transport workers union of australia
important unions supporting the left include the australian manufacturing workers union united workers union the construction forestry and maritime employees union and the community and public sector union
for the financial year the top ten disclosed donors to the alp were the health services union nsw village roadshow electrical trades union of australia national automotive leasing and salary packaging association westfield corporation randazzo cg developments macquarie telecom woodside energy anz bank and ying zhou all significantly lower than the donations by a chinese donor zi chun wang which at was the largest donation to any political party in the financial year
at least one newspaper report queried the identity of this donor stating news archive searches do not produce results for this name suggesting wang operates under another name
another report mentions that in addition to a hotel and a travel agency the donors listed address at the old communist cadres activity centre in shijiazhuang houses several chinese government entities stating also that another publisher tried many times without success to contact the donor on the phone number listed in the donation return form
the labor party also receives undisclosed funding through several methods such as associated entities
john curtin house industry ir and the happy wanderers club are entities which have been used to funnel donations to the labor party without disclosing the source
a report found that the labor party received from pro gun groups during the periods compared to received by the coalition
the dodo is a fictional character appearing in chapters and of the book alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll
the dodo is a caricature of the author
a popular but unsubstantiated belief is that dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer and thus would accidentally introduce himself as do do dodgson
historically the dodo was a flightless bird that lived on the island of mauritius east of madagascar in the indian ocean
it became extinct in the mid th century during the colonisation of the island by the dutch
in this passage lewis carroll incorporated references to the original boating expedition of july during which alices adventures were first told with alice as herself and the others represented by birds the lory was lorina liddell the eaglet was edith liddell the dodo was dodgson and the duck was rev
robinson duckworth
in order to get dry after a swim the dodo proposes that everyone run a caucus race where the participants run in patterns of any shape starting and leaving off whenever they like so that everyone wins
at the end of the race alice distributes comfits from her pocket to all as prizes
however this leaves no prize for herself
the dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket
as she has only a thimble the dodo requests it from her and then awards it to alice as her prize
the caucus race as depicted by carroll is a satire on the political caucus system mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness
in the disney film the dodo plays a much greater role in the story than in the book
he is merged with the character of pat the gardener which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed pat the dodo but this name is never mentioned in the film
the dodo is also the leader of the caucus race
he has the appearance and personality of a sea captain
the dodo is voiced by bill thompson and animated by milt kahl
dodo is first seen as alice is floating on the sea in a bottle
dodo is seen singing but when alice asks him for help he does not notice her
on shore dodo is seen on a rock organizing a caucus race
this race involves running around until one gets dry but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves
dodo is later summoned by the white rabbit when the rabbit believes a monster actually alice having magically grown to a giant size is inside his home
dodo brings bill the lizard and attempts to get him to go down the chimney
bill refuses at first but dodo is able to convince him otherwise
however the soot causes alice to sneeze sending bill high up into the sky
dodo then decides to burn the house down much to the chagrin of the white rabbit
he begins gathering wood such as the furniture for this purpose
however alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house
the white rabbit soon leaves while dodo asks for matches not realizing that the situation has been resolved
he then asks alice for a match but when she doesnt have any dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire
the dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film conducting another caucus race while alice is being chased by the queen of hearts and her card soldiers
in alices wonderland bakery appears captain dodo being unknown if he is the same character from the film or a descendant as is the case of other characters from wonderland in the series
captain dodo also has a son named jojo
in tim burtons adaptation of alice in wonderland the dodos appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from john tenniels illustration
he bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a navy blue waistcoat and white spats along with glasses and a cane
he is one of alices good willed advisers taking first note of her abilities as the true alice
he is also one of the oldest inhabitants
his name is uilleam and he is portrayed by michael gough
he goes with the white rabbit tweedledum and tweedledee and dormouse to take alice to caterpillar to decide whether alice is the real one
he is later captured by the red queens forces
when alice came to the red queens castle he was seen at the red queens castle yard as a caddy for the queens croquet game
after the red queen orders the release of the jubjub bird to kill all her subjects from rebelling he is then seen briefly running from it when the tweedles went to hide from it and escaped but was snatched by the jubjub and was never seen again throughout the film
his name may be based on a lecture on william the conqueror from chapter three of the original novel
the character is voiced by michael gough in his final feature film role before his death in
gough came out of retirement to appear in the film but the character only speaks three lines so gough managed to record in one day
a lory is a small to medium sized arboreal parrot
albert ii was the margrave of brandenburg kulmbach from to
he was a member of the franconian branch of the house of hohenzollern
because of his bellicose nature albert was given the cognomen bellator during his lifetime
posthumously he became known as alcibiades
albert was born in ansbach and losing his father casimir in he came under the guardianship of his uncle george margrave of brandenburg ansbach a strong adherent of protestantism
in he received bayreuth as his share of the family lands but as the chief town of his principality was kulmbach he is sometimes referred to as the margrave of brandenburg kulmbach
his restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career and having collected a small band of soldiers he assisted emperor charles v in his war with france in
the peace of crpy in september deprived him of this employment but he won a considerable reputation and when charles was preparing to attack the schmalkaldic league he took pains to win alberts assistance
sharing in the attack on the electorate of saxony albert was taken prisoner at rochlitz in march by elector john frederick of saxony but was released as a result of the emperors victory at the battle of mhlberg in the succeeding april
he then followed the fortunes of his friend elector maurice of saxony deserted charles and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the emperor by an alliance with king henry ii of france
he took part in the subsequent campaign but when the peace of passau was signed in august he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in franconia which led to the second margrave war
having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of nuremberg he quarrelled with his supporter the french king and offered his services to the emperor
charles anxious to secure such a famous fighter gladly assented to alberts demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of wrzburg and bamberg and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the emperor on the retreat from the siege of metz in january
when charles left germany a few weeks later albert renewed his depredations in franconia
these soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him and maurice of saxony led an army against his former comrade
the rival forces met at sievershausen on july and after a combat of unusual ferocity albert was put to flight
henry duke of brunswick wolfenbttel then took command of the troops of the league and after albert had been placed under the imperial ban in december he was defeated by duke henry and compelled to flee to france
he there entered the service of henry ii of france and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at pforzheim on january
he is defined by thomas carlyle as a failure of a fritz with features of a frederick the great in him but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors and never came to anything full of fire too much of it wildfire not in the least like an alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent
he had early two children frederick and anna
he was buried at heilsbronn mnster
his hymn was mein got will das gscheh allzeit was translated as the will of god is always best
albert the bear was the first margrave of brandenburg from to his death and was briefly duke of saxony between and
albert was the only son of otto count of ballenstedt and eilika daughter of magnus billung duke of saxony
he inherited his fathers valuable estates in northern saxony in and on his mothers death in succeeded to one half of the lands of the house of billung
albert was a loyal vassal of his relation lothar i duke of saxony from whom about he received the margraviate of lusatia to the east after lothar became king of the germans he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to bohemia against the upstart sobslav i duke of bohemia in at the battle of kulm where he suffered a short imprisonment
alberts entanglements in saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there
after the death of his brother in law henry ii margrave of the nordmark who controlled a small area on the elbe called the saxon northern march in albert disappointed at not receiving this fief himself attacked udo v count of stade the heir and was consequently deprived of lusatia by lothar
udo however was said to have been assassinated by servants of albert on march near aschersleben
in spite of this albert went to italy in in the train of the king and his services there were rewarded in by the investiture of the northern march which was again without a ruler
in conrad iii the hohenstaufen king of the germans deprived alberts cousin and nemesis henry the proud of his saxon duchy which was awarded to albert if he could take it
after some initial success in his efforts to take possession albert was driven from saxony and also from his northern march by a combined force of henry and jaxa of kpenick and compelled to take refuge in south germany
henry died in and an arrangement was found
henrys son henry the lion received the duchy of saxony in
in the same year albert renounced the saxon duchy and received the counties of weimar and orlamnde
once he was firmly established in the northern march alberts covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east
for three years he was occupied in campaigns against the slavic wends who as pagans were considered fair game and whose subjugation to christianity was the aim of the wendish crusade of in which albert took part
albert was a part of the army that besieged demmin and at the end of the war recovered havelberg which had been lost since
diplomatic measures were more successful and by an arrangement made with the last of the wendish princes of brandenburg pribislav henry of the hevelli albert secured this district when the prince died in
taking the title margrave in brandenburg he pressed the crusade against the wends extended the area of his mark encouraged dutch and german settlement in the elbe havel region established bishoprics under his protection and so became the founder of the margraviate of brandenburg in which his heirs the house of ascania held until the line died out in
in a feud with henry the lion duke of saxony was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the holy land
on his return in he with the consent of his sons siegfried not being mentioned donated land to the knights of saint john in memory of his wife sofia at werben on the elbe
around this same time he minted a pfennig in memory of his deceased wife
in albert accompanied emperor frederick barbarossa to italy where he distinguished himself at the storming of milan
in albert joined a league of princes formed against henry the lion and peace being made in albert divided his territories among his six sons
he died on november and was buried at ballenstedt
alberts personal qualities won for him the cognomen of the bear not from his looks or qualities for he was a tall handsome man but from the cognisance on his shield an able man had a quick eye as well as a strong hand and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things was the shining figure and the great man of the north in his day got much in the north and kept it got brandenburg for one there a conspicuous country ever since says thomas carlyle who called albert a restless much managing wide warring man
he was also called the handsome
albert of brandenburg was a german cardinal elector archbishop of mainz from to and archbishop of magdeburg from to
through his notorious sale of indulgences he became the catalyst for martin luthers reformation and its staunch opponent
born in clln on the spree now a central part of berlin into the ruling house of hohenzollern albert was the younger son of john cicero elector of brandenburg and margaret of thuringia
after their fathers death in alberts older brother joachim i nestor became elector of brandenburg while albert held only the title of a margrave of brandenburg
albert studied at the university of frankfurt and in became archbishop of magdeburg at the age of and administrator of the diocese of halberstadt
in he was also elected archbishop of mainz and thus sovereign of the electorate of mainz and archchancellor of the holy roman empire
by electing him the mainz cathedral chapter hoped for the support of the elector of brandenburg in defending the city of erfurt which belonged to the archbishopric of mainz against the expansionist efforts of the neighboring saxon dukes
however this choice violated the canonical prohibition to hold more than one bishopric
albert also did not meet the requirements for taking over any diocese since he had not yet reached the age and he didnt have a college degree therefore he received a study dispensation in
albert borrowed guilders from jacob fugger to pay the confirmation fee to the roman curia
in albert suggested to pope leo x that a special indulgence be announced in his three dioceses as well as in his native diocese of brandenburg and that half of the income should be used for the construction of the new st
peters basilica and half for alberts own cash register
the papal bull was issued on march
the indulgence was entrusted to albert in for publication in saxony and brandenburg
it cost him the considerable sum of ten thousand ducats and albert employed johann tetzel for the actual preaching of the indulgence
later martin luther addressed a letter of protest to albert concerning the conduct of tetzel
largely in reaction to tetzels actions luther wrote his famous ninety five theses which led to the reformation
luther sent these to albert on october and according to a disputable tradition nailed a copy to the door of castle church in wittenberg
albert forwarded the theses to rome suspecting luther of heresy
as archbishop of mainz he tried unsuccessfully in and to expel the jews living in mainz
in at the age of he was made a cardinal
when the imperial election of drew near partisans of the two leading candidates eagerly solicited the vote of the prince archbishop of mainz and albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote
the electors eventually chose charles who became the emperor charles v
like other high ranking clergymen of his time archbishop albert lived in concubinage gave his lovers gifts and favored his children as far as possible without causing much offense
recent research assumes that he lived in a marriage like relationship at first with elisabeth leys schtz from mainz and then with the frankfurt widow agnes pless ne strauss
with leys schtz he had a daughter named anna whom he married to his secretary joachim kirchner
alberts large and liberal ideas his correspondence with leading humanists his friendship with ulrich von hutten whom he drew to his court and his political ambitions appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to protestantism but after the german peasants war of he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of catholicism and was among the princes who joined the league of dessau in july
from until his flight on february albert ruled mostly from his residence moritzburg in halle
in he had a spacious new residential palace built there
albert also needed a prestigious church that met his expectations at a central location in his residenz town
he feared for his peace of mind in heaven and collected more than relics and holy skeletons which needed to be stored
from he had two parish churches standing next to each other demolished and only their four towers from with pointed helmets stood
between these towers he had a large new nave built which was named market church of our lady since she received a marian patronage
however these precious treasures known as hallesches heilthum indirectly related to the sale of indulgences which had triggered the reformation a few years before because it should attract pilgrims willing to pay
then the cardinal and the catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of the reformation by holding far grander masses and services in a new church dedicated solely to the blessed virgin mary whose excessive worship luther disliked
alberts hostility towards the reformers however was not so extreme as that of his brother joachim i and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace although he was a member of the league of nuremberg formed in as a counterpoise to the league of schmalkalden
new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of magdeburg in return for florins
in his later years he showed more intolerance towards the protestants and favoured the teaching of the jesuits in his dominions
the market church of our lady in halle which had been built to defend against the spread of reformation sympathies was the spot where justus jonas officially introduced the reformation into halle with his good friday sermon in
the service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave
jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed
albert left the town permanently after the estates in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of jakob fugger
halle became protestant and in jonas was appointed as priest to st
marys and in bishop over the city
he became a friend of science and a patron of the arts
as a patron of learning he counted erasmus among his friends
however alberts ideas about founding a catholic university in halle were not implemented
nonetheless he adorned halle cathedral and mainz cathedral in sumptuous fashion and took as his motto the words
matthias grnewald and lucas cranach the elder created magnificent paintings for the halle cathedral which was decorated from to with passion altars with pictures by cranach and his workshop the largest single commission in german art history
grnewald contributed the famous wood painting saint erasmus and saint maurice
albert also ordered paintings from hans baldung grien and a cycle of life size statues of saints from peter schro in mainz which can still be admired in halle cathedral today
in he donated the market fountain in mainz
in martin luther referred to the ever growing collection of relics as the idol of halle
when albert left halle for good in and moved to his residence in aschaffenburg in the electoral state of mainz he took with him the collection of relics his private art collection and a large part of the works of art he had donated to the cathedral and other catholic churches that now became protestant
he sold parts of the treasure of relics in order to be able to settle claims of the cathedral chapters of magdeburg and halberstadt the sanctuaries are scattered today
he took his private paintings with him to his residence in johannisburg castle where a large part was plundered and destroyed in during the second margrave war
he had the works of art brought from halle cathedral hung in the st
peter und alexanders church where they survived all wars until the elector archbishop carl theodor von dalberg had them brought to johannisburg castle in
there they were evacuated in good time before the damaging fire caused by bombing in
today they can be seen in the reconstructed castle in the staatsgalerie aschaffenburg which was reopened in after several years of renovation
despite the losses caused by wars looting and sales the aschaffenburg collection is considered the largest cranach collection in europe
in addition to altar wings some of which consist of several panels and individual paintings from the cranach workshop autographed works by the older and by the younger cranach are on display
in addition a crucifixion group by hans baldung grien and a large number of paintings by cranachs students
some other altars and paintings from the school are also preserved in the st
peter und alexanders church and its museum
other paintings are in the alte pinakothek in munich
albert died at the martinsburg mainz in
his tomb is in mainz cathedral
albert of prussia was a german prince who was the th grand master of the teutonic knights and after converting to lutheranism became the first ruler of the duchy of prussia the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights
albert was the first european ruler to establish lutheranism and thus protestantism as the official state religion of his lands
he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades
albert was great grandson of the converted pagan ruler jogaila of poland and lithuania vanquisher of the teutonic knights at the battle of grunwald
he was also a member of the brandenburg ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern
he became grand master of the teutonic knights in their attempt to diplomatically win over the polish lithuanian union
his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the teutonic order
but albert was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther whose teachings had become popular in his lands
so he rebelled against the roman catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm the duchy of prussia for which he paid homage to his uncle sigismund i king of poland
that arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krakw in
albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs
alberts rule in prussia was fairly prosperous
although he had some trouble with the peasantry the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court
he was active in imperial politics joining the league of torgau in and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may
albert established schools in every town and founded the university of knigsberg in
he promoted culture and arts patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger
during the final years of his rule albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now depleted church lands causing peasant rebellion
the intrigues of the court favourites johann funck and paul skali also led to various religious and political disputes
albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at tapiau on march
his son albert frederick succeeded him as duke of prussia
albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i margrave of brandenburg ansbach
his mother was sophia daughter of casimir iv jagiellon grand duke of lithuania and king of poland and his wife elisabeth of austria
his great grandfather was wadysaw ii jagieo the last pagan ruler in europe who defeated the teutonic knights at the battle of grunwald in
he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse elector of cologne who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral
not only was he quite religious he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories
his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advancement
turning to a more active life albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary
duke frederick of saxony grand master of the teutonic order died in december
albert was chosen as his successor early in in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle sigismund i the old grand duke of lithuania and king of poland would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn
the new grand master aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy refused to submit to the crown of poland
as war over the orders existence appeared inevitable albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with emperor maximilian i
the ill feeling influenced by the ravages of members of the order in poland culminated in a war which began in december and devastated prussia
albert was granted a four year truce early in
the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war
for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism
the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself
this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines
luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while alberts brother margrave george of brandenburg ansbach laid the scheme before their uncle sigismund i the old of poland
after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krakw albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on february
the estates of the land then met at knigsberg and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther
this transition did not however take place without protest
summoned before the imperial court of justice albert refused to appear and was proscribed while the order elected a new grand master walter von cronberg who received prussia as a fief at the imperial diet of augsburg
as the german princes were experiencing the tumult of the reformation the german peasants war and the wars against the ottoman turks they did not enforce the ban on the duke and agitation against him soon died away
in imperial politics albert was fairly active
joining the league of torgau in he acted in unison with the protestants and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may
for various reasons however poverty and personal inclination among others he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period
the early years of alberts rule in prussia were fairly prosperous
although he had some trouble with the peasantry the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court
he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life
in in spite of some opposition he founded knigsberg university where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in
albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical prutenic tables compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger
osianders appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of alberts reign
osianders divergence from luthers doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon who had adherents in knigsberg and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town
the duke strenuously supported osiander and the area of the quarrel soon broadened
there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles the burden of taxation was heavy and alberts rule became unpopular
after osianders death in albert favoured a preacher named johann funck who with an adventurer named paul skali exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense
the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of alberts early death and the need should that happen to appoint a regent as his only son albert frederick was still a mere youth
the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander and the climax came in when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland alberts cousin who sent a commission to knigsberg
skali saved his life by flight but funck was executed
the question of the regency was settled and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers
virtually deprived of power the duke lived for two more years and died at tapiau on march of the plague along with his wife
cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within knigsberg cathedral
albert was a voluminous letter writer and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time
albert was the first german noble to support luthers ideas and in founded the university of knigsberg the albertina as a rival to the roman catholic krakow academy
it was the second lutheran university in the german states after the university of marburg
a relief of albert over the renaissance era portal of knigsberg castles southern wing was created by andreas hess in according to plans by christoph rmer
another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertinas original campus
this depiction which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder was the popular albertus the symbol of the university
the original was moved to knigsberg public library to protect it from the elements while the sculptor paul kimritz created a duplicate for the wall
another version of the albertus by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the knigsberg state and royal library
in friedrich reusch created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgebude the administrative building for regierungsbezirk knigsberg
on may reusch premiered a famous statue of albert at knigsberg castle with the inscription albert of brandenburg last grand master first duke in prussia
albert wolff also designed an equestrian statue of albert located at the new campus of the albertina
kings gate contains a statue of albert
albert was oft honored in the quarter maraunenhof in northern knigsberg
its main street was named herzog albrecht allee in
its town square knig ottokar platz was renamed herzog albrecht platz in to match its church the herzog albrecht gedchtniskirche

later the hectare roman spa resort town of aquae granni was according to legend founded by grenus under hadrian around ad

the geology of aachen is very structurally heterogeneous
the oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the devonian period and include carboniferous sandstone greywacke claystone and limestone
these formations are part of the rhenish massif north of the high fens
in the pennsylvanian subperiod of the carboniferous geological period these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the variscan orogeny
after this event and over the course of the following million years this area has been continuously flattened
during the cretaceous period the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the north sea up to the mountainous area near aachen bringing with it clay sand and chalk deposits
while the clay is mostly found in the lower areas of aachen the hills of the aachen forest and the lousberg were formed from upper cretaceous sand and chalk deposits
more recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of aachen and was formed through tertiary and quaternary river and wind activities
along the major thrust fault of the variscan orogeny there are over thermal springs in aachen and burtscheid

agate is the banded variety of chalcedony which comes in a wide variety of colors
agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks
the ornamental use of agate was common in ancient greece in assorted jewelry and in the seal stones of greek warriors while bead necklaces with pierced and polished agate date back to the rd millennium bce in the indus valley civilisation
the stone was given its name by theophrastus a greek philosopher and naturalist who discovered the stone along the shore line of the dirillo river or achates in sicily sometime between the th and rd centuries bce
agate minerals have the tendency to form on or within pre existing rocks creating difficulties in accurately determining their time of formation
their host rocks have been dated to have formed as early as the archean eon
agates are most commonly found as nodules within the cavities of volcanic rocks
these cavities are formed from the gases trapped within the liquid volcanic material forming vesicles
cavities are then filled in with silica rich fluids from the volcanic material layers are deposited on the walls of the cavity slowly working their way inwards
the first layer deposited on the cavity walls is commonly known as the priming layer
variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers
these variations in layers result in bands of chalcedony often alternating with layers of crystalline quartz forming banded agate
hollow agates can also form due to the deposition of liquid rich silica not penetrating deep enough to fill the cavity completely
agate will form crystals within the reduced cavity and the apex of each crystal may point towards the center of the cavity
the priming layer is often dark green but can be modified by iron oxide resulting in a rust like appearance
agate is very durable and is often found detached from its host matrix which has eroded away
once removed the outer surface is usually pitted and rough from filling the cavity of its former matrix
agates have also been found in sedimentary rocks normally in limestone or dolomite these sedimentary rocks acquire cavities often from decomposed branches or other buried organic material
if silica rich fluids are able to penetrate into these cavities agates can be formed
lace agate is a variety that exhibits a lace like pattern with forms such as eyes swirls bands or zigzags
blue lace agate is found in africa and is especially hard
crazy lace agate typically found in mexico is often brightly colored with a complex pattern demonstrating randomized distribution of contour lines and circular droplets scattered throughout the rock
the stone is typically coloured red and white but is also seen to exhibit yellow and grey combinations as well
moss agate as the name suggests exhibits a moss like pattern and is of a greenish colour
the coloration is not created by any vegetative growth but rather through the mixture of chalcedony and oxidized iron hornblende
dendritic agate also displays vegetative features including fern like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides
turritella agate is formed from the shells of fossilized freshwater turritella gastropods with elongated spiral shells
similarly coral petrified wood porous rocks and other organic remains can also form agate
coldwater agates such as the lake michigan cloud agate did not form under volcanic processes but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin
like volcanic origin agates coldwater agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock
these agates are typically less colorful with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony
greek agate is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in the former greek colony of sicily as early as bce
the greeks used it for making jewelry and beads
brazilian agate is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules
these occur in brownish tones inter layered with white and gray
it is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes
polyhedroid agate forms in a flat sided shape similar to a polyhedron
when sliced it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric polygons
it has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling in of spaces between pre existing crystals which have since dissolved
iris agate is a finely banded and usually colorless agate that when thinly sliced exhibits spectral decomposition of white light into its constituent colors requiring to up to bands per inch
other forms of agate include holley blue agate a rare dark blue ribbon agate found only near holley oregon lake superior agate carnelian agate botswana agate plume agate condor agate tube agate containing visible flow channels or pinhole sized tubes fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts binghamite a variety found only on the cuyuna iron range in crow wing county minnesota fire agate showing an iridescent internal flash or fire the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite patuxent river stone a red and yellow form of agate only found in maryland and enhydro agate which contains tiny inclusions of water sometimes with air bubbles
agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of hardstone carving and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites indicating its widespread use in the ancient world for example archaeological recovery at the knossos site on crete illustrates its role in bronze age minoan culture
it has also been used for centuries for leather burnishing tools
the decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as pins brooches or other types of jewellery paper knives inkstands marbles and seals
agate is also still used today for decorative displays cabochons beads carvings and intarsia art as well as face polished and tumble polished specimens of varying size and origin
idar oberstein was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale
where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the european market this became a globalized business around the turn of the th century idar oberstein imported large quantities of agate from brazil as ships ballast
making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe
agates have long been used in arts and crafts
the sanctuary of a presbyterian church in yachats oregon has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches
industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack
it has traditionally been used to make knife edge bearings for laboratory balances and precision pendulums and sometimes to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals
respiratory diseases such as silicosis and a higher incidence of tuberculosis among workers involved in the agate industry have been studied in india and china
aspirin also known as acetylsalicylic acid is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug used to reduce pain fever and or inflammation and as an antithrombotic
specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include kawasaki disease pericarditis and rheumatic fever
aspirin is also used long term to help prevent further heart attacks ischaemic strokes and blood clots in people at high risk
for pain or fever effects typically begin within minutes
aspirin works similarly to other nsaids but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets
one common adverse effect is an upset stomach
more significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma
bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other nsaids or are on other blood thinners
aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy
it is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of reye syndrome
high doses may result in ringing in the ears
a precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least years
in chemist charles frdric gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time
over the next years other chemists mostly of the german company bayer established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods
aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions
it is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated consumed each year and is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines
in it was the th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states with more than million prescriptions
in scientists at the bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines
by bayer had named it aspirin and was selling it around the world
aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to competition between many brands and formulations
the word aspirin was bayers brand name however their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries
the name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a spir spiraea the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at bayer in the common chemical suffix
aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates carbonates citrates or hydroxides of the alkali metals
it is stable in dry air but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids
in solution with alkalis the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate
like flour mills factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building because the powder air mixture can be explosive
the national institute for occupational safety and health has set a recommended exposure limit in the united states of mg m
in the occupational safety and health administration set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of mg m but this was vacated by the afl cio v
osha decision in
the synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction
salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride an acid derivative causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acids hydroxyl group into an ester group
this process yields aspirin and acetic acid which is considered a byproduct of this reaction
small amounts of sulfuric acid are almost always used as a catalyst
this method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs
formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids
aspirin an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid is a white crystalline weakly acidic substance which melts at and decomposes around
its acid dissociation constant is at
polymorphism or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients
many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph
there was only one proven polymorph form i of aspirin though the existence of another polymorph was debated since the s and one report from reported that when crystallized in the presence of aspirin anhydride the diffractogram of aspirin has weak additional peaks
though at the time it was dismissed as mere impurity it was in retrospect form ii aspirin
form ii was reported in found after attempted co crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile
in form i pairs of aspirin molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds
in form ii each aspirin molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds but with two neighbouring molecules instead of one
with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures
the aspirin polymorphs contain identical dimensional sections and are therefore more precisely described as polytypes
pure form ii aspirin could be prepared by seeding the batch with aspirin anhydrate in weight
in british pharmacologist john robert vane then employed by the royal college of surgeons in london showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
for this discovery he was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine jointly with sune bergstrm and bengt ingemar samuelsson
aspirins ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis
aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the cox enzyme
this makes aspirin different from other nsaids which are reversible inhibitors
low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet
this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack unstable angina ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin i synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition
prostaglandins local hormones produced in the body have diverse effects including the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat and inflammation
thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots
heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction
at least two different types of cyclooxygenases cox and cox are acted on by aspirin
aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox
cox normally produces prostanoids most of which are proinflammatory
aspirin modified cox produces lipoxins most of which are anti inflammatory
newer nsaid drugs cox inhibitors have been developed to inhibit only cox with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects
several cox inhibitors such as rofecoxib have been withdrawn from the market after evidence emerged that cox inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express cox and by selectively inhibiting cox prostaglandin production is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels as cox in platelets is unaffected
thus the protective anticoagulative effect of pgi is removed increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems
since platelets have no dna they are unable to synthesize new cox once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors
furthermore aspirin while inhibiting the ability of cox to form pro inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins converts this enzymes activity from a prostaglandin forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase like enzyme aspirin treated cox metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin triggered lipoxins aspirin triggered resolvins and aspirin triggered maresins
these mediators possess potent anti inflammatory activity
it is proposed that this aspirin triggered transition of cox from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin
aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action
it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous mitochondria by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons
aspirin buffers and transports the protons
when high doses are given it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses
in addition aspirin induces the formation of no radicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation
this reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection however evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection
more recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through nf b
nf b a transcription factor complex plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation
aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid which itself has anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic effects
in salicylic acid was found to activate amp activated protein kinase which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin
the acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets
acetylation of cellular proteins is a well established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post translational level
aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to cox isoenzymes
these acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin
aspirin is produced in many formulations with some differences in effect
in particular aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding
formulations may be combined
acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration
acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach
the increased ph and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there as more of it is ionized
owing to the formation of concretions aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to hours after ingestion
about of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin while the rest remains in the active ionized state protein binding is concentration dependent
saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity
the volume of distribution is l kg
acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates
as much as of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver
conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters
the conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide
these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity
small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid
with large salicylate doses the kinetics switch from first order to zero order as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important
salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid free salicylic acid salicylic phenol and acyl glucuronides gentisic acid and dihydroxybenzoic acid
when small doses are ingested all pathways proceed by first order kinetics with an elimination half life of about h to h
when higher doses of salicylate are ingested the half life becomes much longer because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated
renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary ph
a to fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine ph is increased from to
the use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination
it was found that short term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis
aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated
medicines made from willow and other salicylate rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient sumer as well as the ebers papyrus from ancient egypt
hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around bc and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of western medicine in classical antiquity and the middle ages
willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever pain and inflammation in the mid eighteenth century
by the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid the active component of willow extract
in chemist charles frdric gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time in the second half of the th century other academic chemists established the compounds chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis
in scientists at the drug and dye firm bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines and identified a new way to synthesize it
by bayer had dubbed this drug aspirin and was selling it globally
the word aspirin was bayers brand name rather than the generic name of the drug however bayers rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries
aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products
aspirins popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen paracetamol in and ibuprofen in
in the s and s john vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirins effects while clinical trials and other studies from the s to the s established aspirins efficacy as an anti clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases
the initial large studies on the use of low dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the s and s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and us federal law and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women
aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the th century and remain strong in the st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes
bayer lost its trademark for aspirin in the united states and some other countries in actions taken between and because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of aspirin by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights
today aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries
aspirin with a capital a remains a registered trademark of bayer in germany canada mexico and in over other countries for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets but using different packaging and physical aspects for each
aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions including fever pain rheumatic fever and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis pericarditis and kawasaki disease
lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy
there is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear
in the united states the selective initiation of low dose aspirin based on an individualised assessment has been deemed reasonable for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people aged between and who have a or greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next years and are not at an increased risk of bleeding
aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding
aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps bloating gastric distension or acute skin irritation
as with other nsaids combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone
effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines
topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain
aspirin either by itself or in a combined formulation effectively treats certain types of a headache but its efficacy may be questionable for others
secondary headaches meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma should be promptly treated by a medical provider
among primary headaches the international classification of headache disorders distinguishes between tension headache migraine and cluster headache
aspirin or other over the counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches
aspirin especially as a component of an aspirin paracetamol caffeine combination is considered a first line therapy in the treatment of migraine and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan
it is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning
like its ability to control pain aspirins ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of cox
although aspirins use as an antipyretic in adults is well established many medical societies and regulatory agencies including the american academy of family physicians the american academy of pediatrics and the food and drug administration strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of reyes syndrome a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection
because of the risk of reyes syndrome in children in the us food and drug administration required labeling on all aspirin containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers
aspirin is used as an anti inflammatory agent for both acute and long term inflammation as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack
it is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems including those over the age of
the antithrombotic trialists collaboration published in lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention
in those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction daily low dose aspirin was associated with a relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events
this did come at the expense of a absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding however the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case
data from previous trials have suggested that weight based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes
however more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight in specific subset of population studied ie elderly and diabetic population and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight
after percutaneous coronary interventions such as the placement of a coronary artery stent a us agency for healthcare research and quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely
frequently aspirin is combined with an adp receptor inhibitor such as clopidogrel prasugrel or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots
this is called dual antiplatelet therapy
duration of dapt was advised in the united states and european union guidelines after the cure and prodigy studies
in the systematic review and network meta analysis from khan et al
showed promising benefits of short term dapt followed by py inhibitors in selected patients as well as the benefits of extended term dapt in high risk patients
in conclusion the optimal duration of dapt after pcis should be personalized after outweighing each patients risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient related and procedure related factors
moreover aspirin should be continued indefinitely after dapt is complete
the status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies
the ascend study demonstrated that in high bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease there is no overall clinical benefit of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of years
similarly the results of the arrive study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years
aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease
complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance
for people who are resistant aspirins efficacy is reduced
some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin
as of the united states preventive services task force determined that there was a small net benefit for patients aged with a or greater year cardiovascular disease risk and no net benefit for patients aged over
determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes
their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age while the risk of bleeding while small increases with age particular for adults over and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding
as a result the uspstf suggests that people ages to who are at higher risk for cvd should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin people or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke
primary prevention guidelines from made by the american college of cardiology and the american heart association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged with a higher risk of atherosclerotic cvd without an increased bleeding risk while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk
they state a cvd risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin while stating aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of because of lack of net benefit
as of the european society of cardiology made similar recommendations considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than at high or very high cvd risk without any clear contraindications on a case by case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk
aspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer
there is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer but aspirin must be taken for at least years to see this benefit
it may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer
some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk
others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk
given this uncertainty the united states preventive services task force guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of crc in people with average risk
nine years later however the uspstf issued a grade b recommendation for the use of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cvd disease and crc in adults to years of age who have a or greater year cvd risk are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least years and are willing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least years
a meta analysis through said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum esophagus and stomach
in the us preventive services task force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention
it notes the results of the aspree trial in which the risk of cancer related death was higher in the aspirin treated group than in the placebo group
aspirin along with several other agents with anti inflammatory properties has been repurposed as an add on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders
a systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies
however further high quality longer duration double blind randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add on treatment for bipolar depression
thus notwithstanding the biological rationale the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain
although cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this
some researchers have speculated the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia
small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking
aspirin is a first line treatment for the fever and joint pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever
the therapy often lasts for one to two weeks and is rarely indicated for longer periods
after fever and pain have subsided the aspirin is no longer necessary since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease
naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic but due to the limited clinical experience naproxen is recommended only as a second line treatment
along with rheumatic fever kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness
low dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre eclampsia
this benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy
aspirin has also demonstrated anti tumoral effects via inhibition of the pttg gene which is often overexpressed in tumors
for some people aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity
one study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men and a different aggregate study of people found were resistant
a study in italian people found of the apparent aspirin resistant subjects only were truly resistant and the others were noncompliant
another study of healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant but some had pseudoresistance reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption
meta analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases
although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis the sequelae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty
some of these risk factors include obesity advancing age diabetes mellitus dyslipidemia and inflammatory diseases
adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes which vary slightly from country to country for example mg in britain and mg in the united states
smaller doses are based on these standards eg mg and mg tablets
the mg tablets are commonly called baby aspirin or baby strength because they were originallybut no longerintended to be administered to infants and children
no medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the mg and the mg tablets
the dose required for benefit appears to depend on a persons weight
for those weighing less than low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease for patients above this weight higher doses are required
in general for adults doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever
for the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease much lower doses are taken once daily
march recommendations from the uspstf on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged and women aged to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in mi for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage
the whi study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death from any cause though there was no significant difference between mg and mg aspirin doses
the adaptable study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between mg and mg doses of aspirin in patients with established cardiovascular disease
low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events and lower aspirin doses may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long term prevention
in children with kawasaki disease aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks
in october the us food and drug administration required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid
they recommend avoiding nsaids in pregnant women at weeks or later in pregnancy
one exception to the recommendation is the use of low dose mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional
aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to nsaids and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or nsaid precipitated bronchospasm
owing to its effect on the stomach lining manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers mild diabetes or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin
even if none of these conditions is present the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin
people with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates
aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease
use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency
aspirin taken at doses of mg and mg per day for days can increase the odds of suffering a gout attack by and respectively
this effect may potentially be worsened by high purine diets diuretics and kidney disease but is eliminated by the urate lowering drug allopurinol
daily low dose aspirin does not appear to worsen kidney function
aspirin may reduce cardiovascular risk in those without established cardiovascular disease in people with moderate ckd without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding
aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under the age of to control cold or influenza symptoms as this has been linked with reyes syndrome
aspirin increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
enteric coating on aspirin may be used in manufacturing to prevent release of aspirin into the stomach to reduce gastric harm but enteric coating does not reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk
enteric coated aspirin may not be as effective at reducing blood clot risk
combining aspirin with other nsaids has been shown to further increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding
using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding
blockade of cox by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of cox as part of a gastric defense
there is no clear evidence that simultaneous use of a cox inhibitor with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury
buffering is an additional method used with the intent to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding such as by preventing aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed
almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used bufferin for example uses magnesium oxide
other preparations use calcium carbonate
gas forming agents in effervescent tablet and powder formulations can also double as a buffering agent one example being sodium bicarbonate used in alka seltzer
taking vitamin c with aspirin has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining
in trials vitamin c releasing aspirin or a buffered aspirin formulation containing vitamin c was found to cause less stomach damage than aspirin alone
it is a widespread habit among eye specialists to prescribe aspirin as an add on medication for patients with retinal vein occlusion such as central retinal vein occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion
the reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion
however a large scale investigation based on data of nearly patients showed that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with crvo and hemi crvo without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect
several expert groups including the royal college of ophthalmologists recommended against the use of antithrombotic drugs for patients with rvo
large doses of salicylate a metabolite of aspirin cause temporary tinnitus based on experiments in rats via the action on arachidonic acid and nmda receptors cascade
reyes syndrome a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection
from to cases of reyes syndrome in people younger than were reported to the us centers for disease control and prevention
of these reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of reyes syndrome most commonly with a respiratory infection chickenpox or diarrhea
salicylates were detectable in of children for whom test results were reported
after the association between reyes syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it were implemented aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the united states as did the number of reported cases of reyes syndrome a similar decline was found in the united kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued
the us food and drug administration recommends aspirin should not be given to anyone under the age of who has a fever and the uk national health service recommends children who are under years of age should not take aspirin unless it is on the advice of a doctor
for a small number of people taking aspirin can result in symptoms including hives swelling and headache
aspirin can exacerbate symptoms among those with chronic hives or create acute symptoms of hives
these responses can be due to allergic reactions to aspirin or more often due to its effect of inhibiting the cox enzyme
skin reactions may also tie to systemic contraindications seen with nsaid precipitated bronchospasm or those with atopy
aspirin and other nsaids such as ibuprofen may delay the healing of skin wounds
earlier findings from two small low quality trials suggested a benefit with aspirin on venous leg ulcer healing time and leg ulcer size however larger more recent studies of higher quality have been unable to corroborate these outcomes
as such further research is required to clarify the role of aspirin in this context
aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people
in one study angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people
however when the aspirin was taken alone it did not cause angioedema in these people the aspirin had been taken in combination with another nsaid induced drug when angioedema appeared
aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on mri scans of to mm or smaller hypointense patches
a study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage of events per persons
in comparison the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was events per persons and a reduction of events per persons in ischemic stroke
in cases where ich already has occurred aspirin use results in higher mortality with a dose of about mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich around
aspirin and other nsaids can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis however these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state
use of low dose aspirin before a surgical procedure has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events in some patients however ceasing aspirin prior to surgery has also been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events
an analysis of multiple studies found a three fold increase in adverse events such as myocardial infarction in patients who ceased aspirin prior to surgery
the analysis found that the risk is dependent on the type of surgery being performed and the patient indication for aspirin use
on july the us food and drug administration toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs
aspirin is an nsaid but is not affected by the new warnings
aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic
in acute poisoning a single large dose is taken in chronic poisoning higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time
acute overdose has a mortality rate of
chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of chronic overdose may be especially severe in children
toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments including activated charcoal intravenous dextrose and normal saline sodium bicarbonate and dialysis
the diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate the active metabolite of aspirin by automated spectrophotometric methods
plasma salicylate levels in general range from to mg l after usual therapeutic doses mg l in people taking high doses and mg l following acute overdose
salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate methyl salicylate and sodium salicylate
aspirin is known to interact with other drugs
for example acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs
aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide warfarin methotrexate phenytoin probenecid valproic acid and other nsaids
corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin
other nsaids such as ibuprofen and naproxen may reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin
although limited evidence suggests this may not result in a reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin
analgesic doses of aspirin decrease sodium loss induced by spironolactone in the urine however this does not reduce the antihypertensive effects of spironolactone
furthermore antiplatelet doses of aspirin are deemed too small to produce an interaction with spironolactone
aspirin is known to compete with penicillin g for renal tubular secretion
aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin c
the isis trial demonstrated that aspirin at doses of mg daily for one month decreased the mortality by of participants with a suspected myocardial infarction in the first five weeks
a single daily dose of mg of aspirin for weeks has a highly protective effect against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina
aspirin has been repurposed as an add on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder
however meta analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of bipolar depression
thus notwithstanding the biological rationale the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain
several studies investigated the anti infective properties of aspirin for bacterial viral and parasitic infections
aspirin was demonstrated to limit platelet activation induced by staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis and to reduce streptococcal adhesion to heart valves
in patients with tuberculous meningitis the addition of aspirin reduced the risk of new cerebral infarction
a role of aspirin on bacterial and fungal biofilm is also being supported by growing evidence
evidence from observational studies were conflicting on the effect of aspirin in breast cancer prevention a randomized controlled trial showed that aspirin had no significant effect in reducing breast cancer thus further studies are needed to clarify aspirin effect in cancer prevention
there are many anecdotal reportings that aspirin can improve plants growth and resistance though most research involved salicylic acid instead of aspirin
aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis
aspirin should only be given to animals under the direct supervision of a veterinarian as adverse effects including gastrointestinal issues are common
an aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning characterized by hemorrhaging seizures coma and even death
dogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are
cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly
no clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given mg kg of aspirin every hours for weeks but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is mg kg every hours to allow for metabolization
in the hebrew bible abner was the cousin of king saul and the commander in chief of his army
his name also appears as abiner son of ner where the longer form abiner means my father is ner
abner is initially mentioned incidentally in sauls history first appearing as the son of ner sauls uncle and the commander of sauls army
he then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced david to saul following davids killing of goliath
he is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous battle of gilboa when sauls power was crushed
seizing the youngest but only surviving of sauls sons ish bosheth also called eshbaal abner set him up as king over israel at mahanaim east of the jordan
david who was accepted as king by judah alone was meanwhile reigning at hebron and for some time war was carried on between the two parties
the only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at gibeon between chosen men from each side in which all seem to have perished
in the general engagement which followed abner was defeated and put to flight
he was closely pursued by asahel brother of joab who is said to have been light of foot as a wild roe
as asahel would not desist from the pursuit though warned abner was compelled to slay him in self defence
this originated a deadly feud between the leaders of the opposite parties for joab as next of kin to asahel was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood
however according to josephus in antiquities book chapter joab had forgiven abner for the death of his brother asahel the reason being that abner had slain asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned asahel and tried to knock the wind out of him with the butt of his spear
however probably by intervention of god it went through asahel
the bible says everyone stopped and looked
that shows that something like this never happened before
this battle was part of a civil war between david and ish bosheth
after this battle abner switched sides and granted david control over the tribe of benjamin
this act put abner in davids favor
for some time afterward the war was carried on the advantage being invariably on the side of david
at length ish bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing abner of sleeping with rizpah one of sauls concubines an alliance which according to contemporary notions would imply pretensions to the throne
abner was indignant at the rebuke and immediately opened negotiations with david who welcomed him on the condition that his wife michal should be restored to him
this was done and the proceedings were ratified by a feast
almost immediately after however joab who had been sent away perhaps intentionally returned and slew abner at the gate of hebron
the ostensible motive for the assassination was a desire to avenge asahel and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time
the conduct of david after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators
david had abner buried in hebron as stated in samuel and david said to all the people who were with him rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth and wail before abner
and king david went after the bier
and they buried abner in hebron and the king raised his voice and wept on abners grave and all the people wept
shortly after abners death ish bosheth was assassinated as he slept and david became king of the reunited kingdoms
son of the witch of en dor and the hero par excellence in the haggadah
conscious of his extraordinary strength he exclaimed if i could only catch hold of the earth i could shake it a saying which parallels the famous utterance of archimedes had i a fulcrum i could move the world
according to the midrash it would have been easier to move a wall six yards thick than one of the feet of abner who could hold the israelitish army between his knees
yet when his time came joab smote him
but even in his dying hour abner seized his foe like a ball of thread threatening to crush him
then the israelites came and pleaded for joabs life saying if thou killest him we shall be orphaned and our women and all our belongings will become a prey to the philistines
abner answered what can i do he has extinguished my light
the israelites replied entrust thy cause to the true judge
then abner released his hold upon joab and fell dead to the ground
his one sin
the rabbis agree that abner deserved this violent death though opinions differ concerning the exact nature of the sin that entailed so dire a punishment on one who was on the whole considered a righteous man
some reproach him that he did not use his influence with saul to prevent him from murdering the priests of nob convinced as he was of the innocence of the priests and of the propriety of their conduct toward david abner holding that as leader of the army david was privileged to avail himself of the urim and thummim
instead of contenting himself with passive resistance to sauls command to murder the priests abner ought to have tried to restrain the king
others maintain that abner did make such an attempt but in vain and that his one sin consisted in that he delayed the beginning of davids reign over israel by fighting him after sauls death for two years and a half
others again while excusing him for this in view of a tradition founded on gen
according to which there were to be two kings of the house of benjamin blame abner for having prevented a reconciliation between saul and david on the occasion when the latter in holding up the skirt of sauls robe showed how unfounded was the kings mistrust of him
saul was inclined to be pacified but abner representing to him that david might have found the piece of the garment anywhere possibly caught on a thorn prevented the reconciliation
moreover it was wrong in abner to permit israelitish youths to kill one another for sport
no reproach however attaches to him for the death of asahel since abner killed him in self defense
it is characteristic of the rabbinical view of the bible narratives that abner the warrior pure and simple is styled lion of the law and that even a specimen is given of a halakic discussion between him and doeg as to whether the law in deut
excluded ammonite and moabite women from the jewish community as well as men
doeg was of the opinion that david being descended from the moabitess ruth was not fit to wear the crown nor even to be considered a true israelite while abner maintained that the law affected only the male line of descent
when doegs dialectics proved more than a match for those of abner the latter went to the prophet samuel who not only supported abner in his view but utterly refuted doegs assertions
one of the most prominent families in jerusalem in the middle of the first century of the common era claimed descent from abner
the site known as the tomb of abner is located not far from the cave of the patriarchs in hebron and receives visitors throughout the year
many travelers have recorded visiting the tomb over the centuries
a rabbi in the th century records visiting the tomb as reprinted in elkan nathan adlers book jewish travellers in the middle ages firsthand accounts
the account states i jacob the son of r
nathaniel ha cohen journeyed with much difficulty but god helped me to enter the holy land and i saw the graves of our righteous patriarchs in hebron and the grave of abner the son of ner
adler postulates that the visit must have occurred prior to saladins capture of jerusalem in
rabbi moses basola records visiting the tomb in
he states abners grave is in the middle of hebron the muslims built a mosque over it
another visitor in the s states that at the entrance to the market in hebron at the top of the hill against the wall abner ben ner is buried in a church in a cave
this visit was recorded in sefer yihus ha tzaddiqim a collection of travelogues from
abraham moshe lunz reprinted the book in
menahem mendel of kamenitz considered the first hotelier in the land of israel wrote about the tomb of abner is his book korot ha itim which was translated into english as the book of the occurrences of the times to jeshurun in the land of israel
he states here i write of the graves of the righteous to which i paid my respects
hebron described above is the character and order of behavior of those coming to pray at the cave of ha machpelah
i went there between the stores over the grave of avner ben ner and was required to pay a yishmaeli the grave was in his courtyard to allow me to enter
the author and traveler j
benjamin mentioned visiting the tomb in his book eight years in asia and africa
he states on leaving the sepulchre of the patriarchs and proceeding on the road leading to the jewish quarter to the left of the courtyard is seen a turkish dwelling house by the side of which is a small grotto to which there is a descent of several steps
this is the tomb of abner captain of king saul
it is held in much esteem by the arabs and the proprietor of it takes care that it is always kept in the best order
he requires from those who visit it a small gratuity
the british scholar israel abrahams wrote in his book the book of delight and other papers hebron was the seat of davids rule over judea
abner was slain here by joab and was buried here they still show abners tomb in the garden of a large house within the city
by the pool at hebron were slain the murderers of ishbosheth
over the years the tomb fell into disrepair and neglect
it was closed to the public in
in a group of israeli women filed a petition with the supreme court requesting the government to reopen the tomb of abner
more requests were made over the years and eventually arrangements were made to have the site open to the general public on ten days throughout the year corresponding to the ten days that the isaac hall of the cave of the patriarchs is open
in early new mezuzot were affixed to the entrance of the site
ahmed i was the sultan of the ottoman empire from to
ahmeds reign is noteworthy for marking the first breach in the ottoman tradition of royal fratricide henceforth ottoman rulers would no longer systematically execute their brothers upon accession to the throne
he is also well known for his construction of the blue mosque one of the most famous mosques in turkey
ahmed was probably born in april at the manisa palace manisa when his father mehmed was still a prince and the governor of the sanjak of manisa
his mother was handan sultan
after his grandfather murad iiis death in his father came to constantinople and ascended the throne as sultan mehmed iii
mehmed ordered the execution of his nineteen half brothers
ahmeds elder brother ehzade mahmud was also executed by his father mehmed on june just before mehmeds own death on december
mahmud was buried along with his mother in a separate mausoleum built by ahmed in ehzade mosque constantinople
ahmed ascended the throne after his fathers death in at the age of thirteen when his powerful grandmother safiye sultan was still alive
with his accession to the throne the power struggle in the harem flared up between his mother handan sultan and his grandmother safiye sultan who in the previous reign had absolute power within the walls in the end with the support of ahmed the fight ended in favor of his mother
a far lost uncle of ahmed yahya resented his accession to the throne and spent his life scheming to become sultan
ahmed broke with the traditional fratricide following previous enthronements and did not order the execution of his brother mustafa
instead mustafa was sent to live at the old palace at bayezit along with their grandmother safiye sultan
this was most likely due to ahmeds young age he had not yet demonstrated his ability to sire children and mustafa was then the only other candidate for the ottoman throne
his brothers execution would have endangered the dynasty and thus he was spared
his mother tried to interfere in his affairs and influence his decision especially she wanted to control his communication and movements
in the earlier part of his reign ahmed i showed decision and vigor which were belied by his subsequent conduct
the wars in hungary and persia which attended his accession terminated unfavourably for the empire
its prestige was further tarnished in the treaty of zsitvatorok signed in whereby the annual tribute paid by austria was abolished
following the crushing defeat in the ottoman safavid war against the neighbouring rivals safavid empire led by shah abbas the great georgia azerbaijan and other vast territories in the caucasus were ceded back to persia per the treaty of nasuh pasha in territories that had been temporarily conquered in the ottoman safavid war
the new borders were drawn per the same line as confirmed in the peace of amasya of
during his reign the ruler of morocco was mulay zidan whose father and predecessor ahmad al mansur had paid a tribute of vassalage as a vassal of the ottomans until his death
the saadi civil wars had interrupted this tribute of vassalage but mulay zidan proposed to submit to it in order to protect himself from algiers and so he resumed paying the tribute to the ottomans
the ottoman safavid war had begun shortly before the death of ahmeds father mehmed iii
upon ascending the throne ahmed i appointed cigalazade yusuf sinan pasha as the commander of the eastern army
the army marched from constantinople on june which was too late and by the time it had arrived on the eastern front on november the safavid army had captured yerevan and entered the kars eyalet and could only be stopped in akhaltsikhe
despite the conditions being favourable sinan pasha decided to stay for the winter in van but then marched to erzurum to stop an incoming safavid attack
this caused unrest within the army and the year was practically wasted for the ottomans
in sinan pasha marched to take tabriz but the army was undermined by kse sefer pasha the beylerbey of erzurum marching independently from sinan pasha and consequently being taken prisoner by the safavids
the ottoman army was routed at urmia and had to flee firstly to van and then to diyarbekir
here sinan pasha sparked a rebellion by executing the beylerbey of aleppo canbulatolu hseyin pasha who had come to provide help upon the pretext that he had arrived too late
he soon died himself and the safavid army was able to capture ganja shirvan and shamakhi in azerbaijan
the long turkish war between the ottomans and the habsburg monarchy had been going on for over a decade by the time ahmed ascended the throne
grand vizier malko ali pasha marched to the western front from constantinople on june and arrived in belgrade but died there so sokolluzade lala mehmed pasha was appointed as the grand vizier and the commander of the western army
under mehmed pasha the western army recaptured pest and vc but failed to capture esztergom as the siege was lifted due to unfavourable weather and the objections of the soldiers
meanwhile the prince of transylvania stephen bocskay who struggled for the regions independence and had formerly supported the habsburgs sent a messenger to the porte asking for help
upon the promise of help his forces also joined the ottoman forces in belgrade
with this help the ottoman army besieged esztergom and captured it on november
bocskai with ottoman help captured nov zmky and forces under tiryaki hasan pasha took veszprm and palota
sarho ibrahim pasha the beylerbey of nagykanizsa attacked the austrian region of istria
however with jelali revolts in anatolia more dangerous than ever and a defeat in the eastern front mehmed pasha was called to constantinople
mehmed pasha suddenly died there whilst preparing to leave for the east
kuyucu murad pasha then negotiated the peace of zsitvatorok which abolished the tribute of ducats paid by austria and addressed the habsburg emperor as the equal of the ottoman sultan
the jelali revolts were a strong factor in the ottomans acceptance of the terms
this signaled the end of ottoman growth in europe
resentment over the war with the habsburgs and heavy taxation along with the weakness of the ottoman military response combined to make the reign of ahmed i the zenith of the jelali revolts
tavil ahmed launched a revolt soon after the coronation of ahmed i and defeated nasuh pasha and the beylerbey of anatolia kecdehan ali pasha
in tavil ahmed was offered the position of the beylerbey of shahrizor to stop his rebellion but soon afterwards he went on to capture harput
his son mehmed obtained the governorship of baghdad with a fake firman and defeated the forces of nasuh pasha sent to defeat him
meanwhile canbulatolu ali pasha united his forces with the druze sheikh manolu fahreddin to defeat the amir of tripoli seyfolu yusuf
he went on to take control of the adana area forming an army and issuing coins
his forces routed the army of the newly appointed beylerbey of aleppo hseyin pasha
grand vizier bonak dervish mehmed pasha was executed for the weakness he showed against the jelalis
he was replaced by kuyucu murad pasha who marched to syria with his forces to defeat the strong rebel army with great difficulty albeit with a decisive result on october
meanwhile he pretended to forgive the rebels in anatolia and appointed the rebel kalenderolu who was active in manisa and bursa as the sanjakbey of ankara
baghdad was recaptured in as well
canbulatolu ali pasha fled to constantinople and asked for forgiveness from ahmed i who appointed him to timioara and later belgrade but then executed him due to his misrule there
meanwhile kalenderolu was not allowed in the city by the people of ankara and rebelled again only to be crushed by murad pashas forces
kalenderolu ended up fleeing to persia
murad pasha then suppressed some smaller revolts in central anatolia and suppressed other jelali chiefs by inviting them to join the army
due to the widespread violence of the jelali revolts a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed
some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property
this deprived the porte of tax income and on september ahmed i issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers
he then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages
the new grand vizier nasuh pasha did not want to fight with the safavids
the safavid shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace treaty with which he would have to send loads of silk every year to constantinople
on november the treaty of nasuh pasha was signed which ceded all the lands the ottoman empire had gained in the war of back to persia and reinstated the boundaries
however the peace ended in when the shah did not send the loads of silk
on may grand vizier kz mehmed pasha was assigned to organize an attack on persia
mehmed pasha delayed the attack till the next year until when the safavids made their preparations and attacked ganja
in april mehmed pasha left aleppo with a large army and marched to yerevan where he failed to take the city and withdrew to erzurum
he was removed from his post and replaced by damat halil pasha
halil pasha went for the winter to diyarbekir while the khan of crimea canibek giray attacked the areas of ganja nakhichevan and julfa
ahmed i renewed trade treaties with england france and venice
in july the first ever trade treaty with the dutch republic was signed
he expanded the capitulations given to france specifying that merchants from spain ragusa genoa ancona and florence could trade under the french flag
sultan ahmed constructed the sultan ahmed mosque the magnum opus of the ottoman architecture across from the hagia sophia
the sultan attended the breaking of the ground with a golden pickaxe to begin the construction of the mosque complex
an incident nearly broke out after the sultan discovered that the blue mosque contained the same number of minarets as the grand mosque of mecca
ahmed became furious at this fault and became remorseful until the shaykh ul islam recommended that he should erect another minaret at the grand mosque of mecca and the matter was solved
ahmed became delightedly involved in the eleventh comprehensive renovations of the kaaba which had just been damaged by flooding
he sent craftsmen from constantinople and the golden rain gutter that kept rain from collecting on the roof of the kaba was successfully renewed
it was again during the era of sultan ahmed that an iron web was placed inside the zamzam well in mecca
the placement of this web about three feet below the water level was a response to lunatics who jumped into the well imagining a promise of a heroic death
in medina the city of the islamic prophet muhammad a new pulpit made of white marble and shipped from istanbul arrived in the mosque of muhammad and substituted the old worn out pulpit
it is also known that sultan ahmed erected two more mosques in uskudar on the asian side of istanbul however neither of them has survived
the sultan had a crest carved with the footprint of muhammad that he would wear on fridays and festive days and illustrated one of the most significant examples of affection to muhammad in ottoman history
engraved inside the crest was a poem he composed sultan ahmed was known for his skills in fencing poetry horseback riding and fluency in several languages
ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name bahti
ahmed patronized scholars calligraphers and pious men
hence he commissioned a book entitled the quintessence of histories to be worked upon by calligraphers
he also attempted to enforce conformance to islamic laws and traditions restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at friday prayers and paying alms to the poor in the proper way
ahmed i died of typhus and gastric bleeding on november at the topkap palace istanbul
he was buried in ahmed i mausoleum sultan ahmed mosque
he was succeeded by his younger half brother mustafa as sultan mustafa i
later three of ahmeds sons ascended to the throne osman ii murad iv and ibrahim
ahmed had two known consorts plus several unknown concubines mothers of the other princes and princesses
today ahmed i is remembered mainly for the construction of the sultan ahmed mosque one of the masterpieces of islamic architecture
the area in fatih around the mosque is today called sultanahmet
he died at topkap palace in constantinople and is buried in a mausoleum right outside the walls of the famous mosque
in the tv series ahmed i is portrayed by turkish actor ekin ko
ahmed ii was the sultan of the ottoman empire from to
ahmed ii was born on february or august the son of sultan ibrahim and muazzez sultan
on october ahmed along with his brothers mehmed and suleiman were circumcised
during the reigns of his older brothers ahmed was imprisoned in kafes and he stayed there almost years
during his reign ahmed ii devoted most of his attention to the wars against the habsburgs and related foreign policy governmental and economic issues
of these the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system
following the recovery of belgrade under his predecessor suleiman ii the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the danube with the habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it and the ottomans attempting ultimately unsuccessfully to regain the initiative north of it
among the most important features of ahmeds reign was his reliance on kprlzade fazl mustafa pasha
following his accession to the throne ahmed ii confirmed fazl mustafa pasha in his office as grand vizier
in office from fazl mustafa pasha was from the kprl family of grand viziers and like most of his kprl predecessors in the same office was an able administrator and military commander
like his father kprl mehmed pasha before him fazl mustafa pasha ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself
he overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars
he also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the balkans and anatolia
in october fazl mustafa pasha recaptured belgrade a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers danube and sava in ottoman hands since the fortress had been conquered by the habsburgs in
fazl mustafa pashas victory at belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the ottomans hope that the military debacles of the s which had led to the loss of hungary and transylvania an ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro istanbul hungarian princes could be reversed
however the ottoman success proved ephemeral
on august fazl mustafa pasha suffered a devastating defeat at the battle of slankamen at the hands of louis william the habsburg commander in chief in hungary nicknamed trkenlouis for his victories against the ottomans
in the confrontation recognized by contemporaries as the bloodiest battle of the century the ottomans suffered heavy losses men including the grand vizier
with him the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the kprl family who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the ottoman military
under fazl mustafa pashas successors the ottomans suffered further defeats
in june the habsburgs conquered oradea the seat of an ottoman governor since
in they attempted to recapture oradea but to no avail
on january they surrendered the fortress of gyula the center of an ottoman sanjak since
with the fall of gyula the only territory still in ottoman hands in hungary was to the east of the river tisza and to the south of the river maros with its center at timioara
three weeks later on february ahmed ii died in edirne palace
in addition to his daughters ahmed ii was deeply attached to his niece mmglsm sultan daughter of his half brother mehmed iv so much so that he treated her as if she were his own daughter
ahmed iii was sultan of the ottoman empire and a son of sultan mehmed iv
his mother was glnu sultan originally named evmania voria who was an ethnic greek
he was born at hacolu pazarck in dobruja
he succeeded to the throne in on the abdication of his brother mustafa ii
nevehirli damat ibrahim pasha and the sultans daughter fatma sultan directed the government from to a period referred to as the tulip era
during the initial days of ahmed iiis reign significant efforts were made to appease the janissaries
however ahmeds effectiveness in dealing with the janissaries who had elevated him to the sultanate was limited
grand vizier orlulu ali pasha whom ahmed appointed provided valuable assistance in administrative affairs and implemented new measures for the treasury
he supported ahmed in his struggles against rival factions and provided stability to the government
ahmed was an avid reader skilled in calligraphy and knowledgeable on history and poetry
sultan ahmed was born on december
his father was sultan mehmed iv and his mother was glnu sultan originally named evmenia
his birth occurred in hacolupazar where mehmed stayed to hunt on his return from poland in while glnu was pregnant at that time
in he and his brother prince mustafa were circumcised
during the same ceremony their sisters hatice sultan and fatma sultan were married to musahip mustafa pasha and kara mustafa pasha respectively
the celebrations lasted days
he grew up in the edirne palace
his schooling began during one of the sporadic visits of the court to istanbul following a courtly ceremony called bad i basmala which took place on august in the istavroz palace
he was brought up in the imperial harem in edirne with a traditional princely education studying the quran the hadiths and the fundamentals of islamic sciences history poetry and music under the supervision of private tutors
one of his tutors was chief mufti feyzullah efendi
ahmed was apparently curious and intellectual in nature spending most of his time reading and practising calligraphy
the poems that he wrote manifest his profound knowledge of poetry history islamic theology and philosophy
he was also interested in calligraphy which he had studied with the leading court calligraphers primarily with hafz osman efendi who influenced his art immensely and therefore practiced it because of the influence of his elder brother the future sultan mustafa ii who also became a notable calligrapher
during his princehood in edirne ahmed made friends with a bright officer scribe ibrahim from the city of nevehir who was to become one of the outstanding grand viziers of his future reign
from following the deposition of his father he lived in isolation for sixteen years in the palaces of edirne and istanbul
during this period he dedicated himself to calligraphy and intellectual activities
the edirne succession occurred between august to august
under mustafa istanbul had been out of control for a long time
as arrests and executions mounted theft and robbery incidents became common
the people were dissatisfied with the poor governing of the empire
mustafa was deposed by the janissaries and ahmed who succeeded him to the throne on august
the first friday salute was held in bayezid mosque
fndkll mehmed aa welcomed the new sultan at the harem gate on the hasoda side entered the arm brought him to the cardigan i saadet department and placed them on the throne and were among the first to pay tribute to him
as part of the fief system ahmed reorganized the land law in
bringing order to land ownership reduced the crime wave and brought peace to the troubled empire
due to his ardent support of the new laws ahmed was given the title law giver a title given to only three sultans earlier bayezid ii selim i and suleiman i
in the first three years of his reign ahmed appointed four separate grand viziers
however the government only gained some stability after the appointment of orlulu ali pasha in may
ahmed iii cultivated good relations with france doubtless in view of russias menacing attitude
he afforded refuge in ottoman territory to charles xii of sweden after the swedish defeat at the hands of peter i of russia in the battle of poltava of
in charles xii convinced sultan ahmed iii to declare war against russia and the ottoman forces under baltac mehmet pasha won a major victory at the battle of prut
in the aftermath russia returned azov back to the ottomans agreed to demolish the fortress of taganrog and others in the area and to stop interfering in the affairs of the polish lithuanian commonwealth
forced against his will into war with russia ahmed iii came nearer than any ottoman sovereign before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival whose armies his grand vizier nevehirli damat ibrahim pasha succeeded in completely surrounding at the pruth river campaign in
the subsequent ottoman victories against russia enabled the ottoman empire to advance to moscow had the sultan wished
however this was halted as a report reached istanbul that the safavids were invading the ottoman empire causing a period of panic turning the sultans attention away from russia
this success alarmed austria and in april emperor charles vi provoked the porte into a declaration of war
the unsuccessful battle also commanded by silahdar ali pasha ended with the treaty of passarowitz signed on july according to which belgrade banat and wallachia were ceded to austria
this failure was a disappointment for ahmed as the treaty led to istanbuls economy suffering from increased inflation
nevehirli damat ibrahim pasha who was the second leading figure of the empire after ahmed had joined the morea campaign in and was appointed as the city of nishs minister of finance the following year
this post helped him realize the downturn of the states finances which led him to avoid war as much as possible during his vizierate
ibrahim pashas policy of peace suited ahmed well since he had no wish to lead any military campaigns in addition to the fact that his interest in art and culture made him reluctant to leave his istanbul
while shooting competitions were held in okmeydan istanbul with the idea of increasing the morale of the soldiers and the people a new warship was launched in tersane i amire
he tried three grand viziers at short intervals
instead of hasan pasha he appointed kalaylikoz ahmed pasha on september and baltac mehmed pasha on december
in a conspiracy led by eypl ali aa was unearthed to bring the sultan off the throne
what resulted were that necks were ordered to be cut in front of the bab i hmayun
ahmed iii left the finances of the ottoman empire in a flourishing condition which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortionate procedures
he was a cultivated patron of literature and art and it was in his time that the first printing press was authorized to use either the arabic or turkish languages it was set up in istanbul and operated by ibrahim muteferrika
it was in his reign that an important change in the government of the danubian principalities was introduced previously the porte had appointed hospodars usually native moldavian and wallachian boyars to administer those provinces after the russian campaign of during which peter the great found an ally in moldavia prince dimitrie cantemir the porte began overtly deputizing phanariote greeks in that region and extended the system to wallachia after prince stefan cantacuzino established links with prince eugene of savoy
the phanariotes constituted a kind of dhimmi nobility which supplied the porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state
the ambassadors of safavid iran and the archduchy of austria were well received when they came from to
in the year the mughal emperor jahandar shah a grandson of aurangzeb sent gifts to the ottoman sultan ahmed iii and referred to himself as the ottoman sultans devoted admirer
the mughal emperor farrukhsiyar another grandson of aurangzeb is also known to have sent a letter to the ottomans but this time it was received by the grand vizier nevehirli damad ibrahim pasha
the letter provided a graphic description of the efforts of the mughal commander syed hassan ali khan barha fighting against the rajput and maratha rebellion
sultan ahmed iii had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged on september a mutinous riot of seventeen janissaries led by the albanian patrona halil was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection this consequently led the sultan to give up his throne
ahmed voluntarily led his nephew mahmud i to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as sultan of the empire
he then retired to the kafes previously occupied by mahmud and died at topkap palace after six years of confinement
ahmed iii commissioned the building of water claps fountains park waterfalls and three libraries one inside the topkap palace with the famous lines ahmed was a master in the writings on plates which have survived
the basmala at the topkapi palace apartment door with its plates in the skdar yeni mosque are among them
a library was built by ahmed in situated next to the tomb entrance of turhan sultan the structure has stone brick alternate meshed walls is square shaped and covered with a flattened dome with an octagonal rim which is provided with pendentives
there are original pen works left in the pendentives and dome of the library
in an egyptian galleon near the gmrk pier caught fire and burned which resulted in the deaths of people
while nevehirli damat ibrahim pasha continued his preparations for his return to istanbul a fire broke out in the city
the districts of unkapan azapkap zeyrek fatih sarahane horhor etmeydan molla grani altmermer ayazma gate kantarclar vefa vez neciler old rooms acemiolanlar barracks ukur eme langa davudpaa were burned from the fire
a large three minute earthquake occurred on may
while the city walls of istanbul were destroyed in the earthquake people died in izmit and yalova was destroyed
reconstruction work followed after the quake ended in istanbul
the most meaningful element to reflect the cultural aspect or weight of these works today is the topkap palace enderun library which was built in that year
a rich foundation was established for this institution which is also known as the sultan ahmed i salis library which has a face to face with its architectural and valuable manuscripts
ahmed iii is known to be the sultan with the largest family of the ottoman dynasty
the hostess of his harem was dilhayat kalfa known to be one of the greatest turkish composeress of the early modern period
ahmed lived in kafes of the topkapi palace for six years following his deposition where he fell ill and died on july
he was buried in his grandmothers tomb in turhan sultan mausoleum in new mosque at eminn in istanbul
in voltaires candide the eponymous main character meets the deposed ahmed iii on a ship from venice to constantinople
the sultan is in the company of five other deposed european monarchs and he tells candide who initially doubts his credentials i am not jesting my name is achmet iii
for several years i was sultan i dethroned my brother my nephew dethroned me they cut off the heads of my viziers i am ending my days in the old seraglio my nephew sultan mahmoud sometimes allows me to travel for my health and i have come to spend the carnival at venice
this episode was taken up by the modern turkish writer nedim grsel as the setting of his novel le voyage de candide istanbul
in fact there is no evidence of the deposed sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels nor did voltaire assert that it had any actual historical foundation
the ainu are an ethnic group who reside in northern japan including hokkaido and northeast honshu as well as the land surrounding the sea of okhotsk such as sakhalin the kuril islands the kamchatka peninsula and the khabarovsk krai they have occupied these areas known to them as ainu mosir since before the arrival of the modern yamato and russians
these regions are often referred to as and its inhabitants as in historical japanese texts
official estimates place the total ainu population in japan at
unofficial estimates place the total population at or higher as the near total assimilation of the ainu into japanese society has resulted in many individuals of ainu descent having no knowledge of their ancestry
the ainu are one of the few ethnic minorities in the japanese islands
they were subject to forced assimilation and colonization by the far larger yamato population of japan since at least the th century
japanese assimilation policies in the th century around the meiji restoration included forcing ainu peoples off their land this in turn forced them to give up traditional ways of life such as subsistence hunting and fishing
ainu people were not allowed to practice their religion and were placed into japanese language schools where speaking the ainu language was forbidden
in there were about native ainu speakers in there were about
in recent years there have been increasing efforts to revitalize the ainu language
this peoples most widely known ethnonym means human in the ainu language particularly as opposed to divine beings
ainu also identify themselves as
official documents use both names
the name first appeared as in a latin manuscript titled
this document gives the native name of hokkaido as or land of the ainu
the terms and did not come into common use as ethnonyms until the early th century
the ethnonym first appeared in an german encyclopedia article
neither european nor japanese sources conceived of the ainu as a distinct ethnic group until the late s
the ainu were also called the kuye by their neighbors
the qing dynasty called sakhalin
the island was also called
the word used by the qing is most probably related to kuyi the name given to the sakhalin ainu by their nivkh and nanai neighbors
when the ainu migrated onto the mainland the chinese described a strong kui presence in the area otherwise dominated by the gilemi or jilimi
related names were in widespread use in the region for example the kuril ainu called themselves
the old japanese exonym was coined according to the kojiki den from as a reference to their hairiness and savagery
the term is considered an insult by contemporary ainu
the ainu are considered the native people of hokkaido southern sakhalin and the kurils
early ainu speaking groups were also present in northern honshu where their descendants are today known as the matagi hunters who still use a large amount of ainu vocabulary in their dialect and also migrated to the kamchatka peninsula
ainu toponyms support the historical view that the ainu people lived in several places throughout northern honshu mostly along the western coast and in the thoku region
there is also evidence that ainu speakers lived in the amur region through ainu loanwords found in the uilta and ulch languages
the ancestors of the ainu who were referred to as emishi came under japanese subjugation starting in the th century and were pushed to the northern islands
active contact between the wa jin and the ainu of ezogashima began in the th century
the ainu formed a society of hunter gatherers surviving mainly by hunting and fishing
they followed a religion that was based on natural phenomena
after the mongols conquered the jin dynasty they suffered raids by the nivkh and udege peoples
in response the mongols established an administration post at nurgan at the junction of the amur and amgun rivers in and forced the submission of the two peoples
in the ainu invaded the land of the nivkh people
the ainu also started an expedition into the amur region which was then controlled by the yuan dynasty resulting in reprisals by the mongols who invaded sakhalin
from the nivkh perspective their surrender to the mongols essentially established a military alliance against the ainu who had invaded their lands
according to the history of yuan a group of people known as the guwei from sakhalin invaded and fought with the jilimi every year
on november the mongols attacked the ainu
the ainu resisted the mongol invasions but by had been subdued
they paid tribute to the mongol yuan dynasty at posts in wuliehe nanghar and boluohe
the chinese ming dynasty placed sakhalin under its system for subjugated peoples
from to the ming established an outpost called the nurgan regional military commission near the ruins of tyr on the siberian mainland which continued operating until the mid s
there is some evidence that the ming eunuch admiral yishiha reached sakhalin in during one of his expeditions to the lower amur and granted ming titles to a local chieftain
the ming recruited headmen from sakhalin for administrative posts such as commander assistant commander and official charged with subjugation
in one such assistant commander alige brought marten pelts as tribute to the wuliehe post
in four other assistant commanders also presented tribute
according to the ming veritable records these posts like the position of headman were hereditary and passed down the patrilineal line
during these tributary missions the headmen would bring their sons who later inherited their titles
in return for tribute the ming awarded them with silk uniforms
nivkh women in sakhalin married han chinese ming officials when the ming took tribute from sakhalin and the amur river region
due to ming rule in manchuria chinese cultural and religious influence such as chinese new year the chinese god and motifs such as dragons spirals and scrolls spread among the ainu nivkh and amur natives such as the udeghes ulchis and nanais
these groups also adopted material goods and practices such as agriculture husbandry heating iron cooking pots silk and cotton
the manchu qing dynasty which came to power in china in called sakhalin kuyedao or kuye fiyaka
the manchus called it sagaliyan ula angga hada
the qing first asserted influence over sakhalin after the treaty of nerchinsk which defined the stanovoy mountains as the border between the qing and the russian empires
in the following year the qing sent forces to the amur estuary and demanded that the residents including the sakhalin ainu pay tribute
this was followed by several further visits to the island as part of the qing effort to map the area
to enforce its influence the qing sent soldiers and mandarins across sakhalin reaching most parts of the island except the southern tip
the qing imposed a fur tribute system on the regions inhabitants
the qing dynasty established an office in ningguta situated midway along the mudan river to handle fur from the lower amur and sakhalin
tribute was supposed to be brought to regional offices but the lower amur and sakhalin were considered too remote so the qing sent officials directly to these regions every year to collect tribute and to present awards
by the s the qing had appointed senior figures among the indigenous communities as clan chief or village chief
in hala gasban and households were registered as tribute bearers in sakhalin
manchu officials gave tribute missions rice salt other necessities and gifts during the duration of their mission
tribute missions occurred during the summer months
during the reign of the qianlong emperor a trade post existed at delen upstream of kiji lake according to rinzo mamiya
there were people at the market during mamiyas stay there
local native sakhalin chiefs had their daughters taken as wives by manchu officials as sanctioned by the qing dynasty when the qing exercised jurisdiction in sakhalin and took tribute from them
in matsumae kinhiro the second daimy of matsumae domain in hokkaid sent sat kamoemon and kakizaki kuroudo on an expedition to sakhalin
one of the matsumae explorers kod shzaemon stayed in the island in the winter of and sailed along the east coast to taraika in the spring of
the tokugawa bakufu granted the matsumae clan exclusive rights to trade with the ainu in the northern part of the island
later the matsumae began to lease out trading rights to japanese merchants and contact between japanese and ainu became more extensive
throughout this period ainu groups competed with each other to import goods from the japanese and epidemic diseases such as smallpox reduced the population
in an early colonization attempt a japanese settlement was established at tomari on sakhalins southern end in
in the s the influence of the japanese tokugawa shogunate on the ainu of southern sakhalin increased significantly
by the beginning of the th century the japanese economic zone extended midway up the east coast to taraika
with the exception of the nayoro ainu located on the west coast in close proximity to china most ainu stopped paying tribute to the qing dynasty
the matsumae clan was nominally in charge of sakhalin but they neither protected nor governed the ainu there
instead they extorted the ainu for chinese silk which they sold in honshu as matsumaes special product
to obtain chinese silk the ainu fell into debt owing much fur to the santan who lived near the qing office
the ainu also sold the silk uniforms given to them by the qing which made up the majority of what the japanese knew as nishiki and jittoku
as dynastic uniforms the silk was of considerably higher quality than that traded at nagasaki and enhanced matsumae prestige as exotic items
eventually the tokugawa government realizing that they could not depend on the matsumae took control of sakhalin in
from to the tokugawa shogunate took direct control of southern hokkaido
japan proclaimed sovereignty over sakhalin in and in mamiya rinz claimed that it was an island
during this period ainu women were separated from their husbands and either subjected to rape or forcibly married to japanese men
meanwhile ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten year terms of service
policies of family separation and assimilation combined with the impact of smallpox caused the ainu population to drop significantly in the early th century
in the th century there were ainu but by there were only about ainu in hokkaido in sakhalin and around in the kuril islands
despite their growing influence in the area in the early th century as a result of these policies the tokugawa shogunate was unable to gain a monopoly on ainu trade with those on the asian mainland even by the year
santan traders a group composed mostly of the ulchi nanai and oroch peoples of the amur river commonly interacted with the ainu people independent of the japanese government especially in the northern part of hokkaido
in addition to their trading ventures santan traders sometimes kidnapped or purchased ainu women from rishiri to become their wives
this further escalated japans presence in the area as the tokugawa shogunate believed a monopoly on the santan trade would better protect the ainu people
in the imperial government established the hokkaid development commission as part of the meiji restoration
researcher katarina sjberg quotes babas account of the japanese governments reasoning as a result of the treaty of saint petersburg the kuril islandsalong with their ainu inhabitantscame under japanese administration
in the japanese government passed an act labeling the ainu as former aborigines with the idea that they would assimilate
this resulted in the japanese government taking the land where the ainu people lived and placing it from then on under japanese control
also at this time the ainu were granted automatic japanese citizenship effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group
the ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land language religion and customs assimilated into those of the japanese
their land was distributed to the yamato japanese settlers to create and maintain farms in the model of western industrial agriculture
it was known as colonization at the time but later by the euphemism opening up undeveloped land
additionally factories like flour mills and beer breweries along with mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines during a development period that lasted until
during this time the ainu were ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing
the same act applied to the native ainu on sakhalin after its annexation as karafuto prefecture
the ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination as both the japanese government and mainstream population regarded them as dirty and primitive barbarians
the majority of ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the meiji restoration which saw the introduction of hokkaido into the japanese empire and the privatization of traditional ainu lands
during the th and th centuries the japanese government denied the rights of the ainu to their traditional cultural practices such as hunting gathering and speaking their native language
the legal denial of ainu cultural practices mostly stemmed from the hokkaido former aborigines protection act
this law and its associated policies were designed to fully integrate the ainu into japanese society while erasing ainu culture and identity
the ainus position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the japanese government that can still be felt today
intermarriage between japanese and ainu was actively promoted by the ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring
as a result many ainu today are indistinguishable from their japanese neighbors but some ainu japanese are interested in traditional ainu culture
for example oki born as the child of an ainu father and a japanese mother became a musician who plays the traditional ainu instrument the
there are also many small towns in the southeastern or hidaka region of hokkaido where ethnic ainu live such as in nibutani
from the early s christian missionary work was conducted among the ainu
the anglican communion missionaries included the rt
philip fyson bishop of hokkaido and the rev
john batchelor
batchelor wrote extensively in english about the beliefs and daily life of the ainu in yezo and his publications are a source of photographs of the japanese and ainu close to the missions
the discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the ainu have manifested in lower levels of education income and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically japanese counterparts
the ainu community in hokkaido in received welfare payments at a times higher rate than that of hokkaido as a whole
they also had an lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a lower enrollment into college from high school
due to this noticeable and growing gap the japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the ainus standard of living nationwide
the japanese government will provide million beginning in to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter
the existence of the ainu has challenged the notion of ethnic homogeneity in post wwii japan
after the demise of the multi ethnic empire of japan in successive governments forged a single japanese identity by advocating monoculturalism and denying the existence of more than one ethnic group in japan
following the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples in hokkaido politicians pressured the government to recognize ainu rights
prime minister fukuda yasuo answered a parliamentary question on may by stating on june the national diet of japan passed a non binding bipartisan resolution calling upon the government to recognize the ainu as indigenous people
in eleven years after this resolution the diet finally passed an act recognizing the ainu as an indigenous people of japan
despite this recognition of the ainu as an ethnically distinct group political figures in japan continue to define ethnic homogeneity as key to the overall japanese national identity
for example politician tar as notably claimed in no other country but this one has lasted for as long as years with one language one ethnic group and one dynasty
the ainu are regarded as having descended from the indigenous japanese hunter gatherers who lived in japan during the jmon period
the exact origins of the early ainu remain unclear but it is generally agreed to be linked to the satsumon culture of the epi jmon period with later influences from the nearby okhotsk culture
the ainu culture may be better described as an ainu cultural complex taking into account the regional variable subgroups of ainu peoples
while the ainu can be considered a continuation of the indigenous jomon culture they also display links to surrounding cultures pointing to a larger cultural complex flourishing around the sea of okhotsk
some authors have also described the development of the ainu culture as the resistance of a jomon society to the emerging japanese state
one of their or legends tells that he ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the children of the sun came
the historical ainu economy was based on farming as well as hunting fishing and gathering
the general consensus among historians is to associate the ainu with the satsumon culture which was located in an area stretching from northern honshu to hokkaido
linguists such as juha janhunen and alexander vovin argue for a satsumon origin of ainu dialects with deeper links to cultures centered in central or northern honshu
this is in part supported by ainu derived loanwords observed in eastern old japanese and the probable distant link between the ainu and the emishi
it has also been noted that the okhotsk culture played a role in the formation of the later ainu culture
the origin of the okhotsk culture itself is subject to research
while okhotsk remains display affinity to the modern nivkh people of northern sakhalin both also display affinities to the jmon peoples of japan pointing to a possible heterogeneous makeup of okhotsk society
satsumon pottery has been found among okhotsk sites pointing to a complex network of contacts in the wider area around the sea of okhotsk
the emergence of the ainu culture is henceforth primarily attributed to the satsumon culture which later received some contributions from the okhotsk culture via cultural contacts in northern hokkaido after the satsumon culture expanded northwards and into sakhalin
this view has been corroborated by later analyses
while the view that the ancient emishi were identical to the ainu has been largely disproven by current research the exact relationship between them is still under dispute
it is agreed that at least some emishi spoke ainu languages and were ethnically related to the ainu
the emishi may however have also included non ainu groups which can either be associated with groups distantly related to the ainu but forming their own ethnicity or early japonic speakers outside the influence of the yamato court
the emishi display clear material culture links to the ainu of hokkaido
based on ainu like toponyms throughout tohoku it is argued that the emishi like the ainu descended from the epi jmon tribes and initially spoke ainu related languages
the term emishi in the nara period referred to people who lived in the tohoku region and whose lifestyle and culture differed markedly from that of the yamato people it was originally a highly cultural and political concept with no racial distinction
from the mid heian period onward emishi who did not fall under the governance of the yamato kingship were singled out as northern emishi
they began to be referred to as ezo
the first written reference to ezo which is thought to be ainu can be found in suwa daimyjin ekotoba which was written in
indeed ainu have lived in sakhalin the kuril islands hokkaido and the northern tohoku region since the th century
an analysis of ainu male individuals found that the majority belong to y dna haplogroup d m while a minority belongs to haplogroup c m
d m is found throughout the japanese archipelago with very high frequencies among the ainu of hokkaido
c m is found more commonly among populations from northeast asia and central asia
another analysis found that one out of four ainu men belonged to haplogroup c m while the remaining three belonged to haplogroup d m
an analysis of ainu individuals found that around of their mtdna subclades are unique to the ainu while the remaining haplogroups are shared with other asian populations especially with the nivkhs in northern sakhalin and the koryaks on the kamchatka peninsula
of the ainu individuals around belong to n around to d around to m and around to g the minor haplogroups are a b f and an unclassified subclade of m not belonging to m m cz d or g
the ainu appear genetically most closely related to the jmon period peoples of japan
previous genetic analyses of jomon remains found them to represent a deeply diverged east asian lineage
the jomon lineage is inferred to have diverged from ancient east asians before the divergence between ancient northern east asians and ancient southern east asians but after the divergence of the basal tianyuan man and or hoabinhians
beyond their broad affinity with eastern asian lineages the jomon also display a weak affinity for ancient north eurasians which may be associated with the introduction of microblade technology to northeast asia and northern east asia during the last glacial maximum via the ane or ancient paleo siberians
the genetic makeup of the ainu represents a deep branch of east asian diversity
compared to contemporary east asian populations the ainu share a closer genetic relationship with northeast siberians
the ainu also display a relative closer genetic affinity with lowland east asians than highland east asians and may have contributed some ancestry to surrounding populations around the sea of okhotsk
differences in the frequency of the derived edar gene variant between the ainu and contemporary east asians suggest that the ancestors of the ainu may not have shared the selective pressures with other ancestral east asian populations
the ainu however share two variants in the adh gene cluster with other east asians at high frequency unlike tibetans and sherpa raising the possibility that selective pressure on these variants was different in the high altitude environments
the closest modern ethnic groups to the ainu are the ryukyuans in southern japan followed by contemporary japanese people
compared with other east asian populations the ainu are an outgroup pointing to long lasting isolation after their divergence
by analyzing the snp loci of ainu individuals it was found that they carry genes associated with facial structure found among europeans and hair and tooth morphology found among east asians
genetic analyses of hla i and hla ii genes as well as hla a b and drb gene frequencies placed the ainu in an intermediate position between indigenous peoples of the americas and contemporary northeast asians
studies on modern day ainu estimate that they derive between and of their ancestry from the jmon lineage
another study on modern ainu individuals found that they derive c
of their ancestry directly from the jmon people c
from the okhotsk people and from the yamato japanese corresponding with historical events
ainu men were first recruited into the japanese military in
sixty four ainu served in the russo japanese war eight of whom died in battle or from illness contracted during military service
two received the order of the golden kite granted for bravery leadership or command in battle
in the news block world watch gave an estimate of fewer than remaining speakers of the ainu language
in linguist alexander vovin placed the number at fewer than speakers characterizing the language as almost extinct
because so few present day speakers are left study of the ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research
historically the status of the ainu language was rather high and was used by early russian and japanese administrative officials to communicate with each other and with the ainu people
despite the small number of native speakers of ainu there is an active movement to revitalize the language mainly in hokkaido but also elsewhere such as in kanto
ainu oral literature has been documented both in hopes of safeguarding it for future generations and for use as a teaching tool for language learners
as of there were an increasing number of second language learners especially in hokkaido
the resurgence of ainu culture and language is in large part due to the pioneering efforts of the late ainu folklorist activist and former diet member shigeru kayano himself a native speaker
he first opened an ainu language school in funded by ainu kyokai
although some researchers have attempted to show that the ainu and japanese languages are related modern scholars have rejected the idea that the relationship goes beyond contact such as the mutual borrowing of words
no attempt to show a relationship with ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance and linguists currently classify ainu as a language isolate
most ainu people speak either japanese or russian
the ainu language has no indigenous system of writing and has historically been transliterated using japanese kana or russian cyrillic
it was typically written either in katakana or in the latin alphabet
many of the ainu dialects especially those from different extremities of hokkaido are not mutually intelligible
however all ainu speakers understand the classic ainu language of the a form of ainu epic
without a writing system the ainu were masters of narration with the and other forms of narration such as tales being committed to memory and related at gatherings that often lasted many hours or even days
concepts expressed with prepositions in english such as to from by in and at appear as postpositional forms in ainu
whereas prepositions come before the word they modify postpositions come after it
a single sentence in ainu can comprise many added or agglutinated sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas
traditional ainu culture is quite different from japanese culture
according to tanaka sakurako from the university of british columbia the ainu culture can be included into a wider northern circumpacific region referring to various indigenous cultures of northeast asia and beyond the bering strait in north america
the ainu culture developed from the th century to the present day
while most ainu in japan now live outwardly similar lives to the wajin due to assimilation policies many still maintain their ainu identity and respect for traditional ainu ways known as ainu puri
the distinctive ainu patterns and oral literature have been designated as hokkaido heritage
ainu society was traditionally organized into small villages called kotan typically located in river basins or along seashores where food was readily available particularly in rivers where salmon traveled upstream
in early modern times ainu were forced to relocate their kotan near japanese fishing grounds to provide labor
as a result traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around fishing grounds
the ainu social structure included chiefs but judicial functions were not entrusted to them
instead an indefinite number of community members sat in judgment upon criminals
capital punishment did not exist nor did the community resort to imprisonment
beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty
however in the case of murder the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of their feet were severed
never shaving after a certain age the men have full beards and moustaches
men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head trimmed semi circularly behind
the women tattoo their mouths and sometimes their forearms
the mouth tattoos start at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip gradually increasing in size
the soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark is used for color
traditional ainu dress consists of a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree called or
the various styles consist generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves folded around the body and tied with a band around the waist
the sleeves end at the wrist or forearm and the length generally is to the calves
women also wear an undergarment of japanese cloth
in winter the skins of animals are worn with leggings of deerskin and in sakhalin boots made from the skin of dogs or salmon
ainu culture regards earrings traditionally made from grapevines as gender neutral
women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay
modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices
their traditional habitations are reed thatched huts the largest about square without partitions and having a fireplace in the center
there is no chimney there is only a hole at the angle of the roof
one window sits on the eastern side along with two doors
the house of the village head is used as a public meeting place when one is needed
another kind of traditional ainu house is called
the chise is typically oriented east to west or parallel to a river with the entrance on the west side also serving as a storeroom
it has three windows including the sacred rorun puyar on the east side through which gods enter and leave and ceremonial tools are taken in and out
the ainu regard this window as sacred and are told never to look in through it
a chise has a fireplace near the entrance
a husband and wife would traditionally sit on the fireplaces left side
children and guests would sit facing them on the fireplaces right side
the chise has a platform for valuables called iyoykir behind the shiso
the ainu place sintoko and ikayop there
traditional ainu cuisine consists of the meat of bears foxes wolves badgers oxen and horses as well as fish fowl millet vegetables herbs and roots
the ainu traditionally never eat raw fish or meat always boiling or roasting it
they also cultivated crops such as millet foxtail millet and barnyard millet which were used to make a type of sake called tonoto for ceremonial purposes
salmon was particularly important referred to as kamuy chep or shipe
in autumn large quantities of salmon were caught and processed into dried fish for preservation
this served not only as a staple food but also as a major trade item with the japanese
the ainu also made extensive use of the bulbs of the cardiocrinum cordatum from which they extracted and preserved starch
this tradition of starch usage made it easy for them to adopt potatoes when they were introduced
ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside ainu communities
only a few restaurants in japan mainly in tokyo and hokkaido serve traditional ainu dishes the functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs
rather an indefinite number of a communitys members sat in judgment upon its criminals
capital punishment did not exist nor did the community resort to imprisonment
beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty
however in the case of murder the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of their feet were severed
the ainu traditionally hunt from late autumn to early summer in part because in late autumn plant gathering salmon fishing and other activities of securing food come to an end and hunters readily find game in fields and mountains in which plants have withered
a village typically possesses a hunting ground of its own or several villages use a joint hunting territory called an
heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or on joint hunting territory
the ainu traditionally hunt ussuri brown bears asian black bears ezo deer hares red foxes japanese raccoon dogs and other animals
ezo deer are a particularly important food resource for the ainu as are salmon
the ainu also hunt sea eagles such as white tailed sea eagles along with ravens and other birds
the ainu hunted eagles for their tail feathers which they used in trade with the japanese
historically the ainu hunted sea otters and traded their pelts in the japanese market
the ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison coated points
they obtained the poison called from the roots and stalks of aconites
the recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family
they enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dogs bane boiled juice of mekuragumo matsumomushi tobacco and other ingredients
they also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers
they traditionally hunt in groups with dogs
before hunting particularly for bears and similar animals they may pray to the the house guardian goddess to convey their wishes for a large catch and to the god of mountains for safe hunting
the ainu traditionally hunt bears during the spring thaw
at that time bears are weak because they havent eaten during their long hibernation
ainu hunters catch hibernating bears or bears that have just left hibernation dens
when they hunt bears in summer they use a spring trap loaded with an arrow called an
the ainu usually use arrows to hunt deer
also they drive deer into a river or sea and shoot them with arrows
for a large catch a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death
fishing is important to ainu culture
they largely catch trout in summer and salmon in autumn as well as dace and other fish
spears called were often used
other methods were fishing fishing and fishing
many villages were built near rivers or along the coast
each village or individual had a definite river fishing territory
outsiders could not freely fish there and needed to ask the owner
japanese lacquerware was used in everyday life as tableware and often used in ceremonies such as the cups used to offer alcohol when praying to the kamui
lacquerware was often treated as treasure and it was also used as containers for storing other treasures
one of the characteristics of ainu lacquerware is that it is almost entirely imported from the south of honshu
some pieces may have been lacquered in matsumae in southern hokkaido but since the technique of lacquering is from honshu lacquerware can be considered an introduced item among ainu folk implements
there are examples of spatulas and other objects used by the ainu people for ceremonial purposes that remain in clusters of the same size and some are specifically produced for trading with the ainu

a village is called a in the ainu language
were traditionally located in river basins and along seashores where food was readily available particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon traveled upstream
in early modern times the ainu people were forced to labor at japanese fishing grounds
ainu were also forced to relocate to near fishing grounds so that the japanese could secure a labor force
when the japanese moved to other fishing grounds ainu were forced to accompany them
as a result the traditional disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds
the ainu people have various types of marriage
a child is traditionally promised in marriage by arrangement between their parents and the parents of their betrothed or by a go between
when the betrothed reach a marriageable age they are told who their spouse is to be
there are also traditional marriages based on the mutual consent of both sexes
in some areas when a daughter reaches a marriageable age her parents allow her to live in a small room called a annexed to the southern wall of the house
the parents choose her husband from the men who visit her
the age of marriage is to years of age for men and to years of age for women who are traditionally tattooed
at these ages both sexes are regarded as adults
when a man proposes to a woman in traditional fashion he visits her house and she hands him a full bowl of rice
he then eats half of the rice and returns the rest to her
if the woman eats the remaining rice she accepts his proposal
if she does not and instead puts it beside her she rejects his proposal
when a man and woman become engaged or learn that their engagement has been arranged they exchange gifts
the man sends her a small engraved knife a workbox a spool and other gifts
she sends him embroidered clothes coverings for the back of the hand leggings and other handmade clothes
the worn out fabric of old clothing is used for baby clothes because soft cloth is good for their skin
additionally worn out material was thought to protect babies from the gods of illness and demons due to these entities abhorrence of dirty things
before a baby is breast fed they are given a decoction of the endodermis of an alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities
children are raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five
even when they wear clothes they do not wear belts and leave the front of their clothes open
subsequently they wear bark clothes without patterns such as until they come of age
ainu babies traditionally are not given permanent names when they are born

newborn babies are named and
their tentative names have a portion meaning excrement or old things to ward off the demon of ill health
some children are named based on their behavior or habits others are named after notable events or after their parents wishes for their future

the ainu are traditionally animists believing that everything in nature has a on the inside
the most important include ainu craftsmen and the ainu as a whole traditionally believed that anything made with deep sincerity was imbued with spirit and also became a
they also held the belief that ancestors and the power of the family could be invoked through certain patterns in art to protect them from malignant influences
the ainu religion has no priests by profession
instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary

they are placed on an altar used to send back the spirits of killed animals

traditional ainu belief holds that their spirits are immortal and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to
the ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice arctolatry or bear worship
the ainu believe that the bear holds particular importance as s chosen method of delivering the gift of the bears hide and meat to humans
john batchelor reported that the ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which many islands float a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west
he wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish which when it moves causes earthquakes
ainu assimilated into mainstream japanese society have adopted buddhism and shint some northern ainu were converted as members of the russian orthodox church
regarding ainu communities in shikotan and other areas that fall within the russian sphere of cultural influence there have been a few churches constructed and some ainu are reported to have accepted the christian faith
there have also been reports that the russian orthodox church has performed some missionary projects in the sakhalin ainu community
however there are only reports of a few conversions to christianity
converts have been scorned as by other members of the ainu community
reports indicate that many ainu have kept their faith in their traditional deities
according to a survey conducted by hokkaid university a high percentage of ainu are members of their household family religion which is buddhism
however it is noted that similar to the japanese religious consciousness there is not a strong feeling of identification with a particular religion with buddhist and traditional beliefs both being part of their daily lives
the ainu religion consists of a pantheistic animist structure in which the world is founded on interactions between humans and
within all living beings natural forces and objects there is a that is an extension of a greater
are gods or spirits that choose to visit the human world in temporary physical forms both animate and inanimate within the human world
once the physical vessel dies or breaks the returns to the and leaves its physical form behind as a gift to humans
if the humans treated the vessel and with respect and gratitude then the would return out of delight for the human world
due to this interaction the ainu lived with deep reverence for nature and all objects and phenomena in the hopes that the would return
the ainu believed that the granted humans objects skills and knowledge to use tools and thus deserve respect and worship
daily practices included the moderation of hunting gathering and harvesting to not disturb the
often the ainu would make offerings of an which usually consisted of whittled willow tree wood with decorative shavings still attached and wine to the
they also built sacred altars called separated from the main house and raised storehouses and often observed outdoor rituals
the ainu observed a ritual that would return a divine or spiritual being in ainu mythology to the spiritual realm
this sending ritual was called omante
a bear cub would be captured alive during hibernation and raised in the village as a child
women would care for the cubs as if they were their children sometimes even nursing them if needed
once the bears reached maturity they would hold another ritual every to years called iomante
people from neighboring villages were invited to help celebrate this ritual in which members of the village would send the bear back to the realm of spirits by gathering around it in a central area and using special ceremonial arrows to shoot it
afterwards they would eat the meat
however in this ritual was outlawed as animal cruelty
in it became exempt due to its cultural significance to the ainu
the ritual has since been modified it is now an annual festival
the festival begins at sundown with a torch parade
a play is then performed and this is followed by music and dancing
other rituals were performed for things such as food and illness
the ainu had a ritual to welcome the salmon praying for a big catch and another to thank the salmon at the end of the season
there was also a ritual for warding off that would bring epidemics using strong smelling herbs placed in doorways windows and gardens to turn away epidemic
similarly to many religions the ainu also gave prayers and offerings to their ancestors in the spirit world or afterlife
they would also pray to the fire to deliver their offerings of broken snacks and fruit as well as tobacco
traditional dances are performed at ceremonies and banquets
dancing is a part of the newly organized cultural festivals and it is even done privately in daily life
ainu traditional dances often involve large circles of dancers and sometimes there are onlookers that sing without musical instruments
in rituals these dances are intimate they involve the calls and movements of animals and or insects
some like the sword and bow dances are rituals that were used to worship and give thanks for nature
this was to thank deities that they believed were in their surroundings
there was also a dance in iomante that mimicked the movements of a living bear
however some dances are improvised and meant just for entertainment
overall ainu traditional dancing reinforced their connection to nature and the religious world and provided a link to other arctic cultures
funerals included prayers and offerings to the fire as well as verse laments expressing wishes for a smooth journey to the next world
the items that were to be buried with the dead were first broken or cracked to allow spirits to be released and travel to the afterlife together
sometimes a burial would be followed by burning the residence of the dead
in the event of an unnatural death there would be a speech raging against the gods
in the afterlife recognized ancestral spirits moved through and influenced the world though neglected spirits would return to the living world and cause misfortune
prosperity of family in the afterlife would depend on prayers and offerings left by living descendants this often led to ainu parents teaching their children to look after them in the afterlife
most hokkaid ainu and some other ainu are members of an umbrella group called the hokkaido ainu association
the organization changed its name to hokkaid utari association in due to the fact that the word ainu was often used in a derogatory manner by the non ainu ethnic japanese
it was changed back to the hokkaido ainu association in after the passing of the new law regarding the ainu
the organization was originally controlled by the government to speed ainu assimilation and integration into the japanese nation state
it is now run exclusively by ainu and operates mostly independently of the government
other key institutions include the foundation for research and promotion of ainu culture established by the japanese government after the enactment of the ainu culture law in the hokkaid university center for ainu and indigenous studies established in and various museums and cultural centers
the ainu people living in tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community
since late the ainu have developed cultural exchange and cooperation with the smi people of northern europe
both the smi and the ainu participate in the organization for arctic indigenous peoples and the smi research office in lapland
currently there are several ainu museums and cultural parks
some of them are on march the sapporo district court decided a landmark case that for the first time in japanese history recognized the right of the ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions
the case arose because of a government plan to build two dams in the saru river watershed in southern hokkaid
the dams were part of a series of development projects under the second national development plan that were intended to industrialize the north of japan
the planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor near nibutani village the home of a large community of ainu people and an important center of ainu culture and history
when the government commenced construction on the dam in the early s two ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their property
these landowners were kaizawa tadashi and kayano shigeru well known and important leaders in the ainu community
after kaizawa and kayano declined to sell their land the hokkaid development bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a project authorization which required the men to vacate their land
when their appeal of the authorization was denied kayano and kaizawas son koichi filed suit against the hokkaid development bureau
the final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the ainu people
nearly all of the plaintiffs claims were recognized
moreover the decision marked the first time japanese case law acknowledged the ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders
the decision included broad fact finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the ainu people by japans majority referred to as in the case and discussions about the case
the decision was issued on march
because of the broad implications for ainu rights the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision which became final two weeks later
after the decision was issued on may the diet passed the ainu culture law and repealed the ainu protection act the law that had been the vehicle of ainu oppression for almost one hundred yearsthe laws original japanese text is available at wikisource
while the ainu culture law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings the shift that it represents in japans view of the ainu people is a testament to the importance of the nibutani decision
in the cultural landscape along the sarugawa river resulting from ainu tradition and modern settlement was designated an important cultural landscape of japan
a later action seeking the restoration of ainu assets held in trust by the japanese government was dismissed in
there is no single government body to coordinate ainu affairs
rather various advisory boards are set up by the hokkaido government to advise on specific matters
one such committee operated in the late s and its work resulted in the
this panel was criticized for including no ainu members
in another panel was established which notably included an ainu member for the first time
it completed its work in issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the ainu
on january the was founded after a group of ainu activists in hokkaid announced the formation of a political party for the ainu on october
the ainu association of hokkaid reported that kayano shiro the son of the former ainu leader kayano shigeru would head the party
their aim is to contribute to the realization of a society where the ainu and japanese can coexist and possess equal rights in japan
the ainu act simplified procedures for obtaining various permissions from authorities in regards to the traditional lifestyle of the ainu and nurtured the identity and cultures of the ainu without defining the ethnic group by blood lineage
on july the national ainu museum was opened
it had originally been scheduled to open on april prior to the tokyo olympic and paralympic games scheduled in the same year in shiraoi hokkaid
the park was planned to be a base for the protection and promotion of ainu people culture and language
the museum promotes the culture and habits of the ainu people who are the original inhabitants of hokkaid
upopoy in the ainu language means singing in a large group
the national ainu museum building has images and videos exhibiting the history and daily life of the ainu
the ainu cultural contribution is also recognized by a unesco listing in consequence of a unesco decision to list non physical cultural assets including songs and dancing
in july it was reported that a group of ainu from hokkaido was suing the government to reclaim the right of salmon river fishing
this has been outlawed for a century except for the exemption of a limited number of salmon for ceremonial purposes
the group claimed the japanese government did not abide by the united nations declaration on the rights of indigenous people which it had signed
as a result of the treaty of saint petersburg the kuril islands along with their ainu inhabitants came under japanese administration
a total of north kuril ainu arrived in petropavlovsk kamchatsky on september after they decided to remain under russian rule
they refused the offer by russian officials to move to new reservations in the commander islands
an agreement was reached in and the ainu decided to settle in the village of yavin
in march the group left petropavlovsk and started the journey towards yavin on foot
four months later they arrived at their new homes
another village golygino was founded later
under soviet rule both villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the russian dominated zaporozhye rural settlement in ust bolsheretsky raion
as a result of intermarriage the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the kamchadal community
in k
omelchenko the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the ussr banned the press from publishing any more information on the ainu living in the ussr
this order was revoked after two decades
the north kuril ainu of zaporozhye form the largest ainu subgroup in russia
the nakamura clan the smallest group numbers just six people residing in petropavlovsk
on sakhalin island a few dozen people identify themselves as sakhalin ainu but many more with partial ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it
most of the japanese people living in russia are of mixed japanese ainu ancestry although they do not acknowledge it
similarly no one identifies themselves as amur valley ainu although people of partial descent live in khabarovsk
there is no evidence of living descendants of the kamchatka ainu
in the census of russia nearly people tried to register themselves as ethnic ainu in the village but the governing council of kamchatka krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic kamchadal
in the leader of the ainu community in kamchatka alexei vladimirovich nakamura requested that vladimir ilyukhin and boris nevzorov include the ainu in the central list of the indigenous small numbered peoples of the north siberia and the far east
this request was also denied
ethnic ainu living in sakhalin oblast and khabarovsk krai are not organized politically
according to alexei nakamura only ainu live in russia
they along with the kurile kamchadals are fighting for official recognition
since the ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in russia they are counted as people without nationality as ethnic russians or as kamchadals
the ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the kuril islands and that the japanese and russians were both invaders
in the small ainu community living in russia in kamchatka krai wrote a letter to vladimir putin urging him to reconsider any move to award the southern kuril islands to japan
in the letter they blamed the japanese the tsarist russians and the soviets for crimes against the ainu such as killings and assimilation they also urged him to recognize the japanese genocide against the ainu people
this proposal was rejected
both the kuril ainu and kuril kamchadal ethnic groups lack the fishing and hunting rights that the russian government grants to the indigenous tribal communities of the far north
in march alexei nakamura revealed that plans for an ainu village to be created in petropavlovsk kamchatsky and plans for an ainu dictionary are underway
the traditional locations of the ainu are hokkaido sakhalin the kuril islands kamchatka and the northern tohoku region
many of the place names that remain in hokkaido and the kuril islands have a phonetic equivalent of the ainu place names
in ce a kanj bugy implemented an assimilation policy for ainu engaged in fishing in the tsugaru peninsula
from that point on ainu culture rapidly disappeared from honshu
after the treaty of saint petersburg most of the ainu from the kuril islands were moved to the island of shikotan by providing the pioneers with essential life supplies and for defense purposes
in the soviet union invaded japan and occupied sakhalin and the kuril islands
the ainu who lived there were repatriated to their home country japan except for those who indicated their willingness to remain
the population of the ainu during the edo period was a maximum of it has since declined due in part to the spread of infectious diseases
it was traditionally regarded as a tenry territory
according to the russian census ainu native speakers lived in russian territory
currently there is no ainu category in the japanese national census and no fact finding has been conducted by national institutions
therefore the exact number of ainu people is unknown
however multiple surveys have been conducted that provide an indication of the total population
according to a hokkaido agency survey there were ainu people in hokkaido
when viewed by the branch office there are many in the iburi hidaka branch office
the definition of ainu by the hokkaido agency in this survey is a person who seems to have inherited the blood of ainu or the same livelihood as those with marriage or adoption
additionally if the other person is declared not to be ainu then it is not subject to investigation
a survey determined an ainu population of
another survey yielded a total of ainu living in japan
however there are no other surveys that support this high estimate
many ainu live outside of hokkaido
a survey estimated that the population of ainu living in tokyo was
according to a survey report on utari living in tokyo it is estimated that the ainu population of the tokyo area alone exceeds of ainu living in hokkaido there are more than ainu living in the tokyo metropolitan area
in addition to japan and russia it was reported in that there was a descendant of kuril ainu in poland but there are also indications that they are a descendant of the aleut
according to a survey the ainu population in hokkaido is about
this is a sharp drop from in
however this is partially due to a decrease in membership in the ainu association of hokkaido which is cooperating with the survey
additionally interest in protecting personal information has increased
it is thought that the number of individuals who cooperate is declining and that it does not match the actual population of ainu people
these are unofficial subgroups of the ainu people with location and population estimates

it is primarily associated with the greek cities of athens argos thebes corinth and rhodes
it may also be applied generically to all such citadels including rome carthage jerusalem celtic bratislava asia minor or castle rock in edinburgh
an example in ireland is the rock of cashel
in central italy many small rural communes still cluster at the base of a fortified habitation known as of the commune
other parts of the world have developed other names for the high citadel or which often have reinforced a naturally strong site
because of this many cultures have included acropolises in their societies however do not use the same name for them
the acropolis of a city was used in many ways with regards to ancient time and through references
because an acropolis was built at the highest part of a city it served as a highly functional form of protection a fortress and was as well as a home to the royal of a city and a centre for religion through the worshipping of different gods
there have been many classical and ancient acropolises including the most commonly known acropolis of athens as well as the tepecik acropolis at patara ankara acropolis acropolis of la blanca acropolis at the maya site in guatemala and the acropolis at halieis
the most famous example is the athenian acropolis which is a collection of structures featuring a citadel on the highest part of land in ancient athens greece
many notable structures at the site were constructed in the th century bce including the propylaea erechtheion and the temple of athena
the temple is also commonly known as the parthenon which is derived from the divine athena parthenos
there were often dances music and plays held at the acropolis which it served as a community centre for the city of athens
it became a prime tourist destination by the nd century ad during the roman empire and was known as the greece of greece as coined by an unknown poet
although originating in the mainland of greece use of the acropolis model quickly spread to greek colonies such as the dorian lato on crete during the archaic period
the tepecik acropolis at patara served as a harbor to nearby communities and naval forces such as antigonos i monopthalmos and demetrios poliorketes and combined land and sea
its fortification wall and bastion date back to the classical period
the acropolis was constructed in the fourth century bce by the hekatomnids that ultimately led to its seizure in bce by alexander the great
the acropolis contributed significantly to the overall development that took place during the hellenistic empires
this acropolis was the earliest place of settlement probably dating back to the third millennium bce
during excavations that took place in ceramic items terracotta figurines coins bone and stone objects were found that date to the fourth century bce
the fortification wall and bastion that are built at this acropolis uses a style of masonry commonly known as the greek word
this style of masonry was likely used for weight bearing purposes
the acropolis at halieis dates back to the neolithic and classical periods
it included a fortified wall sanctuary of apollo and necropolis
this acropolis was the highest point of fortification on the south edge at halieis
there was a small open air cult space including an altar and monuments
the ankara acropolis which was set in modern day turkey is a historically prominent space that has changed over time through the urban development of the country from the phrygian period

acropolises today have become the epicenters of tourism and attraction sites in many modern day greek cities
the athenian acropolis in particular is the most famous and has the best vantage point in athens greece
today tourists can purchase tickets to visit the athenian acropolis including walking sightseeing and bus tours as well as a classic greek dinner
because of its classical hellenistic and greco roman style the ruins of mission san juan capistranos great stone church in california united states has been called an american acropolis
the civilization developed its religious educational and cultural aspects of the acropolis and is used today as a location that holds events such as operas
the neighborhood of morningside heights in new york city is commonly referred to as the academic acropolis due to its high elevation and the concentration of educational institutions in the area including columbia university and its affiliates barnard college teachers college union theological seminary and the jewish theological seminary of america manhattan school of music bank street college of education and new york theological seminary
the analogy is also aided by the neoclassical architecture of the columbia university campus which was designed by mckim mead white in the early th century
much of the modern day uses of acropolises have been discovered through excavations that have developed over the course of many years
for example the athenian acropolis includes a great temple that holds the parthenon a specific space for ancient worship
through todays findings and research the parthenon treasury is able to be recognized as the west part of the structure as well as the parthenon itself
most excavations have been able to provide archaeologists with samples of pottery ceramics and vessels

acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a component of traditional chinese medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body
acupuncture is a pseudoscience the theories and practices of tcm are not based on scientific knowledge and it has been characterized as quackery
there is a range of acupuncture technological variants that originated in different philosophies and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed
however it can be divided into two main foundational philosophical applications and approaches the first being the modern standardized form called eight principles tcm and the second being an older system that is based on the ancient daoist wuxing better known as the five elements or phases in the west
acupuncture is most often used to attempt pain relief though acupuncturists say that it can also be used for a wide range of other conditions
acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment
the global acupuncture market was worth us billion in
the market was led by europe with a share followed by asia pacific with a share and the americas with a share
it was estimated in that the industry would reach a market size of us billion by
the conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no good evidence of benefit which suggests that it is not an effective method of healthcare
acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single use needles
when properly delivered it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects
when accidents and infections do occur they are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner particularly in the application of sterile techniques
a review conducted in stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade
the most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections
since serious adverse events continue to be reported it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk
scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional chinese concepts such as qi meridians and acupuncture points and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy or meridians which was a major part of early belief systems
acupuncture is believed to have originated around bc in china around the time the inner classic of huang di was published though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier
over time conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar celestial and earthly cycles yin and yang energies and a bodys rhythm on the effectiveness of treatment
acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in china due to changes in the countrys political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or scientific medicine
acupuncture spread first to korea in the th century ad then to japan through medical missionaries and then to europe beginning with france
in the th century as it spread to the united states and western countries spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with scientific knowledge were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points
acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine
it is used most commonly for pain relief though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions
acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment
for example the american society of anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment of nonspecific noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy
acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin
according to the mayo foundation for medical education and research a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted for the majority of cases the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes
it can be associated with the application of heat pressure or laser light
classically acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition and not on scientific research
there is also a non invasive therapy developed in early th century japan using an elaborate set of instruments other than needles for the treatment of children
clinical practice varies depending on the country
a comparison of the average number of patients treated per hour found significant differences between china and the united states
chinese herbs are often used
there is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches involving different philosophies
although various different techniques of acupuncture practice have emerged the method used in traditional chinese medicine seems to be the most widely adopted in the us
traditional acupuncture involves needle insertion moxibustion and cupping therapy and may be accompanied by other procedures such as feeling the pulse and other parts of the body and examining the tongue
traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a life force circulates within the body in lines called meridians
the main methods practiced in the uk are tcm and western medical acupuncture
the term western medical acupuncture is used to indicate an adaptation of tcm based acupuncture which focuses less on tcm
the western medical acupuncture approach involves using acupuncture after a medical diagnosis
limited research has compared the contrasting acupuncture systems used in various countries for determining different acupuncture points and thus there is no defined standard for acupuncture points
in traditional acupuncture the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used
in tcm the four diagnostic methods are inspection auscultation and olfaction inquiring and palpation
inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue including analysis of the tongue size shape tension color and coating and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge
auscultation and olfaction involve listening for particular sounds such as wheezing and observing body odor
inquiring involves focusing on the seven inquiries chills and fever perspiration appetite thirst and taste defecation and urination pain sleep and menses and leukorrhea
palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender a shi points and feeling the pulse
the most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation
acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking
needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination
reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications
in many areas only sterile single use acupuncture needles are allowed including the state of california usa
needles vary in length between with shorter needles used near the face and eyes and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues needle diameters vary from to with thicker needles used on more robust patients
thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion
the tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage although blunt needles cause more pain
apart from the usual filiform needle other needle types include three edged needles and the nine ancient needles
japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially sometimes without penetrating the skin and surrounded by a guide tube
korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand
the skin is sterilized and needles are inserted frequently with a plastic guide tube
needles may be manipulated in various ways including spinning flicking or moving up and down relative to the skin
since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin a quick insertion of the needle is recommended
often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull localized aching sensation that is called de qi as well as needle grasp a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin
acupuncture can be painful
the acupuncturists skill level may influence the painfulness of the needle insertion a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain
de qi refers to a claimed sensation of numbness distension or electrical tingling at the needling site
if these sensations are not observed then inaccurate location of the acupoint improper depth of needle insertion inadequate manual manipulation are blamed
if de qi is not immediately observed upon needle insertion various manual manipulation techniques are often applied to promote it
once de qi is observed techniques might be used which attempt to influence the de qi for example by certain manipulation the de qi can allegedly be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body
other techniques aim at tonifying or sedating qi
the former techniques are used in deficiency patterns the latter in excess patterns
de qi is more important in chinese acupuncture while western and japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment
it is difficult but not impossible to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture
due to acupunctures invasive nature one of the major challenges in efficacy research is in the design of an appropriate placebo control group
for efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects sham forms of acupuncture where the patient practitioner and analyst are blinded seem the most acceptable approach
sham acupuncture uses non penetrating needles or needling at non acupuncture points eg inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied or in places not associated with meridians
the under performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non specific effects or that the sham treatments are not inert or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment
a review in nature reviews cancer found that contrary to the claimed mechanism of redirecting the flow of qi through meridians researchers usually find that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted how often or even if needles are actually inserted
in other words sham or placebo acupuncture generally produces the same effects as real acupuncture and in some cases does better
a meta analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain was modified by the location of the needles the number of needles used the experience or technique of the practitioner or by the circumstances of the sessions
the same analysis also suggested that the number of needles and sessions is important as greater numbers improved the outcomes of acupuncture compared to non acupuncture controls
there has been little systematic investigation of which components of an acupuncture session may be important for any therapeutic effect including needle placement and depth type and intensity of stimulation and number of needles used
the research seems to suggest that needles do not need to stimulate the traditionally specified acupuncture points or penetrate the skin to attain an anticipated effect
a response to sham acupuncture in osteoarthritis may be used in the elderly but placebos have usually been regarded as deception and thus unethical
however some physicians and ethicists have suggested circumstances for applicable uses for placebos such as it might present a theoretical advantage of an inexpensive treatment without adverse reactions or interactions with drugs or other medications
as the evidence for most types of alternative medicine such as acupuncture is far from strong the use of alternative medicine in regular healthcare can present an ethical question
using the principles of evidence based medicine to research acupuncture is controversial and has produced different results
some research suggests acupuncture can alleviate pain but the majority of research suggests that acupunctures effects are mainly due to placebo
evidence suggests that any benefits of acupuncture are short lasting
there is insufficient evidence to support use of acupuncture compared to mainstream medical treatments
acupuncture is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term
the use of acupuncture has been criticized owing to there being little scientific evidence for explicit effects or the mechanisms for its supposed effectiveness for any condition that is discernible from placebo
acupuncture has been called theatrical placebo and david gorski argues that when acupuncture proponents advocate harnessing of placebo effects or work on developing meaningful placebos they essentially concede it is little more than that
publication bias is cited as a concern in the reviews of randomized controlled trials of acupuncture
a review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in china japan hong kong and taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture as were ten out of eleven studies conducted in russia
a assessment of the quality of randomized controlled trials on traditional chinese medicine including acupuncture concluded that the methodological quality of most such trials was generally poor particularly for trials published in chinese journals
the study also found that trials published in non chinese journals tended to be of higher quality
chinese authors use more chinese studies which have been demonstrated to be uniformly positive
a review of systematic reviews of acupuncture published in chinese journals found that less than half of these reviews reported testing for publication bias and that the majority of these reviews were published in journals with impact factors of zero
a study comparing pre registered records of acupuncture trials with their published results found that it was uncommon for such trials to be registered before the trial began
this study also found that selective reporting of results and changing outcome measures to obtain statistically significant results was common in this literature
scientist and journalist steven salzberg identifies acupuncture and chinese medicine generally as a focus for fake medical journals such as the journal of acupuncture and meridian studies and acupuncture in medicine
acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and sterile single use needles
when improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects
accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner
to reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently
a overview of cochrane reviews found acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions
people with serious spinal disease such as cancer or infection are not good candidates for acupuncture
contraindications to acupuncture include coagulopathy disorders warfarin use severe psychiatric disorders and skin infections or skin trauma
further electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices
a systematic review of systematic reviews found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported
between and ninety five cases of serious adverse events including five deaths were reported
many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists
this might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately trained acupuncturists
most such reports originate from asia which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained asian acupuncturists
many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries
these included australia austria canada croatia france germany ireland the netherlands new zealand spain sweden switzerland the uk and the us
the number of adverse effects reported from the uk appears particularly unusual which may indicate less under reporting in the uk than other countries
reports included cases of infections and cases of organ trauma
the most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax and bacterial and viral infections
a review found cases of infections mycobacterium was the pathogen in at least
likely sources of infection include towels hot packs or boiling tank water and reusing reprocessed needles
possible sources of infection include contaminated needles reusing personal needles a persons skin containing mycobacterium and reusing needles at various sites in the same person
although acupuncture is generally considered a safe procedure a review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade including those of mycobacterium
although it is recommended that practitioners of acupuncture use disposable needles the reuse of sterilized needles is still permitted
it is also recommended that thorough control practices for preventing infection be implemented and adapted
a systematic review of the english language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare but that acupuncture is not without risk
between and the english language literature from countries and regions reported adverse events
the majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor and the incidences were low
for example a prospective survey of acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and minor ones a rate of per interventions
another survey found there were minor adverse events of which were serious amid acupuncture patients
the most common adverse effect observed was infection and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature caused by skin contact at the needling site
infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting
other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries four brain injuries four peripheral nerve injuries five heart injuries seven other organ and tissue injuries bilateral hand edema epithelioid granuloma pseudolymphoma argyria pustules pancytopenia and scarring due to hot needle technique
adverse reactions from acupuncture which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice included syncope galactorrhoea bilateral nystagmus pyoderma gangrenosum hepatotoxicity eruptive lichen planus and spontaneous needle migration
a systematic review found cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture three causing death
two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula
the same review found vascular injuries were rare bleeding and pseudoaneurysm were most prevalent
a systematic review aiming to summarize all reported case of cardiac tamponade after acupuncture found cases resulting in deaths with little doubt about cause in most fatal instances
the same review concluded that cardiac tamponade was a serious usually fatal though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture and urged training to minimize risk
a review found that a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the uks national health service of which were not severe though miscategorization and under reporting may alter the total figures
from january to december safety incidents were recognized within the nhs organizations
the adverse events recorded included retained needles dizziness loss of consciousness unresponsive falls bruising or soreness at needle site pneumothorax and other adverse side effects
acupuncture practitioners should know and be prepared to be responsible for any substantial harm from treatments
some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe
however there is an increasing literature on adverse events
acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting anticoagulants assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth but studies are required to verify these findings
a systematic review of the chinese language literature found numerous acupuncture related adverse events including pneumothorax fainting subarachnoid hemorrhage and infection as the most frequent and cardiovascular injuries subarachnoid hemorrhage pneumothorax and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious most of which were due to improper technique
between and the chinese language literature reported adverse events
prospective surveys show that mild transient acupuncture associated adverse events ranged from to
in a study with patients the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly
another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of incidences among patients
infections mainly hepatitis after acupuncture are reported often in english language research though are rarely reported in chinese language research making it plausible that acupuncture associated infections have been underreported in china
infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles
other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma chylothorax injuries of abdominal organs and tissues injuries in the neck region injuries to the eyes including orbital hemorrhage traumatic cataract injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis peripheral motor nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction local allergic reactions to metal needles stroke and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture
a causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest pyknolepsy shock fever cough thirst aphonia leg numbness and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain
the same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks
between and the korean language literature contained reports of adverse events
between the s and the japanese language literature contained reports of adverse events
although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in china its use in pediatrics in the united states did not become common until the early s
in the national health interview survey conducted by the national center for health statistics estimated that approximately children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions
in a study determined that the use of acupuncture needle treatment on children was questionable due to the possibility of adverse side effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults
the study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants as well as on children who are over fatigued very weak or have over eaten
when used on children acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well trained licensed practitioners using sterile needles however a review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture
the same review found adverse events of them serious
the adverse events were mostly mild in nature
the prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from to an estimated incidences among patients
on rare occasions adverse events were serious many might have been a result of substandard practice
the incidence of serious adverse events was per one million which included children and adults
when used during pregnancy the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient with few serious adverse events
the most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain followed by bleeding
although two deaths were reported there was a lack of acupuncture associated maternal mortality
limiting the evidence as certain probable or possible in the causality evaluation the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was per
although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion these spots as well as the abdominal region should be avoided during pregnancy
four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising burns and cellulitis spinal epidural abscess and large superficial basal cell carcinoma
ten adverse events were associated with cupping
the minor ones were keloid scarring burns and bullae the serious ones were acquired hemophilia a stroke following cupping on the back and neck factitious panniculitis reversible cardiac hypertrophy and iron deficiency anemia
as with other alternative medicines unethical or nave practitioners may induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment
professional ethics codes set by accrediting organizations such as the national certification commission for acupuncture and oriental medicine require practitioners to make timely referrals to other health care professionals as may be appropriate
stephen barrett states that there is a risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition
acupuncture is a substantial part of traditional chinese medicine
early acupuncture beliefs relied on concepts that are common in tcm such as a life force energy called qi
qi was believed to flow from the bodys primary organs to the superficial body tissues of the skin muscles tendons bones and joints through channels called meridians
acupuncture points where needles are inserted are mainly found at locations along the meridians
acupuncture points not found along a meridian are called extraordinary points and those with no designated site are called a shi points
in tcm disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as yin yang qi xu zng f meridians and of the interaction between the body and the environment
therapy is based on which pattern of disharmony can be identified
for example some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind cold and damp
in order to determine which pattern is at hand practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue the relative strength of pulse points the smell of the breath the quality of breathing or the sound of the voice
tcm and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms
many within the scientific community consider acupuncture to be quackery and pseudoscience having no effect other than as theatrical placebo
david gorski has argued that of all forms of quackery acupuncture has perhaps gained most acceptance among physicians and institutions
academics massimo pigliucci and maarten boudry describe acupuncture as a borderlands science lying between science and pseudoscience
it is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians
human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive
scientific research has not supported the existence of qi meridians or yin and yang
a nature editorial described tcm as fraught with pseudoscience with the majority of its treatments having no logical mechanism of action
quackwatch states that tcm theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health disease and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community
tcm practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses
even if they could agree the tcm theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable tcm to offer rational care
academic discussions of acupuncture still make reference to pseudoscientific concepts such as qi and meridians despite the lack of scientific evidence
some modern practitioners support the use of acupuncture to treat pain but have abandoned the use of qi meridians yin yang and other mystical energies as an explanatory frameworks
the use of qi as an explanatory framework has been decreasing in china even as it becomes more prominent during discussions of acupuncture in the us
many acupuncturists attribute pain relief to the release of endorphins when needles penetrate but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease
some studies suggest acupuncture causes a series of events within the central nervous system and that it is possible to inhibit acupunctures analgesic effects with the opioid antagonist naloxone
mechanical deformation of the skin by acupuncture needles appears to result in the release of adenosine
the anti nociceptive effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the adenosine a receptor
a review in nature reviews cancer analyzed mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine which then triggered nearby a receptors
the review found that in those studies because acupuncture caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect
acupuncture along with moxibustion is one of the oldest practices of traditional chinese medicine
most historians believe the practice began in china though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated
academics david ramey and paul buell said the exact date acupuncture was founded depends on the extent to which dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes acupuncture
acupressure therapy was prevalent in india
once buddhism spread to china the acupressure therapy was also integrated into common medical practice in china and it came to be known as acupuncture
the major points of indian acupressure and chinese acupuncture are similar to each other
according to an article in rheumatology the first documentation of an organized system of diagnosis and treatment for acupuncture was in inner classic of huang di from about bc
gold and silver needles found in the tomb of liu sheng from around bc are believed to be the earliest archaeological evidence of acupuncture though it is unclear if that was their purpose
according to plinio prioreschi the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the shiji written by a historian around bc
it is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time
the year old mummified body of tzi the iceman was found with groups of tattoos many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems
evidence from the body suggests tzi had these conditions
this has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practised elsewhere in eurasia during the early bronze age however the oxford handbook of the history of medicine calls this theory speculative
it is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practised before bc
acupuncture may have been practised during the neolithic era near the end of the stone age using sharpened stones called bian shi
many chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called plen which means stone probe that may have been used for acupuncture purposes
the ancient chinese medical text huangdi neijing indicates that sharp stones were believed at the time to cure illnesses at or near the bodys surface perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate
however it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes such as puncturing a growth to drain its pus
the mawangdui texts which are believed to be from the nd century bc mention the use of pointed stones to open abscesses and moxibustion but not for acupuncture
it is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting due to the ancient chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released
it is likely bloodletting was an antecedent to acupuncture
according to historians lu gwei djen and joseph needham there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around bc
some hieroglyphs and pictographs from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practised
however historians lu and needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in china during this time period
it is possible that bronze was used for early acupuncture needles
tin copper gold and silver are also possibilities though they are considered less likely or to have been used in fewer cases
if acupuncture was practised during the shang dynasty organic materials like thorns sharpened bones or bamboo may have been used
once methods for producing steel were discovered it would replace all other materials since it could be used to create a very fine but sturdy needle
lu and needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archaeological evidence such as sharpened bones bamboo or stones were also used for other purposes
an article in rheumatology said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of mawangdui from bc suggest that acupuncture was not practised by that time
several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture
this may have been the result of competing schools of thought
some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding while others mixed the ideas of blood letting and spiritual chi energy
over time the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body and eventually to balancing yin and yang energies as well
according to david ramey no single method or theory was ever predominantly adopted as the standard
at the time scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed especially because in china dissection of the deceased was forbidden preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge
it is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced but the autobiography of bian que from around bc references inserting needles at designated areas
bian que believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of ones skull that he called the point of the hundred meetings
texts dated to be from to bc document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs
ramey and buell said the practice and theoretical underpinnings of modern acupuncture were introduced in the yellow emperors classic around bc
it introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy in a network of meridian in the body
the network concept was made up of acu tracts such as a line down the arms where it said acupoints were located
some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the yellow emperors classic
numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints
by the th century ad most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified
in the first half of the st century ad acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupunctures effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night the lunar cycle and the season
the science of the yin yang cycles was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly and earthly forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon
there were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times
according to needham and lu these arbitrary predictions were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology
acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection
infection is caused by a lack of sterilization but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle or needling in the wrong place or at the wrong time
later many needles were heated in boiling water or in a flame
sometimes needles were used while they were still hot creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site
nine needles were recommended in the great compendium of acupuncture and moxibustion from which may have been because of an ancient chinese belief that nine was a magic number
other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective
in some cases a lack of balance between yin and yang were believed to be the cause of disease
in the st century ad many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge
the zhen jiu jia yi jing which was published in the mid rd century became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era
other books like the yu gui zhen jing written by the director of medical services for china were also influential during this period but were not preserved
in the mid th century sun simiao published acupuncture related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules
acupuncture became more established in china as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books
the imperial medical service and the imperial medical college which both supported acupuncture became more established and created medical colleges in every province
the public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists
by time the great compendium of acupuncture and moxibustion was published during the ming dynasty most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established
by the end of the song dynasty acupuncture had lost much of its status in china
it became rarer in the following centuries and was associated with less prestigious professions like alchemy shamanism midwifery and moxibustion
additionally by the th century scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs
by a book documenting the history of chinese medicine called acupuncture a lost art
its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications as well as its association with the lower classes
in the chinese emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the imperial medical institute
he said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen scholars
in china acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower class illiterate practitioners
it was restored for a time but banned again in in favor of science based medicine
although acupuncture declined in china during this time period it was also growing in popularity in other countries
korea is believed to be the first country in asia that acupuncture spread to outside of china
within korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor dangun though it is more likely to have been brought into korea from a chinese colonial prefecture in ad
acupuncture use was commonplace in korea by the th century
it spread to vietnam in the th and th centuries
as vietnam began trading with japan and china around the th century it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well
china and korea sent medical missionaries that spread traditional chinese medicine to japan starting around ad
in several korean and chinese citizens were appointed to re organize medical education in japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system
japan later sent students back to china and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the chinese state medical administration system
acupuncture began to spread to europe in the second half of the th century
around this time the surgeon general of the dutch east india company met japanese and chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged europeans to further investigate it
he published the first in depth description of acupuncture for the european audience and created the term acupuncture in his work de acupunctura
france was an early adopter among the west due to the influence of jesuit missionaries who brought the practice to french clinics in the th century
the french doctor louis berlioz is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in europe in before publishing his findings in
by the th century acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world
americans and britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early th century although interest waned by mid century
western practitioners abandoned acupunctures traditional beliefs in spiritual energy pulse diagnosis and the cycles of the moon sun or the bodys rhythm
diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy for example conflicted with the wests own anatomical diagrams
it adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves
in europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body as electrical pulses were found to make a frogs leg twitch after death
the west eventually created a belief system based on travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain
they were in the same locations as chinas spiritually identified acupuncture points but under a different nomenclature
the first elaborate western treatise on acupuncture was published in by willem ten rhijne
in china the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in when mao zedong took power and sought to unite china behind traditional cultural values
it was also during this time that many eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional chinese medicine
new practices were adopted in the th century such as using a cluster of needles electrified needles or leaving needles inserted for up to a week
a lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear
acupuncture research organizations such as the international society of acupuncture were founded in the s and s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals
china where acupuncture was believed to have originated was increasingly influenced by western medicine
meanwhile acupuncture grew in popularity in the us
the us congress created the office of alternative medicine in and the national institutes of health declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in november
in the national center for complementary and alternative medicine was created within the nih
acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the us
politicians from the chinese communist party said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the partys commitment to science
communist party chairman mao zedong later reversed this position arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles
in new york times reporter james reston published an article on his acupuncture experiences in china which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture
the us president richard nixon visited china in
during one part of the visit the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than anesthesia
later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high pain tolerance and received heavy indoctrination before the operation these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving morphine surreptitiously through an intravenous drip that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients
one patient receiving open heart surgery while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a local anesthetic into the wound
after the national institute of health expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions adoption in the us grew further
in the first legal acupuncture center in the us was established in washington dc and in the american internal revenue service allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense
in a bbc documentary alternative medicine filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture induced anesthesia
it was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of anesthetics
in unesco inscribed acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional chinese medicine on the unesco intangible cultural heritage list following chinas nomination
acupuncture is most heavily practiced in china and is popular in the us australia and europe
in switzerland acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since
in the united kingdom a total of million acupuncture treatments were administered in
acupuncture is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the uk
an estimated in adults in australia used acupuncture in
in japan it is estimated that percent of the population will try acupuncture at some point though in most cases it is not covered by public health insurance
users of acupuncture in japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education
approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future while did not
less than one percent of the us population reported having used acupuncture in the early s
by the early s more than million americans reported having used acupuncture as part of their health care
in the us acupuncture is increasingly used at academic medical centers and is usually offered through cam centers or anesthesia and pain management services
examples include those at harvard university stanford university johns hopkins university and ucla
cdc clinical practice guidelines from list acupuncture among the types of complementary and alternative medicines physicians should consider in preference to opioid prescription for certain kinds of pain
the use of acupuncture in germany increased by in after the german acupuncture trials supported its efficacy for certain uses
in there were more than one million users and insurance companies have estimated that two thirds of german users are women
as a result of the trials german public health insurers began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee but not tension headache or migraine
this decision was based in part on socio political reasons
some insurers in germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials
for other conditions insurers in germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments
highlighting the results of the placebo group researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient
there are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the united kingdom the united states saudi arabia australia new zealand japan canada and in european countries and elsewhere
the world health organization recommends that before being licensed or certified an acupuncturist receive hours of specialized training if they are a physician and hours for non physicians many governments have adopted similar standards
in hong kong the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the chinese medicine council that was formed in by the legislative council
it includes a licensing exam and registration as well as degree courses approved by the board
canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of british columbia ontario alberta and quebec standards set by the chinese medicine and acupuncture association of canada are used in provinces without government regulation
regulation in the us began in the s in california which was eventually followed by every state but wyoming and idaho
licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state
the needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the us by the food and drug administration
in some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners while in others by the board of licensing health or education
in japan acupuncturists are licensed by the minister of health labour and welfare after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university
in australia the chinese medicine board of australia regulates acupuncture among other chinese medical traditions and restricts the use of titles like acupuncturist to registered practitioners only
the practice of acupuncture in new zealand in acupuncture was included into the governmental accident compensation corporation act
this inclusion granted qualified and professionally registered acupuncturists to provide subsidised care and treatment to citizens residents and temporary visitors for work or sports related injuries that occurred within the country of new zealand
the two bodies for the regulation of acupuncture and attainment of acc treatment provider status in new zealand are acupuncture nz and the new zealand acupuncture standards authority
at least countries in europe have professional associations for acupuncturists
in france the acadmie nationale de mdecine has regulated acupuncture since
vipera berus the common european adder is a snake found in europe and northern asia
in greco roman mythology aeneas was a trojan hero the son of the trojan prince anchises and the greek goddess aphrodite
his father was a first cousin of king priam of troy making aeneas a second cousin to priams children
he is a minor character in greek mythology and is mentioned in homers iliad
aeneas receives full treatment in roman mythology most extensively in virgils aeneid where he is cast as an ancestor of romulus and remus
he became the first true hero of rome
snorri sturluson identifies him with the norse god varr of the sir
aeneas is the romanization of the heros original greek name
aineas is first introduced in the homeric hymn to aphrodite when aphrodite gives him his name from the adjective terrible for the terrible grief he has caused her by being born a mortal who will age and die
it is a popular etymology for the name apparently exploited by homer in the iliad
later in the medieval period there were writers who held that because the aeneid was written by a philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically
as such in the natural order the meaning of aeneas name combines greek with which becomes or in dweller ie as a god inhabiting a mortal body
however there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name
in imitation of the iliad virgil borrows epithets of homer including anchisiades magnanimum magnus heros and bonus
though he borrows many virgil gives aeneas two epithets of his own in the aeneid pater and pius
the epithets applied by virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of homer for whilst odysseus is aeneas is described as which conveys a strong moral tone
the purpose of these epithets seems to enforce the notion of aeneas divine hand as father and founder of the roman race and their use seems circumstantial when aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission
likewise aeneas is called pater when acting in the interest of his men
the story of the birth of aeneas is told in the homeric hymn to aphrodite one of the major homeric hymns
aphrodite has caused zeus the king of the gods to fall in love with mortal women
in retaliation zeus decided to put a desire over her heart for the mortal prince anchises who is tending his cattle among the hills near mount ida
when aphrodite saw him she was immediately smitten
she adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him
he is overcome by her beauty believing that she is a goddess but aphrodite identifies herself as a phrygian princess
after they make love aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison
aphrodite assures him that he will be protected and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called aeneas
however she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess
when aeneas is born aphrodite takes him to the nymphs of mount ida instructing them to raise the child to age five then take him to anchises
according to other sources anchises later brags about his encounter with aphrodite and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by zeus
thereafter he is lame in that foot so that aeneas has to carry him from the flames of troy
aeneas is a minor character in the iliad where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as yet unknown destiny but is an honorable warrior in his own right
having held back from the fighting aggrieved with priam because in spite of his brave deeds he was not given his due share of honor he leads an attack against idomeneus to recover the body of his brother in law alcathous at the urging of deiphobus
he is the leader of the trojans dardanian allies as well as a second cousin and principal lieutenant of hector son and heir of the trojan king priam
aeneass mother aphrodite frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield and he is a favorite of the sun god apollo
aphrodite and apollo would frequently rescue aeneas from combat with diomedes of argos who nearly kills him and carry him away to pergamos for healing
even the sea god poseidon who usually favors the greeks comes to aeneass rescue after he falls under the assault of achilles noting that aeneas though from a junior branch of the royal family is destined to become king of the trojan people
bruce louden presents aeneas as type the sole virtuous individual spared from general destruction following the mytheme of utnapishtim baucis and philemon noah and lot
pseudo apollodorus in his bibliotheca explains that
the greeks him alone on account of his piety
the roman mythographer gaius julius hyginus in his fabulae credits aeneas with killing enemies in the trojan war
aeneas also appears in the trojan narratives attributed to dares phrygius and dictys of crete
the history of aeneas was continued by roman authors
one influential source was the account of romes founding in cato the elders origines
the aeneas legend was well known in virgils day and appeared in various historical works including the roman antiquities of the greek historian dionysius of halicarnassus ab urbe condita by livy and gnaeus pompeius trogus
the aeneid which is books of the legendary foundation of lavinium which explains that aeneas is one of the few trojans who were not killed or enslaved when troy fell
aeneas after being commanded by the gods to flee gathered a group collectively known as the aeneads who then traveled to italy and became progenitors of the romans
the aeneads included aeneass trumpeter misenus his father anchises his friends achates sergestus and acmon the healer iapyx the helmsman palinurus and his son ascanius
he carried with him the lares and penates the statues of the household gods of troy and transplanted them to italy
several attempts to find a new home failed one such stop was on sicily where in drepanum on the islands western coast his father anchises died peacefully
after a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at junos request aeneas and his fleet made landfall at carthage after six years of wanderings
aeneas had a year long affair with the carthaginian queen dido who proposed that the trojans settle in her land and that she and aeneas reign jointly over their peoples
a marriage of sorts was arranged between dido and aeneas at the instigation of juno who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the trojans descendants
aeneass mother venus realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come
however the messenger god mercury was sent by jupiter and venus to remind aeneas of his journey and his purpose compelling him to leave secretly
when dido learned of this she uttered a curse that would forever pit carthage against rome an enmity that would culminate in the punic wars
she then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave aeneas when they first met
after the sojourn in carthage the trojans returned to sicily where aeneas organized funeral games to honor his father who had died a year before
the company traveled on and landed on the western coast of italy
aeneas descended into the underworld where he met dido and his father who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of rome
latinus king of the latins welcomed aeneass army of exiled trojans and let them reorganize their lives in latium
his daughter lavinia had been promised to turnus king of the rutuli but latinus received a prophecy that lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land namely aeneas
latinus heeded the prophecy and turnus consequently declared war on aeneas at the urging of juno who was aligned with king mezentius of the etruscans and queen amata of the latins
aeneass forces prevailed
turnus was killed and virgils account ends abruptly
the rest of aeneass biography is gleaned from other ancient sources including livy and ovids metamorphoses
according to livy aeneas was victorious but latinus died in the war
aeneas founded the city of lavinium named after his wife
he later welcomed didos sister anna perenna who then committed suicide after learning of lavinias jealousy
after aeneass death venus asked jupiter to make her son immortal
jupiter agreed
the river god numicus cleansed aeneas of all his mortal parts and venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar making him a god
aeneas was recognized as the god jupiter indiges
its also been stated that prince aeneas is the ancestor to the founders of rome the twin brothers romulus and remus the two orphan boys who are seen suckling from a she wolf
the english once widely claimed as history an original peopling of their island prior to the event a land only of fantastical giants by descendants of aeneas though even in the time of the renaissance a non english audience as well as at least one english writer found details of the stories less than convincing
the island known later as great britain was also previously known as alba a similarity of name supporting a connection with the city of alba longa a pre roman city in central italy said to have been built by ascanius son of aeneas and third ruler of the latins after latinus being either his grandson or step grandson
even if one ignores obviously far fetched elements of this foundation myth of britain johannes rastell writing in questioned along these lines supposing the original brits were descendants of a line of latin kings brute the son of silvius son of ascanius son of aeneas who came to the italian peninsula from troy then why should such a fact have escaped record in the writings of julius caesar when that roman military supreme commander had personally surveyed the lands there he had conquered for rome by bc and indeed why should the son brutus have escaped from latin histories altogether given that they did deal with silvius and ascanius and all theyre childera what became of them how they endyd that succeeded them as kyngis other details rastell found were able to be discounted without resort to factual records or with only very few facts needed other than everyday experience
were the early inhabitants of britain giants descended from the devil in union with daughters of a king dioclisian of syria to rastell if the devil had power to sow such seeds at the earlier time then why not in his own time where were the giants today other fanciful elements he deduced from intuitive psychological insights for example the greatly diminished chance of daughters married to kings on a single day and all cooperating to kill those husbands in a single night or in combination with analysis of logistical realities such as the suggested voyage of all murderous widows to britain without dispersion or diversion over three thousand miles
rastell was further able to discount the likelihood of any factuality to that ancient tale due to his failure to discover after diligent research any authentic record of its origin or explanation as to why such record should be absent
snorri sturlason in the prologue of the prose edda tells of the world as parted in three continents africa asia and the third part called europe or enea
snorri also tells of a trojan named munon who marries the daughter of the high king priam called troan and travels to distant lands marries the sybil and got a son tror who as snorri tells is identical to thor
this tale resembles some episodes of the aeneid
continuations of trojan matter in the middle ages had their effects on the character of aeneas as well
the th century french roman denas addresses aeneass sexuality
though virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto nisus and euryalus making his aeneas a purely heterosexual character in the middle ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in aeneas
the roman denas addresses that charge when queen amata opposes aeneass marrying lavinia
medieval interpretations of aeneas were greatly influenced by both virgil and other latin sources
specifically the accounts by dares and dictys which were reworked by the th century italian writer guido delle colonne colored many later readings
from guido for instance the pearl poet and other english writers get the suggestion that aeneass safe departure from troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason for which he was chastised by hecuba
in sir gawain and the green knight the pearl poet like many other english writers employed aeneas to establish a genealogy for the foundation of britain and explains that aeneas was impeached for his perfidy proven most true
aeneas had an extensive family tree
his wet nurse was caieta and he is the father of ascanius with creusa and of silvius with lavinia
ascanius also known as iulus founded alba longa and was the first in a long series of kings
according to the mythology used by virgil in the aeneid romulus and remus were both descendants of aeneas through their mother rhea silvia making aeneas the progenitor of the roman people
some early sources call him their father or grandfather but once the dates of the fall of troy and the founding of rome became accepted authors added generations between them
the julian family of rome most notably julius csar and augustus traced their lineage to ascanius and aeneas thus to the goddess venus
through the julians the palemonids make this claim
the legendary kings of britain including king arthur trace their family through a grandson of aeneas brutus
aeneass consistent epithet in virgil and other latin authors is pius a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness
there is significant scholarly debate however over the degree to which this epithet is genuine within the poem and to what extent its deployment by virgil is sarcastic
in the aeneid aeneas is described as strong and handsome but neither his hair colour nor complexion are described
in late antiquity however sources add further physical descriptions
the de excidio troiae of dares phrygius describes aeneas as auburn haired stocky eloquent courteous prudent pious and charming
his eyes were black and twinkling
there is also a brief physical description found in the th century john malalas chronographia aeneas short fat with a good chest powerful with a ruddy complexion a broad face a good nose fair skin bald on the forehead a good beard grey eyes
aeneas appears as a character in william shakespeares play troilus and cressida set during the trojan war
aeneas and dido are the main characters of a th century broadside ballad called the wandering prince of troy
the ballad ultimately alters aeneass fate from traveling on years after didos death to joining her as a spirit soon after her suicide
in modern literature aeneas is the speaker in two poems by allen tate aeneas at washington and aeneas at new york
he is a main character in ursula k
le guins lavinia a re telling of the last six books of the aeneid told from the point of view of lavinia daughter of king latinus of latium
aeneas appears in david gemmells troy series as a main heroic character who goes by the name helikaon
in rick riordans book series the heroes of olympus aeneas is regarded as the first roman demigod son of venus rather than aphrodite
will adams novel city of the lost assumes that much of the information provided by virgil is mistaken and that the true aeneas and dido did not meet and love in carthage but in a phoenician colony at cyprus on the site of the modern famagusta
their tale is interspersed with that of modern activists who while striving to stop an ambitious turkish army general trying to stage a coup accidentally discover the hidden ruins of didos palace
aeneas is a title character in henry purcells opera dido and aeneas and jakob grebers and one of the principal roles in hector berlioz opera les troyens as well as in metastasios immensely popular opera libretto didone abbandonata
canadian composer james rolfe composed his opera aeneas and dido as a companion piece to purcells opera
despite its many dramatic elements aeneass story has generated little interest from the film industry
ronald lewis portrayed aeneas in helen of troy directed by robert wise as a supporting character who is a member of the trojan royal family and a close and loyal friend to paris and escapes at the end of the film
portrayed by steve reeves he was the main character in the sword and sandal film guerra di troia
reeves reprised the role the following year in the film the avenger about aeneass arrival in latium and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow trojan refugees there
giulio brogi portrayed as aeneas in the italian tv miniseries series called eneide which gives the whole story of the aeneid from aeneas escape from to troy to his meeting of dido his arrival in italy and his duel with turnus
the most recent cinematic portrayal of aeneas was in the film troy in which he appears as a youth charged by paris to protect the trojan refugees and to continue the ideals of the city and its people
paris gives aeneas priams sword in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of troy and lay the foundations of roman culture
in this film he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war
in the role playing game by white wolf game studios aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the ventrue clan
in the action game aeneas is a playable character
the game ends with him and the aeneans fleeing troys destruction and spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed goes to a new country where he will start an empire greater than greece and troy combined that shall rule the world for years never to be outdone in the tale of men
in the tv miniseries aeneas is portrayed by alfred enoch
he also featured as an epic fighter of the dardania faction in the in
scenes depicting aeneas especially from the aeneid have been the focus of study for centuries
they have been the frequent subject of art and literature since their debut in the st century
the artist giovanni battista tiepolo was commissioned by gaetano valmarana in to fresco several rooms in the villa valmarana the family villa situated outside vicenza
tiepolo decorated the palazzina with scenes from epics such as homers iliad and virgils aeneid
amaranthus is a cosmopolitan group of more than species which make up the genus of annual or short lived perennial plants collectively known as amaranths
some of the more well known names include prostrate pigweed and love lies bleeding
some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables pseudocereals and ornamental plants
catkin like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or fall
amaranth varies in flower leaf and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from tall with a cylindrical succulent fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature
there are approximately species in the genus of which are dioecious and native to north america with the remaining monoecious species endemic to every continent from tropical lowlands to the himalayas
members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus celosia
amaranth grain is collected from the genus
the leaves of some species are also eaten
amaranthus comes from the name of this plant in ancient greek amaranth immortal noun formed from the privative prefix without and the verb to consume to exhaust indeed the amaranth has a reputation for not withering with in particular its calice which remains persistent and for this reason represents a symbol of immortality
some species are used in dry bouquets
the form amaranthus comes from an erroneous association with the greek etymon anthos meaning flower found in the name of many plants
its denominations in the languages of the peoples cultivating it since ancient times in america are huauhtli in nahuatl kiwicha atao in quechua tez o xtes in maya ahparie in purpecha wave in huichol or guegui in tarahumara
amaranth is a herbaceous plant or shrub that is either annual or perennial across the genus
flowers vary interspecifically from the presence of or tepals and stamens whereas a porate pollen grain structure remains consistent across the family
species across the genus contain concentric rings of vascular bundles and fix carbon efficiently with a c photosynthetic pathway
leaves are approximately and of oval or elliptical shape that are either opposite or alternate across species although most leaves are whole and simple with entire margins
amaranth has a primary root with deeper spreading secondary fibrous root structures
inflorescences are in the form a large panicle that varies from terminal to axial color and sex
the tassel of fluorescence is either erect or bent and varies in width and length between species
flowers are radially symmetric and either bisexual or unisexual with very small bristly perianth and pointy bracts
species in this genus are either monecious or dioecious
fruits are in the form of capsules referred to as a unilocular pixdio that opens at maturity
the top of the unilocular pixdio releases the urn that contains the seed
seeds are circular form from to millimeters in diameter and range in color with a shiny smooth seed coat
the panicle is harvested days after cultivation with approximately to seeds harvested per gram
amaranth grain contains phytochemicals that are not defined as nutrients and may be antinutrient factors such as polyphenols saponins tannins and oxalates
these compounds are reduced in content and antinutrient effect by cooking
amaranthus shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species
amaranthus is part of the amaranthaceae that is part of the larger grouping of the carophyllales
although the family is distinctive the genus has few distinguishing characters among the species present across six continents
this complicates taxonomy and amaranthus has generally been considered among systematists as a difficult genus and to hybridize often
in sauer classified the genus into two subgenera differentiating only between monoecious and dioecious species acnida aellen ex kr robertson and amaranthus
although this classification was widely accepted further infrageneric classification was needed to differentiate this widely diverse group
mosyakin and robertson later divided into three subgenera acnida amaranthus and albersia
the support for the addition of the subdivision albersia because of its indehiscent fruits coupled with three elliptic to linear tepals to be exclusive characters to members of this subgenus
the classification of these groups are further supported with a combination of floral characters reproductive strategies geographic distribution and molecular evidence
the phylogenies of amaranthus using maximum parsimony and bayesian analysis of nuclear and chloroplast genes suggest five clades within the genus diecious pumilus hybris galapagos eurasian south african australian esa south american
amaranthus includes three recognised subgenera and species although species numbers are questionable due to hybridisation and species concepts
infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence flower characters and whether a species is monoecious dioecious as in the sauer suggested classification
bracteole morphology present on the stem is used for taxonomic classification of amaranth
wild species have longer bracteoles compared to cultivated species
a modified infrageneric classification of amaranthus includes three subgenera acnida amaranthus and albersia with the taxonomy further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera
there is near certainty that a
hypochondriacus is the common ancestor to the cultivated grain species however the later series of domestication to follow remains unclear
there has been opposing hypotheses of a single as opposed to multiple domestication events of the three grain species
there is evidence of phylogenetic and geographical support for clear groupings that indicate separate domestication events in south america and central america
hybridus may derive from south america whereas a
caudatus a
hypochondriacus and a
quentiensis are native to central and north america
amaranth derives from greek unfading with the greek word for flower factoring into the words development as amaranth the unfading flower
amarant is an archaic variant
the name was first applied to the related celosia as amaranthus plants were not yet known in europe
amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination rapid growth and high rates of seed production and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid s
this is partially due to the reduction in tillage reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often
the following species of amaranthus are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the us and canada a
albus a
blitoides a
hybridus a
palmeri a
powellii a
retroflexus a
spinosus a
tuberculatus and a
a new herbicide resistant strain of a
palmeri has appeared it is glyphosate resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical
also this plant can survive in tough conditions
the species amaranthus palmeri causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and has the potential to reduce yields by in field experiments
palmer amaranth is among the top five most troublesome weeds in the southeast of the united states and has already evolved resistances to dinitroaniline herbicides and acetolactate synthase inhibitors
this makes the proper identification of amaranthus species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists
proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions
an evolutionary lineage of around species within the genus has acquired the carbon fixation pathway which increases their photosynthetic efficiency
this probably occurred in the miocene
all parts of the plant are considered edible though some may have sharp spines that need to be removed before consumption
amaranth is high in oxalates but this may be partially offset by its high calcium content
uncooked amaranth grain by weight is water carbohydrates protein and fat
a reference serving of uncooked amaranth grain provides of food energy and is a rich source of protein dietary fiber pantothenic acid vitamin b folate and several dietary minerals
uncooked amaranth is particularly rich in manganese phosphorus magnesium iron and selenium
amaranth has a high oxalate content
cooking decreases its nutritional value substantially across all nutrients with only dietary minerals remaining at moderate levels
cooked amaranth leaves are a rich source of vitamin a vitamin c calcium and manganese with moderate levels of folate iron magnesium and potassium
amaranth does not contain gluten
the native range of the genus is cosmopolitan
in pre hispanic times amaranth was cultivated by the aztec and their tributary communities in a quantity very similar to maize
known to the aztecs as amaranth is thought to have represented up to of their energy consumption before the spanish conquest
another important use of amaranth throughout mesoamerica was in ritual drinks and foods
to this day amaranth grains are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey molasses or chocolate to make a treat called meaning joy in spanish
while all species are believed to be native to the americas several have been cultivated and introduced to warm regions worldwide
amaranths cosmopolitan distribution makes it one of many plants providing evidence of pre columbian oceanic contact
the earliest archeological evidence for amaranth in the old world was found in an excavation in narhan india dated to bce
because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture its palatability ease of cooking and a protein that is particularly well suited to human nutritional needs interest in amaranth seeds revived in the s
it was recovered in mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated
it is a popular snack in mexico sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice and its use has spread to europe and other parts of north america
several species are raised for amaranth grain in asia and the americas
amaranth and its relative quinoa are considered pseudocereals because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking
the spread of amaranthus is of a joint effort of human expansion adaptation and fertilization strategies
grain amaranth has been used for food by humans in several ways
the grain can be ground into a flour for use like other grain flours
it can be popped like popcorn or flaked like oatmeal
seeds of amaranth grain have been found in antofagasta de la sierra department catamarca argentina in the southern puna desert of the north of argentina dating from years ago with evidence suggesting earlier use
archeological evidence of seeds from a
hypochondriacus and a
cruentus found in a cave in tehuacn mexico suggests amaranth was part of aztec civilization in the s
ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species amaranthus caudatus a
cruentus and a
evidence from single nucleotide polymorphisms and chromosome structure supports a
hypochondriacus as the common ancestor of the three grain species
in the united states the amaranth crop is mostly used for seed production
most amaranth in american food products starts as a ground flour blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals crackers cookies bread or other baked products
despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above without affecting functional properties or taste most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as amaranth products
amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a leaf vegetable in many parts of the world
four species of amaranthus are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern asia amaranthus cruentus amaranthus blitum amaranthus dubius and amaranthus tricolor
in indonesia and malaysia leaf amaranth is called

in the caribbean the leaves are called bhaji in trinidad and callaloo in jamaica and are sauted with onions garlic and tomatoes or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup
making up about of the total fatty acids of amaranth squalene is extracted as a vegetable based alternative to the more expensive shark oil for use in dietary supplements and cosmetics
the flowers of the hopi red dye amaranth were used by the hopi as the source of a deep red dye
also a synthetic dye was named amaranth for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth pigments known as betalains
this synthetic dye is also known as red no
in north america and e in the european union
the genus also contains several well known ornamental plants such as amaranthus caudatus a vigorous hardy annual with dark purplish flowers crowded in handsome drooping spikes
another indian annual a
hypochondriacus has deeply veined lance shaped leaves purple on the under face and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes
amaranths are recorded as food plants for some lepidoptera species including the nutmeg moth and various case bearer moths of the genus coleophora c

diego durn described the festivities for the aztec god
the aztec month of was dedicated to
people decorated their homes and trees with paper flags ritual races processions dances songs prayers and finally human sacrifices were held
this was one of the more important aztec festivals and the people prepared for the whole month
they fasted or ate very little a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey and at the end of the month it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god
after the spanish conquest cultivation of amaranth was outlawed while some of the festivities were subsumed into the christmas celebration
amaranth is associated with longevity and poetically with death and immortality
amaranth garlands were used in the mourning of achilles
john miltons paradise lost portrays a showy amaranth in the garden of eden removd from heavn when it blossoms because the flowers shade the fountain of life
he describes amaranth as immortal in reference to the flowers that generally do not wither and retain bright reddish tones of color even when deceased referred to in one species as love lies bleeding
agapanthus africanus or the african lily is a flowering plant from the genus agapanthus found only on rocky sandstone slopes of the winter rainfall fynbos from the cape peninsula to swellendam
it is also known as the lily of the nile in spite of only occurring in south africa
the plant is a rhizomatous evergreen geophyte from in height
the leathery leaves are suberect and long and strap shaped
flowers are broadly funnel shaped pale to deep blue and thick textured with a dark blue stripe running down the center of each petal
paler flowers are more common in agapanthus africanus walshii while agapanthus africanus africanus flowers tend to be darker
the flowers grow in large clusters with each flower being long
this species flowers from november to april particularly after fire
peak flowering occurs from december to february
pollination is by wind bees and sunbirds and seed dispersal by the wind
chacma baboons and buck sometimes eat the flower heads just as the first flowers begin to open
these plants are adapted to survive fire in the fynbos and resprout from thick fleshy roots after fire has passed through the area
unlike the more common agapanthus praecox this species is less suitable as a garden plant as it is far more difficult to grow
africanus subsp
africanus may be grown in rockeries in a well drained slightly acid sandy mix
they seem to be best when grown in shallow pots and will flower regularly if fed with a slow release fertiliser
africanus subsp
walshii is by far the most difficult agapanthus to grow
it can only be grown as a container plant and will not survive if planted out
they require a very well drained sandy acid mix with minimal watering in summer
both subspecies require hot dry summers and winter rainfall climate
it will not tolerate extended freezing temperatures
the name a
africanus has long been misapplied to a
praecox in horticultural use and publications across the world and horticultural plants sold as a
africanus are actually hybrids or cultivars of a
extracts of a
africanus have been shown to have antifungal properties
application of these extracts to the seeds of other plant species including economically important species has shown that it significantly reduces the severity of the impacts of certain pathogens
in the case of sorghum this application was even found to perform better than thiram a commonly used fungicide when exposed to sporisorium sorghi and s
similarly it has found to induce resistance to rust leaf in wheat through increasing the activity of pathogenesis related proteins
while the species as a whole has not yet been assessed a
africanus subsp
walshii is considered to be endangered by the south african national biodiversity institute
it is known only from a small area in the elgin valley and the population continues to decline
the largest subpopulation is threatened by unregulated informal settlement expansion
a proportion of the population is protected within the kogelberg biosphere reserve and is not threatened
in greek mythology agamemnon was a king of mycenae who commanded the achaeans during the trojan war
he was the son of king atreus and queen aerope the brother of menelaus the husband of clytemnestra and the father of iphigenia iphianassa electra laodike orestes and chrysothemis
legends make him the king of mycenae or argos thought to be different names for the same area
agamemnon was killed upon his return from troy by clytemnestra or in an older version of the story by clytemnestras lover aegisthus
his name in greek means very steadfast unbowed or resolute
the word comes from from very much and think on
in the account of dares the phrygian agamemnon was described as
blond large and powerful
he was eloquent wise and noble a man richly endowed
agamemnon was a descendant of pelops son of tantalus
according to the common story agamemnon and his younger brother menelaus were the sons of atreus king of mycenae and aerope daughter of the cretan king catreus
however according to another tradition agamemnon and menelaus were the sons of atreus son pleisthenes with their mother being aerope cleolla or eriphyle
in this tradition pleisthenes dies young with agamemnon and menelaus being raised by atreus
agamemnon had a sister anaxibia who married strophius the son of crisus
s father atreus murdered the sons of his twin brother thyestes and fed them to thyestes after discovering thyestes adultery with his wife aerope
thyestes fathered aegisthus with his own daughter pelopia and this son vowed gruesome revenge on atreus children
aegisthus murdered atreus restored thyestes to the throne and took possession of the throne of mycenae and jointly ruled with his father
during this period agamemnon and his brother menelaus took refuge with tyndareus king of sparta
in sparta agamemnon and menelaus respectively married tyndareus daughters clytemnestra and helen
in some stories clytemnestra was already married to tantalus and agamemnon murders him and the couples infant son before marrying clytemnestra
agamemnon and clytemnestra had four children one son orestes and three daughters iphigenia electra and chrysothemis
menelaus succeeded tyndareus in sparta while agamemnon with his brothers assistance drove out aegisthus and thyestes to recover his fathers kingdom
he extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in greece
agamemnons family history had been tarnished by murder incest and treachery consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor tantalus and then of a curse placed upon pelops son of tantalus by myrtilus whom he had murdered
thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the house of atreus until atoned by orestes in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods
agamemnon gathers the reluctant greek forces to sail for troy
in order to recruit odysseus who is feigning madness so as to not have to go to war agamemnon sends palamedes who threatens to kill odysseus infant son telemachus
odysseus is forced to stop acting mad in order to save his son and joined the assembled greek forces
preparing to depart from aulis a port in boeotia agamemnons army incurs the wrath of the goddess artemis although the myths give various reasons for this
in aeschylus play agamemnon artemis is angry for she predicts that so many young men will die at troy whereas in sophocles electra agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to artemis and subsequently boasts that he is her equal in hunting
misfortunes including a plague and a lack of wind prevent the army from sailing
finally the prophet calchas announces that the wrath of the goddess can only be propitiated by the sacrifice of agamemnons daughter iphigenia
classical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter are to this fate some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to achilles but agamemnon does eventually sacrifice iphigenia
her death appeases artemis and the greek army set out for troy
several alternatives to the human sacrifice have been presented in greek mythology
other sources such as iphigenia at aulis say that agamemnon is prepared to kill his daughter but that artemis accepts a deer in her place and whisks her away to tauris in the crimean peninsula
however this version is widely considered to be the work of an interpolator and not euripides himself
hesiod says she became the goddess hecate
during the war but before the events of the iliad odysseus contrives a plan to get revenge on palamedes for threatening his sons life
by forging a letter from priam king of the trojans and caching some gold in palamedes tent odysseus has palamedes accused of treason and agamemnon orders him to be stoned to death
the iliad tells the story of the quarrel between agamemnon and achilles in the final year of the war
in book one following one of the achaean armys raids chryseis daughter of chryses one of apollos priests is taken as a war prize by agamemnon
chryses pleads with agamemnon to free his daughter but meets with little success
chryses then prays to apollo for the safe return of his daughter
apollo responds by unleashing a plague over the achaean army
the prophet calchas tells that the plague may be dispelled by returning chryseis to her father
after bitterly berating calchas for his painful prophecies first forcing him to sacrifice his daughter and now to return his concubine agamemnon reluctantly agrees
however agamemnon demands a new prize from the army as compensation and seizes achilles prize the beautiful captive briseis
this creates deadly resentment between achilles and agamemnon causing achilles to withdraw from battle and refuse to fight
agamemnon is then visited in a dream by zeus who tells him to rally his forces and attack the trojans
after several days of fighting including duels between menelaus and paris and between ajax and hector the achaeans are pushed back to the fortifications around their ships
in book nine agamemnon having realized achilless importance in winning the war sends ambassadors begging for achilles to return offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage
achilles refuses only being spurred back into action when patroclus is killed in battle by hector eldest son of king priam and queen hecuba
in book nineteen agamemnon reconciled with achilles gives him the offered rewards for returning to the war
achilles sets out to turn back the trojans and to duel with hector
after hectors death agamemnon assists achilles in performing patroclus funeral in book twenty three
agamemnon volunteers for the javelin throwing contest one of the games being held in patroclus honor but his skill with the javelin is so well known that achilles awards him the prize without contest
although not the equal of achilles in bravery agamemnon was a representative of kingly authority
as commander in chief he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle
his chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness an over exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult chryses and achilles thereby bringing great disaster upon the greeks
agamemnon was the commander in chief of the greeks during the trojan war
during the fighting agamemnon killed antiphus and fifteen other trojan soldiers according to one source
in the iliad itself he is shown to slaughter hundreds more in book eleven during his aristea loosely translated to day of glory which is the most similar to achilles aristea in book twenty one
even before his aristea agamemnon is considered to be one of the three best warriors on the greek side as proven when hector challenges any champion of the greek side to fight him in book seven and agamemnon is one of the three hector most wishes to fight out of the nine strongest greek warriors who volunteer
according to sophocless ajax after achilles had fallen in battle agamemnon and menelaus award achilles armor to odysseus
this angers ajax who feels he is now the strongest among the achaean warriors and so deserves the armor
ajax considers killing them but is driven to madness by athena and instead slaughters the herdsmen and cattle that had not yet been divided as spoils of war
he then commits suicide in shame for his actions
as ajax dies he curses the sons of atreus along with the entire achaean army
agamemnon and menelaus consider leaving ajaxs body to rot denying him a proper burial but are convinced otherwise by odysseus and ajaxs half brother teucer
after the capture of troy cassandra the doomed prophetess and daughter of priam fell to agamemnons lot in the distribution of the prizes of war
after a stormy voyage agamemnon and cassandra land in argolis or in another version are blown off course and land in aegisthuss country
clytemnestra agamemnons wife has taken aegisthus son of thyestes as a lover
when agamemnon comes home he is slain by aegisthus or by clytemnestra
according to the accounts given by pindar and the tragedians agamemnon is slain in a bath by his wife alone after being ensnared by a blanket or a net thrown over him to prevent resistance
this is the case in aeschyluss oresteia
in homers version of the story in the odyssey aegisthus ambushes and kills agamemnon in a feasting hall under the pretense of holding a feast in honor of agamemnons return home from troy
clytemnestra also kills cassandra
her motivations are her wrath at the sacrifice of iphigenia and her jealousy of cassandra and other war prizes taken by agamemnon
aegisthus and clytemnestra then rule agamemnons kingdom for a time aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for atreuss crimes against thyestes
agamemnons son orestes later avenges his fathers murder with the help or encouragement of his sister electra by murdering aegisthus and clytemnestra thereby inciting the wrath of the erinyes winged goddesses who track down wrongdoers with their hounds noses and drive them to insanity
agamemnons family history is rife with misfortune born from several curses contributing to the miasma around the family
the curse begins with agamemnons great grandfather tantalus who is in zeuss favor until he tries to feed his son pelops to the gods in order to test their omniscience as well as stealing some ambrosia and nectar
tantalus is then banished to the underworld where he stands in a pool of water that evaporates every time he reaches down to drink and above him is a fruit tree whose branches are blown just out of reach by the wind whenever he reaches for the fruit
this begins the cursed house of atreus and his descendants would face similar or worse fates
later using his relationship with poseidon pelops convinces the god to grant him a chariot so he may beat oenomaus king of pisa in a race and win the hand of his daughter hippodamia
myrtilus who in some accounts helps pelops win his chariot race attempts to lie with pelopss new bride hippodamia
in anger pelops throws myrtilus off a cliff but not before myrtilus curses pelops and his entire line
pelops and hippodamia have many children including atreus and thyestes who are said to have murdered their half brother chrysippus
pelops banishes atreus and thyestes to mycanae where atreus becomes king
thyestes later conspires with atreuss wife aerope to supplant atreus but they are unsuccessful
atreus then kills thyestes son and cooks him into a meal which thyestes eats and afterwards atreus taunts him with the hands and feet of his now dead son
thyestes on the advice of an oracle then has a son with his own daughter pelopia
pelopia tries to expose the infant aegisthus but he is found by a shepherd and raised in the house of atreus
when aegisthus reaches adulthood thyestes reveals the truth of his birth and aegithus then kills atreus
atreus and aerope have three children agamemnon menelaus and anaxibia
the continued miasma surrounding the house of atreus expresses itself in several events throughout their lives
agamemnon is forced to sacrifice his own daughter iphigenia to appease the gods and allow the greek forces to sail for troy
when agamemnon refuses to return chryseis to her father chryses he brings plague upon the greek camp
he is also later killed by his wife clytemnestra who conspires with her new lover aegisthus in revenge for the death of iphigenia
menelauss wife helen of troy runs away with paris ultimately leading to the trojan war
according to book of the odyssey after the war his fleet is scattered by the gods to egypt and crete
when menelaus finally returns home his marriage with helen is now strained and they produce no sons
both agamemnon and menelaus are cursed by ajax for not granting him achilless armor as he commits suicide
agamemnon and clytemnestra have three remaining children electra orestes and chrysothemis
after growing to adulthood and being pressured by electra orestes vows to avenge his father agamemnon by killing his mother clytemnestra and aegisthus
after successfully doing so he wanders the greek countryside for many years constantly plagued by the erinyes for his sins
finally with the help of athena and apollo he is absolved of his crimes dispersing the miasma and the curse on house atreus comes to an end
athenaeus tells a tale of how agamemnon mourns the loss of his friend or lover argynnus when he drowns in the cephisus river
he buries him honored with a tomb and a shrine to aphrodite argynnis
this episode is also found in clement of alexandria in stephen of byzantium and in propertius iii with minor variations
the fortunes of agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous tragedies ancient and modern the most famous being the oresteia of aeschylus
in the legends of the peloponnesus agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch and in sparta he was worshipped under the title of zeus agamemnon
his tomb was pointed out among the ruins of mycenae and at amyclae
in works of art there is considerable resemblance between the representations of zeus king of the gods and agamemnon king of men
he is generally depicted with a sceptre and diadem conventional attributes of kings
agamemnons mare is named aetha
she is also one of two horses driven by menelaus at the funeral games of patroclus
in homers odyssey agamemnon makes an appearance in the kingdom of hades after his death
there the former king meets odysseus and explains just how he was murdered before he offers odysseus a warning about the dangers of trusting a woman
agamemnon is a character in william shakespeares play troilus and cressida set during the trojan war
in frank herberts dune the house of atreides trace themselves back to the house of atreus
at a key point in children of dune alia atreides in a struggle with her ancestral memories hears agamemnon shouting i your ancestor agamemnon demand audience hasan ali shah known as aga khan i was the th imam of the nizari ismailis
he served as the governor of kirman and a prominent leader in iran and later in the indian subcontinent
he was the first nizari imam to hold the title aga khan
the imam hasan ali shah was born in in kahak iran to shah khalil allah iii the th ismaili imam and bibi sarkara the daughter of muhammad sadiq mahallati a poet and a nimat allahi sufi
shah khalil allah moved to yazd in probably out of concern for his indian followers who used to travel to persia to see their imam and for whom yazd was a much closer and safer destination than kahak
meanwhile his wife and children continued to live in kahak off the revenues obtained from the family holdings in the mahallat region
two years later in shah khalil allah was killed in yazd during a brawl between some of his followers and local shopkeepers
he was succeeded by his eldest son hasan ali shah also known as muhammad hasan who became the th imam
while khalil allah resided in yazd his land holdings in kahak were being managed by his son in law imani khan farahani husband of his daughter shah bibi
after khalil allahs death a conflict ensued between imani khan farahani and the local nizaris as a result of which khalil allahs widow and children found themselves left unprovided for
the young imam and his mother moved to qumm but their financial situation worsened
the dowager decided to go to the qajar court in tehran to obtain justice for her husbands death and was eventually successful
those who had been involved in the shah khalil allahs murder were punished
not only that but the persian king fath ali shah gave his own daughter princess sarv i jahan khanum in marriage to the young imam hasan ali shah and provided a princely dowry in land holdings in the mahallat region
king fath ali shah also appointed hasan ali shah as governor of qumm and bestowed upon him the honorific of aga khan
thus did the title of aga khan enter the family
hasan ali shah become known as aga khan mahallati and the title of aga khan was inherited by his successors
aga khan is mother later moved to india where she died in
until fath ali shahs death in the imam hasan ali shah enjoyed a quiet life and was held in high esteem at the qajar court
soon after the accession of muhammad shah qajar to the throne of his grandfather fath ali shah the imam hasan ali shah was appointed governor of kerman in
at the time kerman was held by the rebellious sons of shuja al saltana a pretender to the qajar throne
the area was also frequently raided by the afghans
hasan ali shah managed to restore order in kerman as well as in bam and narmashir which were also held by rebellious groups
hasan ali shah sent a report of his success to tehran but did not receive any material appreciation for his achievements
despite the service he rendered to the qajar government hasan ali shah was dismissed from the governorship of kerman in less than two years after his arrival there and was replaced by firuz mirza nusrat al dawla a younger brother of muhammad shah qajar
refusing to accept his dismissal hasan ali shah withdrew with his forces to the citadel at bam
along with his two brothers he made preparations to resist the government forces that were sent against him
he was besieged at bam for some fourteen months
when it was clear that continuing the resistance was of little use hasan ali shah sent one of his brothers to shiraz in order to speak to the governor of fars to intervene on his behalf and arrange for safe passage out of kerman
with the governor having interceded hasan ali shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of bam only to be double crossed
he was seized and his possessions were plundered by the government troops
hasan ali shah and his dependents were sent to kerman and remained as prisoners there for eight months
he was eventually allowed to go to tehran near the end of where he was able to present his case before the shah
the shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to mahallat
hasan ali shah remained in mahallat for about two years
he managed to gather an army in mahallat which alarmed muhammad shah who travelled to delijan near mahallat to determine the truth of the reports about hasan ali shah
hasan ali shah was on a hunting trip at the time but he sent a messenger to request permission of the monarch to go to mecca for the hajj pilgrimage
permission was given and hasan ali shahs mother and a few relatives were sent to najaf and other holy cities in iraq in which the shrines of his ancestors the shiite imams are found
prior to leaving mahallat hasan ali shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of kerman
accompanied by his brothers nephews and other relatives as well as many followers he left for yazd where he intended to meet some of his local followers
hasan ali shah sent the documents reinstating him to the position of governor of kerman to bahman mirza baha al dawla the governor of yazd
bahman mirza offered hasan ali shah lodging in the city but hasan ali shah declined indicating that he wished to visit his followers living around yazd
hajji mirza aqasi sent a messenger to bahman mirza to inform him of the spuriousness of hasan ali shahs documents and a battle between bahman mrz and hasan ali shah broke out in which bahman mirza was defeated
other minor battles were won by hasan ali shah before he arrived in shahr e babak which he intended to use as his base for capturing kerman
at the time of his arrival in shahr e babak a formal local governor was engaged in a campaign to drive out the afghans from the citys citadel and hasan ali shah joined him in forcing the afghans to surrender
soon after march hasan ali shah set out for kerman
he managed to defeat a government force consisting of men near dashtab and continued to win a number of victories before stopping at bam for a time
soon a government force of men forced hasan ali shah to flee from bam to rigan on the border of baluchistan where he suffered a decisive defeat
hasan ali shah decided to escape to afghanistan accompanied by his brothers and many soldiers and servants
fleeing iran hasan ali shah arrived in kandahar afghanistan in a town that had been occupied by an anglo indian army in in the first anglo afghan war
a close relationship developed between hasan ali shah and the british which coincided with the final years of the first anglo afghan war
after his arrival hasan ali shah wrote to sir william macnaghten discussing his plans to seize and govern herat on behalf of the british
although the proposal seemed to have been approved the plans of the british were thwarted by the uprising of dost muhammads son muhammad akbar khan who defeated and annihilated the british indian garrison at gandamak on its retreat from kabul in january
hasan ali shah soon proceeded to sindh where he rendered further services to the british
the british were able to annex sindh and for his services hasan ali shah received an annual pension of from general charles james napier the british conqueror of sindh with whom he had a good relationship
in october hasan ali shah left sindh for the city of bombay in the bombay presidency british india passing through cutch and kathiawar where he spent some time visiting the communities of his followers in the area
after arriving in bombay in february the persian government demanded his extradition from india
the british refused and only agreed to transfer hasan ali shahs residence to calcutta where it would be harder for him to launch new attacks against the persian government
the british also negotiated the safe return of hasan ali shah to persia which was in accordance with his own wish
the government agreed to hasan ali shahs return provided that he would avoid passing through baluchistan and kirman and that he was to settle peacefully in mahallat
hasan ali shah was eventually forced to leave for calcutta in april where he remained until he received news of the death of muhammad shah qajar
hasan ali shah left for bombay and the british attempted to obtain permission for his return to persia
although some of his lands were restored to the control of his relatives his safe return could not be arranged and hasan ali shah was forced to remain a permanent resident of india
while in india hasan ali shah continued his close relationship with the british and was even visited by the prince of wales when he was on a state visit to india
the british came to address hasan ali shah as his highness
hasan ali shah received protection from the british government in british india as the spiritual head of an important muslim community
the vast majority of his khoja ismaili followers in india welcomed him warmly but some dissident members sensing their loss of prestige with the arrival of the imam wished to maintain control over communal properties
because of this hasan ali shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the ismaili form of islam
although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by hasan ali shah summarizing the practices of the ismailis a group of dissenting khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been sunni
this group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the khojas assembled in bombay
in these dissenters filed a suit in the bombay high court against hasan ali shah claiming that the khojas had been sunni muslims from the very beginning
the case commonly referred to as the aga khan case was heard by sir joseph arnould
the hearing lasted several weeks and included testimony from hasan ali shah himself
after reviewing the history of the community justice arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of hasan ali shah and other defendants
the judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the khojas as a community referred to as shia nizari ismailis and of hasan ali shah as the spiritual head of that community
hasan ali shahs authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again
hasan ali shah spent his final years in bombay with occasional visits to pune
maintaining the traditions of the iranian nobility to which he belonged he kept excellent stables and became a well known figure at the bombay racecourse
hasan ali shah died after an imamate of sixty four years in april
he was buried in a specially built shrine at hasanabad in the mazagaon area of bombay
he was survived by three sons and five daughters
hasan ali shah was succeeded as imam by his eldest son aqa ali shah who became aga khan ii
sir sultan mahomed shah known as aga khan iii was the th imam of the nizari ismaili branch of shia islam
he was one of the founders and the first permanent president of the all india muslim league
his goal was the advancement of muslim agendas and the protection of muslim rights in british india
the league until the late s was not a large organisation but represented landed and commercial muslim interests as well as advocating for british education during the british raj
there were similarities in aga khans views on education with those of other muslim social reformers but the scholar shenila khoja moolji argues that he also expressed a distinct interest in advancing womens education for women themselves
aga khan called on the british raj to consider muslims to be a separate nation within india the famous two nation theory
even after he resigned as president of the aiml in he still exerted a major influence on its policies and agendas
he was nominated to represent india at the league of nations in and served as president of the league of nations from to

the aga khan travelled to distant parts of the world to receive the homage of his followers with the objective either of settling differences or of advancing their welfare through financial help and personal advice and guidance
the distinction of knight commander of the indian empire was conferred upon him by queen victoria in and he was promoted to knight grand commander in the coronation honours list and invested as such by king edward vii at buckingham palace on october

in he was made a member of the privy council and served as a member of the league of nations becoming the president of the league of nations in
under the leadership of sir sultan muhammad shah aga khan iii the first half of the th century was a period of significant development for the isml community
numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the indian subcontinent and in east africa
ismailis have marked the jubilees of their imms with public celebrations which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the isml imm and its followers
although the jubilees have no religious significance they serve to reaffirm the imamats worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life especially in developing countries
the jubilees of sir sultan mahomed shah aga khan iii are well remembered
during his years of imamat the community celebrated his golden diamond and platinum jubilees
to show their appreciation and affection the ismliyya weighed their imam in gold diamonds and symbolically platinum respectively the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in asia and africa
in india and later in pakistan social development institutions were established in the words of aga khan iii for the relief of humanity
they included institutions such as the diamond jubilee trust and platinum jubilee investments limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies
diamond jubilee high school for girls was established throughout the remote northern areas of what is now pakistan
in addition scholarship programmes established at the time of the golden jubilee to give assistance to needy students were progressively expanded
in east africa major social welfare and economic development institutions were established
those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres and a modern fully equipped hospital in nairobi
among the economic development institutions established in east africa were companies such as the diamond jubilee investment trust and the jubilee insurance company which are quoted on the nairobi stock exchange and have become major players in national development
sir sultan mahomed shah also introduced organisational reforms that gave isml communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs
these were built on the muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand and a responsible individual conscience with the freedom to negotiate ones own moral commitment and destiny on the other
in he ordained the first isml constitution for the social governance of the community in east africa
the new administration for the communitys affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local national and regional levels
the constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage divorce and inheritance guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among ismls and their interface with other communities
similar constitutions were promulgated in india and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings
in the aga khan was involved in the haji bibi case where he was questioned about the origin of his followers
in his response in addition to enumerating his followers in iran russia afghanistan central asia syria and other places he also noted that in hindustan and africa there are many guptis who believe in me i consider them shii imami ismailis by caste they are hindus
following the second world war far reaching social economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where ismls resided
in british rule in the indian subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign independent nations of india pakistan and later bangladesh resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property
in the middle east the suez crisis of as well as the preceding crisis in iran demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism which was as assertive of the regions social and economic aspirations as of its political independence
africa was also set on its course to decolonisation swept by what harold macmillan the then british prime minister termed the wind of change
by the early s most of east and central africa where the majority of the isml population on the continent resided including tanganyika kenya uganda madagascar rwanda burundi and zaire had attained their political independence
the aga khan was deeply influenced by the views of sir sayyid ahmad khan
along with sir sayyid the aga khan was one of the backers and founders of the aligarh university for which he tirelessly raised funds and to which he donated large sums of his own money
the aga khan himself can be considered an islamic modernist and an intellectual of the aligarh movement
from a religious standpoint the aga khan followed a modernist approach to islam
he believed there to be no contradiction between religion and modernity and urged muslims to embrace modernity
although he opposed a wholesale replication of western society by muslims the aga khan did believe increased contact with the west would be overall beneficial to muslim society
he was intellectually open to western philosophy and ideas and believed engagement with them could lead to a revival and renaissance within islamic thought
like many other islamic modernists the aga khan held a low opinion of the traditional religious establishment as well as what he saw as their rigid formalism legalism and literalism
instead he advocated for renewed ijtihd and ijm the latter of which he understood in a modernist way to mean consensus building
according to him muslims should go back to the original sources especially the qurn in order to discover the true essence and spirit of islam
once the principles of the faith were discovered they would be seen to be universal and modern
islam in his view had an underlying liberal and democratic spirit
he also called for full civil and religious liberties peace and disarmament and an end to all wars
the aga khan opposed sectarianism which he believed to sap the strength and unity of the muslim community
in specific he called for a rapprochement between sunnism and shism
this did not mean that he thought religious differences would go away and he himself instructed his isml followers to be dedicated to their own teachings
however he believed in unity through accepting diversity and by respecting differences of opinion
on his view there was strength to be found in the diversity of muslim traditions
the aga khan called for social reform in muslim society and he was able to implement them within his own isml community
as he believed islam to essentially be a humanitarian religion the aga khan called for the reduction and eradication of poverty
like sir sayyid the aga khan was concerned that muslims had fallen behind the hindu community in terms of education
according to him education was the path to progress
he was a tireless advocate for compulsory and universal primary education and also for the creation of higher institutions of learning
in terms of womens rights the aga khan was more progressive in his views than sir sayyid and many other islamic modernists of his time
the aga khan framed his pursuit of womens rights not simply in the context of women being better mothers or wives but rather for womens own benefit
he endorsed the spiritual equality of men and women in islam and he also called for full political equality
this included the right to vote and the right to an education
in regards to the latter issue he endorsed compulsory primary education for girls
he also encouraged women to pursue higher university level education and saw nothing wrong with co educational institutions
whereas sir sayyid prioritized the education of boys over girls the aga khan instructed his followers that if they had a son and daughter and if they could only afford to send one of them to school they should send the daughter over the boy
the aga khan campaigned against the institution of purda and zenna which he felt were oppressive and un islamic institutions
he completely banned the purda and the face veil for his isml followers
the aga khan also restricted polygamy encouraged marriage to widows and banned child marriage
he also made marriage and divorce laws more equitable to women
overall he encouraged women to take part in all national activities and to agitate for their full religious social and political rights
today in large part due to the aga khans reforms the isml community is one of the most progressive peaceful and prosperous branches of islam
he was an owner of thoroughbred racing horses including a record equaling five winners of the derby and a total of sixteen winners of british classic races
he was a british flat racing champion owner thirteen times
according to ben pimlott biographer of queen elizabeth ii the aga khan presented her majesty with a filly called astrakhan who won at hurst park racecourse in
in the aga khan gave a cup to be awarded to the winners of an international team show jumping competition held at the annual horse show of the royal dublin society in dublin ireland every first week in august
it attracts competitors from all of the main show jumping nations and is carried live on irish national television
he wrote a number of books and papers two of which are of immense importance namely india in transition about the prepartition politics of india and the memoirs of aga khan world enough and time his autobiography
the aga khan iii proposed the south asiatic federation in india in transition that india might be re organized into some states and those states should have own autonomies
he was the first person who designed a detailed plan of such a federation of india
aga khan iii was succeeded as aga khan by his grandson karim aga khan who is the present imam of the ismaili muslims
at the time of his death on july his family members were in versoix
a solicitor brought the will of the aga khan iii from london to geneva and read it before the family ever since the time of my ancestor ali the first imam that is to say over a period of thirteen hundred years it has always been the tradition of our family that each imam chooses his successor at his absolute and unfettered discretion from amongst any of his descendants whether they be sons or remote male issue and in these circumstances and in view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world in very recent years due to the great changes which have taken place including the discoveries of atomic science i am convinced that it is in the best interest of the shia muslim ismailia community that i should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed during recent years and in the midst of the new age and who brings a new outlook on life to his office as imam
for these reasons i appoint my grandson karim the son of my own son aly salomone khan to succeed to the title of aga khan and to the imam and pir of all shia ismailian followers he is buried in the mausoleum of aga khan on the nile in aswan egypt
pakistan post issued a special birth centenary of agha khan iii postage stamp in his honor in
pakistan post again issued a postage stamp in his honor in its pioneers of freedom series in

hulbert persuaded them along with a group of friends to purchase a controlling interest in the mines which later became known as the calumet and hecla mining company based in calumet michigan
that summer he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise
over the winter of and early mining operations began to falter due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate
hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures
but agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines
he returned to the mines in march with his wife and young son
at that time calumet was a remote settlement virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer
with insufficient supplies at the mines agassiz struggled to maintain order while back in boston shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests
shaw obtained financial assistance from john simpkins the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations
agassiz continued to live at calumet making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to boston in before winter closed navigation
the mines continued to prosper and in may several mines were consolidated to form the calumet and hecla mining company with shaw as its first president
in august shaw retired to the board of directors and agassiz became president a position he held until his death
until the turn of the century this company was by far the largest copper producer in the united states many years producing over half of the total
agassiz was a major factor in the mines continued success and visited the mines twice a year
he innovated by installing a giant engine known as the superior which was able to lift tons of rock from a depth of
he also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters
however after a time the mines did not require his full time year round attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at harvard
out of his copper fortune he gave some us to harvard for the museum of comparative zoology and other purposes
shortly after the death of his father in agassiz acquired a small peninsula in newport rhode island which features views of narragansett bay
here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence
the house was completed in and today is known as the inn at castle hill
he was a member of the scientific expedition to south america in where he inspected the copper mines of peru and chile and made extended surveys of lake titicaca besides collecting invaluable peruvian antiquities which he gave to the museum of comparative zoology of which he was first curator from to and then director until his death in his personal secretary elizabeth hodges clark running the day to day management of the mcz when his work took him abroad
he assisted charles wyville thomson in the examination and classification of the collections of the challenger expedition and wrote the review of the echini in the reports
between and he took part in the three dredging expeditions of the steamer blake of the coast survey and presented a full account of them in two volumes
also in he was elected as a member of the american philosophical society
in agassiz visited fiji and queensland and inspected the great barrier reef publishing a paper on the subject in
of agassizs other writings on marine zoology most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology
however in he published with elizabeth cary agassiz his stepmother seaside studies in natural history a work at once exact and stimulating
they also published in marine animals of massachusetts bay
he received the german order pour le mrite for science and arts in august
agassiz served as a president of the national academy of sciences which since has awarded the alexander agassiz medal in his memory
he died in on board the rms adriatic en route to new york from southampton
he and his wife anna russell were the parents of three sons george russell agassiz maximilian agassiz and rodolphe louis agassiz
alexander agassiz is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard anolis agassizi and a fish leptochilichthys agassizii
a statue of alexander agassiz erected in is located in calumet michigan next to his summer home where he stayed while fulfilling his duties as the president of the calumet and hecla mining company
the company headquarters agassiz statue and many other buildings and landmarks from the now defunct company are today administered and maintained by the keweenaw national historical park whose headquarters overlook the statue of agassiz
a major building of the hopkins marine station is named after him
agathon was an athenian tragic poet whose works have been lost
he is best known for his appearance in platos symposium which describes the banquet given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first tragedy at the lenaia in
he is also a prominent character in aristophanes comedy the thesmophoriazusae
agathon was the son of tisamenus and the lover of pausanias with whom he appears in both the symposium and platos protagoras
together with pausanias he later moved to the court of archelaus king of macedon who was recruiting playwrights it is here that he probably died around bc
agathon introduced certain innovations into the greek theater aristotle tells us in the poetics that the characters and plot of his anthos were original and not following athenian dramatic orthodoxy borrowed from mythological or historical subjects
agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays
agathon is portrayed by plato as a handsome young man well dressed of polished manners courted by the fashion wealth and wisdom of athens and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement
the epideictic speech in praise of love which agathon recites in the symposium is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of gorgias
in the symposium agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet aristophanes but this alleged friendship did not prevent aristophanes from harshly criticizing agathon in at least two of his comic plays the thesmophoriazousae and the gerytades
in the later play frogs aristophanes softens his criticisms but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on agathons name that he makes dionysus call him a good poet
agathon was also a friend of euripides another recruit to the court of archelaus of macedon
agathons extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources the historian w
rhys roberts observes that has become almost a stereotyped phrase
the most detailed surviving description of agathon is in the thesmophoriazousae in which agathon appears as a pale clean shaven young man dressed in womens clothes
scholars are unsure how much of aristophanes portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention
after a close reading of the thesmophoriazousae the historian jane mcintosh snyder observed that agathons costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet anacreon as he is portrayed in early th century vase paintings
snyder theorizes that agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow poet although by agathons time such clothing especially the had long fallen out of fashion for men
according to this interpretation agathon is mocked in the thesmophoriazousae not only for his notorious effeminacy but also for the pretentiousness of his dress he seems to think of himself in all his elegant finery as a rival to the old ionian poets perhaps even to anacreon himself
although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries it was probably not composed for agathon the tragedian nor was it composed by plato
stylistic evidence suggests that the poem was actually written sometime after plato had died its form is that of the hellenistic erotic epigram which did not become popular until after bc
according to th century scholar walther ludwig the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of plato sometime between bc and bc and adopted by later writers from this source
fragments in a nauck tragicorum graecorum fragmenta
fragments in greek with english translations in matthew wrights the lost plays of greek tragedy neglected authors agesilaus ii was king of sparta from c
to c
generally considered the most important king in the history of sparta agesilaus was the main actor during the period of spartan hegemony that followed the peloponnesian war
although brave in combat agesilaus lacked the diplomatic skills to preserve spartas position especially against the rising power of thebes which reduced sparta to a secondary power after its victory at leuctra in bc
despite the traditional secrecy fostered by the spartiates the reign of agesilaus is particularly well known thanks to the works of his friend xenophon who wrote a large history of greece covering the years to bc therefore extensively dealing with agesilaus rule
xenophon furthermore composed a panegyric biography of his friend perhaps to clean his memory from the criticisms voiced against him
another historical tradition much more hostile to agesilaus than xenophons writings has been preserved in the hellenica oxyrhynchia and later continued by diodorus of sicily
moreover plutarch wrote a biography of agesilaus in his parallel lives which contains many elements deliberately omitted by xenophon
agesilaus father was king archidamos ii who belonged to the eurypontid dynasty one of the two royal families of sparta
archidamos already had a son from a first marriage with lampito named agis
after the death of lampito archidamos remarried in the early s with eupolia daughter of melesippidas whose name indicates an aristocratic status
the dates of agesilaus birth death and reign are disputed
the only secured information is that he was at his death
the majority opinion is to date his birth to but a minority of scholars move it a bit later c
most of the other dates of agesilaus are similarly disputed with the minority moving them about two years later than the majority
agesilaus also had a sister named kyniska
the name agesilaus was rare and harks back to agesilaus i one of the earliest kings of sparta
agesilaus was born lame a fact that should have cost him his life since in sparta deformed babies were thrown into a chasm
as he was not heir apparent he might have received some leniency from the tribal elders who examined male infants or perhaps the first effects of the demographic decline of sparta were already felt at the time and only the most severely impaired babies were killed
starting at the age of agesilaus had to go through the rigorous education system of sparta called the agoge
despite his disability he brilliantly completed the training which massively enhanced his prestige especially after he became king
indeed as heirs apparent were exempted of the agoge few spartan kings had gone through the same training as the citizens another notable exception was leonidas the embodiment of the hero king
between and agesilaus also became the younger lover of lysander an aristocrat from the circle of archidamos whose family had some influence in libya
little is known of agesilaus adult life before his reign principally because xenophon his friend and main biographer only wrote about his reign
due to his special status agesilaus likely became a member of the krypteia an elite corps of young spartans going undercover in spartan territory to kill some helots deemed dangerous
once he turned and became a full citizen agesilaus was elected to a common mess presumably that of his elder half brother agis ii who had become king in of which lysander was perhaps a member
agesilaus probably served during the peloponnesian war against athens likely at the battle of mantinea in
agesilaus married kleora at some point between and
despite the influence she apparently had on her husband she is mostly unknown
her father was aristomenidas an influential noble with connections in thebes
thanks to three treaties signed with persia in sparta received funding from the persians which it used to build a fleet that ultimately defeated athens
this fleet was essentially led by lysander whose success gave him an enormous influence in the greek cities of asia as well as in sparta where he even schemed to become king
in the two kings agis and pausanias acted together to relieve him from his command
agis ii died while returning from delphi between and
after his funeral agesilaus contested the claim of leotychidas the son of agis ii using the widespread belief in sparta that leotychidas was an illegitimate son of alcibiades a famous athenian statesman and nephew of pericles who had gone into exile in sparta during the peloponnesian war and then seduced the queen
the rumours were strengthened by the fact that even agis only recognised leotychidas as his son on his deathbed
diopeithes a supporter of leotychidas however quoted an old oracle telling that a spartan king could not be lame thus refuting agesilaus claim but lysander cunningly returned the objection by saying that the oracle had to be understood figuratively
the lameness warned against by the oracle would therefore refer to the doubt on leotychidas paternity and this reasoning won the argument
the role of lysander in the accession of agesilaus has been debated among historians principally because plutarch makes him the main instigator of the plot while xenophon downplays lysanders influence
lysander doubtless supported agesilaus accession because he hoped that the new king would in return help him to regain the importance that he lost in
the conspiracy of cinadon took place during the first year of agesilaus reign in the summer of
cinadon was a hypomeion a spartan who had lost his citizen status presumably because he could not afford the price of the collective mess one of the main reasons for the dwindling number of spartan citizens in the classical era called oliganthropia
it is probable that the vast influx of wealth coming to the city after its victory against athens in triggered inflation in sparta which impoverished many citizens with a fixed income like cinadon and caused their downgrade
therefore the purpose of the plot was likely to restore the status of these disfranchised citizens
however the plot was uncovered and cinadon and its leaders executed probably with the active participation of agesilaus but no further action was taken to solve the social crisis at the origin of the conspiracy
the failure of agesilaus to acknowledge the critical problem suffered by sparta at the time has been criticised by modern historians
according to the treaties signed in and between sparta and the persian empire the latter became the overlord of the greek city states of asia minor
in these cities and sparta supported the bid of cyrus the younger against his elder brother the new emperor artaxerxes ii who nevertheless defeated cyrus at cunaxa
as a result sparta remained at war with artaxerxes and supported the greek cities of asia which fought against tissaphernes the satrap of lydia and caria
in lysander engineered a large expedition in asia headed by agesilaus likely to recover the influence he had over the asian cities at the end of the peloponnesian war
in order to win the approval of the spartan assembly lysander built an army with only spartan citizens so the risk would be limited the bulk of the army consisted of neodamodes and greek allies
in addition agesilaus obtained the support of the oracles of zeus at olympia and apollo at delphi
lysander and agesilaus had intended the expedition to be a panhellenic enterprise but athens corinth and especially thebes refused to participate
in spring agesilaus came to aulis to sacrifice on the place where agamemnon had done so just before his departure to troy at the head of the greek army in the iliad thus giving a grandiose aspect to the expedition
however he did not inform the boeotians and brought his own seer to perform the sacrifice instead of the local one
learning this the boeotians prevented him from sacrificing and further humiliated him by casting away the victim they perhaps intended to provoke a confrontation as the relations between sparta and thebes had become execrable
agesilaus then left to asia but thebes remained hateful to him for the rest of his life
once agesilaus landed in ephesus the spartan main base he concluded a three months truce with tissaphernes likely to settle the affairs among the greek allies
he integrated some of the greek mercenaries formerly hired by cyrus the younger in his army
they had returned from persia under the leadership of xenophon who also remained in agesilaus staff
in ephesus agesilaus authority was nevertheless overshadowed by lysander who was reacquainted with many of his supporters men he had placed in control of the greek cities at the end of the peloponnesian war
angered by his local aura agesilaus humiliated lysander several times to force him to leave the army despite his former relationship and lysanders role in his accession to the throne
plutarch adds that after agesilaus emancipation from him lysander returned to his undercover scheme to make the monarchy elective
after lysanders departure agesilaus raided phrygia the satrapy of pharnabazus until his advance guard was defeated not far from daskyleion by the superior persian cavalry
he then wintered at ephesus where he trained a cavalry force perhaps on the advice of xenophon who had commanded the cavalry of the ten thousand
in the spartan king managed to trick tissaphernes into thinking that he would attack caria in the south of asia minor forcing the satrap to hold a defence line on the meander river
instead agesilaus moved north to the important city of sardis
tissaphernes hastened to meet the king there but his cavalry sent in advance was defeated by agesilaus army
after his victory at the battle of sardis agesilaus became the first king to be given the command of both land and sea
he delegated the naval command to his brother in law peisander whom he appointed navarch despite his inexperience perhaps agesilaus wanted to avoid the rise of a new lysander who owed his prominence to his time as navarch
after his defeat tissaphernes was executed and replaced as satrap by tithraustes who gave agesilaus talents to move north to the satrapy of pharnabazus
augesilaus phrygian campaign of was fruitless as he lacked the siege equipment required to take the fortresses of leonton kephalai gordion and miletou teichosxenophon tells that agesilaus then wanted to campaign further east in asia and sow discontent among the subjects of the achaemenid empire or even to conquer asia
plutarch went further and wrote that agesilaus had prepared an expedition to the heart of persia up to her capital of susa thus making him a forerunner of alexander the great
it is very unlikely that agesilaus really had such a grand campaign in mind regardless he was soon forced to return to europe in
although thebes and corinth had been allies of sparta throughout the peloponnesian war they were dissatisfied by the settlement of the war in with sparta as leader of the greek world
spartas imperialist expansion in the aegean greatly upset its former allies notably by establishing friendly regimes and garrisons in smaller cities
through large gifts tithraustes also encouraged spartas former allies to start a war in order to force the recall of agesilaus from asia even though the influence of persian gold has been exaggerated
the initiative came from thebes which provoked a war between their ally ozolian locris and phocis in order to bring sparta to the latters defence
lysander and the other king pausanias entered boeotia which enabled the thebans to bring athens in the war
lysander then besieged haliartus without waiting for pausanias and was killed in a boeotian counter attack
in sparta pausanias was condemned to death by lysanders friends and went into exile
after its success at haliartus thebes was able to build a coalition against sparta with notably argos and corinth where a war council was established and securing the defection of most of the cities of northern and central greece
unable to wage war on two fronts and with the loss of lysander and pausanias sparta had no choice but to recall agesilaus from asia
the asian greeks fighting for him said they wanted to continue serving with him while agesilaus promised he would return to asia as soon as he could
agesilaus returned to greece by land crossing the hellespont and from there along the coast of the aegean sea
in thessaly he won a cavalry battle near narthacium against the pharsalians who had made an alliance with thebes
he then entered boeotia by the thermopylae where he received reinforcements from sparta
meanwhile aristodamos the regent of the young agiad king agesipolis won a major victory at nemea near argos which was offset by the disaster of the spartan navy at knidos against the persian fleet led by konon an exiled athenian general
agesilaus lied to his men about the outcome of the battle of knidos to avoid demoralising them as they were about to fight a large engagement against the combined armies of thebes athens argos and corinth
the following battle of coroneia was a classic clash between two lines of hoplites
the anti spartan allies were rapidly defeated but the thebans managed to retreat in good order despite agesilaus activity on the front line which caused him several injuries
the next day the thebans requested a truce to recover their dead therefore conceding defeat although they had not been bested on the battlefield
agesilaus appears to have tried to win an honourable victory by risking his life and being merciful with some thebans who had sought shelter in the nearby temple of athena itonia
he then moved to delphi where he offered one tenth of the booty he had amassed since his landing at ephesos and returned to sparta
no pitched battle took place in greece in
perhaps agesilaus was still recovering from his wounds or he was deprived of command because of the opposition of lysanders and pausanias friends who were disappointed by his lack of decisive victory and his appointment of peisander as navarch before the disaster of knidos
the loss of the spartan fleet besides allowed konon to capture the island of kythera in the south of the peloponnese from where he could raid spartan territory
in sparta sent antalcidas to asia in order to negotiate a general peace with tiribazus the satrap of lydia while sparta would recognise persias sovereignty over the asian greek cities
however the greek allies also sent emissaries to sardis to refuse antalcidas plan and artaxerxes likewise rejected it
a second peace conference in sparta failed the following year because of athens
a personal enemy of antalcidas agesilaus likely disapproved these talks which show that his influence at home had waned
plutarch says that he befriended the young agiad king agesipolis possibly to prevent his opponents from coalescing behind him
by agesilaus had apparently recovered his influence as he was appointed at the head of the army while his half brother teleutias became navarch
the target was argos which had absorbed corinth into a political union the previous year
in bc he made several successful expeditions into corinthian territory capturing lechaeum and peiraion
the loss however of a battalion destroyed by iphicrates neutralised these successes and agesilaus returned to sparta
in bc he conducted a campaign in acarnania but two years later the peace of antalcidas warmly supported by agesilaus put an end to the war maintaining spartan hegemony over greece and returning the greek cities of asia minor to the achaemenid empire
in this interval agesilaus declined command over spartas aggression on mantineia and justified phoebidas seizure of the theban cadmea so long as the outcome provided glory to sparta
when war broke out afresh with thebes agesilaus twice invaded boeotia although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness
in the congress of an altercation is recorded between him and the theban general epaminondas and due to his influence thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace and orders given for agesilauss royal colleague cleombrotus to march against thebes in
cleombrotus was defeated and killed at the battle of leuctra and the spartan supremacy overthrown
in agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to mantineia and reassured the spartans with an invasion of arcadia
he preserved an unwalled sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of helots perioeci and even other spartans and against external enemies with four different armies led by epaminondas penetrating laconia that same year
in bc sparta and athens dissatisfied with the persian kings support of thebes following the embassy of philiscus of abydos decided to provide careful military support to the opponents of the achaemenid king
athens and sparta provided support for the revolting satraps in the revolt of the satraps in particular ariobarzanes sparta sent a force to ariobarzanes under an aging agesilaus while athens sent a force under timotheus which was however diverted when it became obvious that ariobarzanes had entered frontal conflict with the achaemenid king
an athenian mercenary force under chabrias was also sent to the egyptian pharaoh tachos who was also fighting against the achaemenid king
according to xenophon agesilaus in order to gain money for prosecuting the war supported the satrap ariobarzanes of phrygia in his revolt against artaxerxes ii in
again in epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city of sparta with a rapid and unexpected march
the battle of mantinea in which agesilaus took no part was followed by a general peace sparta however stood aloof hoping even yet to recover her supremacy
sometime after the battle of mantineia agesilaus went to egypt at the head of a mercenary force to aid the king nectanebo i and his regent teos against persia
in the summer of he transferred his services to teoss cousin and rival nectanebo ii who in return for his help gave him a sum of over talents
on his way home agesilaus died in cyrenaica around the age of after a reign of some years
his body was embalmed in wax and buried at sparta
he was succeeded by his son archidamus iii
agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance and was lame from birth
these facts were used as an argument against his succession an oracle having warned sparta against a lame reign
most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in guerrilla warfare alert and quick yet cautious a man moreover whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time
of his courage temperance and hardiness many instances are cited and to these were added the less spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend
as examples there was the story of his riding a stick horse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that the friend not mention what he had seen until he was the father of children and because of the affection of his son archidamus for cleonymus he saved sphodrias cleonymus father from execution for his incursion into piraeus and dishonourable retreat in
modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of agesilaus reputation and achievements reckoning him an excellent soldier but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and siege craft
as a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies
agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in asia and in extreme age maintaining his prostrate country
other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to spartan decline notably his unremitting hatred of thebes which led to spartas humiliation at the battle of leuctra and thus the end of spartan hegemony
historian j
bury remarks that there is something melancholy about his career born into a sparta that was the unquestioned continental power of hellas the sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forebears had seen its population severely decline and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory
plutarch also describes how often to remove the threat of instigators of internal dissension agesilaus would send his enemies abroad with governorships where they often were corrupt and procured themselves enemies
agesilaus would then protect them against these new enemies of theirs so as to make them his friends
as a result he no longer had to face internal opposition as his enemies had henceforth become allies
as for his personal life though he had two daughters eupolia and prolyta and a wife cleora he nontheless had the habbit of forming homoosexual attachments for young men
other historical accounts paint agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader
his awareness thoughtfulness and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomised the heroic greek commander
these historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by lysander in the former athenian empire and the failures of spartan leaders for the eventual suppression of spartan power
the ancient historian xenophon was a huge admirer and served under agesilaus during the campaigns into asia minor
agesilaus lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth
antonio agliardi was an italian roman catholic cardinal archbishop and papal diplomat
agliardi was born at cologno al serio in what is now the province of bergamo
he studied theology and canon law and after acting as parish priest in his native diocese for twelve years was sent by the pope to canada as a bishops chaplain
on his return he was appointed secretary to the congregation of the propaganda
in he was created by pope leo xiii archbishop of caesarea in partibus and sent to india as an apostolic delegate to report on the establishment of the hierarchy there
in he again visited india to carry out the terms of the concordat arranged with portugal
the same year he was appointed secretary of the congregation super negotiis ecclesiae extraordinariis
in he became papal apostolic nuncio to bavaria at munich and in at vienna
allowing himself to be involved in the ecclesiastical disputes that divided hungary in he was made the subject of formal complaint by the hungarian government and in was recalled
in the consistory of he was elevated to cardinal priest of santi nereo e achilleo
in he was made cardinal bishop of albano
in he was named vice chancellor of the catholic church and became the chancellor of the apostolic chancery in the secretariat of state in
he died in rome and was buried in bergamo
agnes of merania was queen of france by marriage to king philip ii
she is called marie by some of the french chroniclers
agnes maria was the daughter of berthold duke of merania and agnes of rochlitz
in june agnes married philip ii of france who had repudiated his second wife ingeborg of denmark in
pope innocent iii espoused the cause of ingeborg but philip did not submit until when nine months after interdict had been added to excommunication he consented to a separation from agnes
agnes died giving birth to their third child in july of the next year at the castle of poissy and was buried in the convent of st corentin near nantes
both were legitimized by the pope in
agrippina the elder was a prominent member of the julio claudian dynasty
she was the daughter of marcus vipsanius agrippa and augustus daughter julia the elder
her brothers lucius and gaius caesar were the adoptive sons of augustus and were his heirs until their deaths in ad and respectively
following their deaths her second cousin germanicus was made the adoptive son of tiberius augustus stepson as part of the succession scheme in the adoptions of ad
as a result of the adoption agrippina was wed to germanicus in order to bring him closer to the julian family
agrippina the elder is known to have traveled with germanicus throughout his career taking her children wherever they went
in ad germanicus was deployed in gaul as a governor and general and while there the late augustus sent her son gaius to stay with her
agrippina liked to dress him in a little soldiers outfit for which gaius earned the nickname caligula
after three years in gaul they returned to rome and her husband was awarded a triumph on may ad to commemorate his victories
the following year germanicus was sent to govern over the eastern provinces
while germanicus was active in his administration the governor of syria gnaeus calpurnius piso began feuding with him
during the feud her husband died of illness on october ad
germanicus was cremated in antioch and she transported his ashes to rome where they were interred at the mausoleum of augustus
agrippina was vocal in claims of her husband being murdered in order to promote tiberius son drusus julius caesar as heir
following the model of her stepgrandmother livia she spent the time following germanicus death supporting the cause of her sons nero and drusus caesar
this put her and her sons at odds with the powerful praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus who began eliminating their supporters with accusations of treason and sexual misconduct in ad
her familys rivalry with sejanus would culminate with her and neros exile in ad
nero was exiled to pontia and she was exiled to the island of pandateria where she would remain until her death by starvation in ad
following the roman custom of parents and children sharing the same nomen and cognomen women in the same family would often share the same name
accordingly marcus vipsanius agrippa first daughter with attica was named vipsania agrippina
to distinguish agrippa and julias daughter from their granddaughter julia agrippina historians refer to this daughter as agrippina the elder
likewise agrippinas daughter is referred to as agrippina the younger
like her father agrippina the elder avoided her nomen and has not been found to have used vipsania in inscription
an inscription in rhodiapolis records her with the nomen julia although this appears to be a mistake
marcus vipsanius agrippa was an early supporter of augustus
he was a key general in augustus armies commanding troops during the wars against sextus pompey and mark antony
from early in the emperors reign agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of augustus who appeared to be on his deathbed in bc a sign that he would become princeps were augustus to die
it is probable that he was to rule until the emperors nephew marcus claudius marcellus came of age
however marcellus died that year of an illness that became an epidemic in rome
now with marcellus dead augustus arranged for the marriage of agrippa to his daughter julia the elder who was previously the wife of marcellus
agrippa was given tribunicia potestas in bc a power that only the emperor and his immediate heir could hope to attain
the tribunician power allowed him to control the senate and it was first given to julius caesar
agrippa acted as tribune in the senate to pass important legislation and though he lacked some of the emperors power and authority he was approaching the position of co regent
after the birth of agrippas second son lucius in bc lucius and his brother gaius were adopted together by augustus
around the time of their adoption in the summer augustus held the fifth ever ludi saeculares
cassius dio says the adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace the pax augusta
it is not known what agrippa thought of their adoption however following their adoption agrippa was dispatched to govern the eastern provinces bringing his family with him
agrippina was born in bc to marcus vipsanius agrippa and julia the elder before their return to rome in bc
she had several siblings including half sisters vipsania agrippina vipsania attica vipsania marcella and vipsania marcellina and four full siblings with three brothers gaius lucius and postumus agrippa and a sister julia the younger
she was a prominent member of the julio claudian dynasty
on her mothers side she was the younger granddaughter of augustus
she was the stepdaughter of tiberius by her mothers marriage to him and sister in law of claudius the brother of her husband germanicus
her son gaius better known as caligula would be the third emperor and her grandson nero would be the last emperor of the dynasty
in bc her father returned to rome and was promptly sent to pannonia to suppress a rebellion
agrippa arrived there that winter but the pannonians gave up that same year
agrippa returned to campania in italy where he fell ill and died soon after
after her fathers death she spent the rest of her childhood in augustus household where access to her was strictly controlled
some of the currency issued in bc the aurei and denarii make it clear that her brothers gaius and lucius were augustus intended heirs
their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the emperor were to die and augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen
lucius and gaius military and political careers would steadily advance until their deaths in ad and respectively
the death of her brothers meant that augustus had to find other heirs
although he initially considered agrippinas second cousin germanicus a potential heir for a time livia convinced augustus to adopt tiberius livias son from her first marriage with tiberius claudius nero
although augustus adopted tiberius it was on condition that tiberius first adopt germanicus so that germanicus would become second in the line of succession
it was a corollary to the adoption probably in the next year that agrippina was married to germanicus
by her husband germanicus she had nine children nero julius caesar drusus julius caesar tiberius julius caesar a child of unknown name gaius the elder the emperor caligula the empress agrippina the younger julia drusilla and julia livilla
only six of her children came of age tiberius and ignotus died as infants and gaius the elder in his early childhood
her husbands career in the military began in ad with the batonian war in pannonia and dalmatia
throughout germanicus military career agrippina is known to have traveled with her husband and their children
germanicus career advanced steadily as he advanced in ranks following the cursus honorum until in ad he was made consul
the following year he was given command over gaul and the forces on the rhine totaling eight legions
on may ad her one year old son gaius was sent by augustus from rome to join her in gaul
she was pregnant at the time and while germanicus was collecting taxes across gaul she remained at an unspecified separate location presumably for her safety
augustus sent her a letter with her sons party which read later that year on august augustus died while away in campania
as a result tiberius was made princeps
while germanicus was administering the oath of fealty to tiberius a mutiny began among the forces on the rhine
during the mutiny agrippina brought out their sixth child gaius and made preparations to take him away to a safer town nearby
he was in a full army outfit including the legionary hobnailed boots
these military booties earned gaius the nickname caligula and garnered sympathy for agrippina and the child among the soldiery
tacitus attributes her actions as having quelled the mutiny
once the mutiny was put to an end germanicus allowed the soldiers to deal with the ringleaders which they did with brutal severity
he then led them against the germanic tribes perhaps in an effort to prevent future mutiny
germanicus would remain in gaul fighting against the germanic tribes until ad at which time he was recalled to rome by tiberius
his campaigns won him much renown among the roman people and he was awarded a triumph on may ad
in ad agrippina left for the eastern provinces with her family
germanicus was sent the east to govern the provinces the same assignment her father was given years earlier
agrippina was pregnant on their journey east and on the way to syria she gave birth to her youngest daughter julia livilla on the island of lesbos
inscriptions celebrating her fertility have been found on the island
tiberius sent gnaeus calpurnius piso to assist her husband naming him governor of syria
during their time there germanicus was active in his administration of the eastern regions
piso did not get along well with germanicus and their relationship only got worse
in ad germanicus ordered piso to leave the province which piso began to do
on his way back to rome piso stopped at the island of kos off the coast of syria
around that time germanicus fell ill and he died on october ad at antioch
rumours spread of piso poisoning her husband on the emperors orders
after germanicus cremation in the forum of antioch agrippina personally carried the ashes of her husband to rome
the transportation of the ashes witnessed national mourning
she landed at the port of brundisium in southern italy where she was met with huge crowds of sympathizers a praetorian escort was provided by the emperor in light of her rank as the wife of a governor general
as she passed each town the people and local magistrates came out to show their respect
drusus the younger claudius and the consuls journeyed to join the procession as well
once she made it to rome her husbands ashes were interred at the mausoleum of augustus
tiberius and livia did not make an appearance
her marriage to germanicus had served to unite the imperial family
agrippina may have suspected tiberius involvement in the death of her husband and with germanicus dead she no longer had any familial ties to the emperor
historian richard alston says it is likely that either tiberius or livia were behind the exile of agrippinas sister julia the younger and the death of postumus
he notes the death of agrippinas mother who starved herself to death amidst her exile in ad linking her death to tiberius disdain for her
agrippina was vocal about her feelings claiming that germanicus was murdered to promote drusus the younger as tiberius heir and worried that the birth of the younger drusus twin sons would displace her own sons in the line of succession
at about this time tiberius praetorian prefect sejanus was becoming powerful in rome and began feuding with drusus the younger
while the exact causes of the feud are unknown it ended when the younger drusus died of seemingly natural causes on september ad
after the death of tiberius son agrippina wanted to advance the careers of her sons who were all potential heirs for tiberius
it has been suggested that to achieve this agrippina commissioned the great cameo of france and presented it to tiberius as a personalized gift that positioned the family of germanicus around the emperor
the work was designed to convince tiberius to choose her children as his heirs
ultimately the death of tiberius son elevated her own children to the position of heirs
her sons were the logical choice because they were the sons of germanicus and tiberius grandsons were too young
nero was becoming popular in the senate due in part tacitus says to his resemblance with his father
the rise of her children was threatening to sejanus position
resultantly sejanus began spreading rumors about agrippina in the imperial court
the coming years were marked with increasing hostility between sejanus and agrippina and her sons
this effectively caused factions to rise in the aristocracy between her family and sejanus
on new years day ad sejanus had the priests and magistrates add prayers for the health of nero and drusus in addition to those normally offered to the emperor on that day
tiberius was not happy with this and he voiced his displeasure in the senate
in addition he questioned the priests of the palatine
some of the priests who offered the prayers were relatives of agrippina and germanicus
this made tiberius suspicious of her and marked a change in his attitude toward her and her older sons but not caligula
in ad sejanus requested livillas hand in marriage
livilla was a niece of the emperor which would have made him a member of the imperial family
while this did make his ambitions clear his request was denied
the loss may have been huge for sejanus had the dissensions in the imperial household not been deteriorating
relations were so bad that agrippina refused to eat at tiberius dinner parties for fear of being poisoned
she also asked tiberius if she could be allowed to remarry which he also refused
if either of them were allowed to remarry it would have threatened the line of succession that tiberius was comfortable with
by refusing sejanus request tiberius made it clear he was content with the children of germanicus and his own grandchildren being his successors
had sejanus married livilla their children would have provided another line of possible successors
the implication of agrippinas request was that she needed a man from outside the imperial family to serve as protector and step father of possible imperial heirs a powerful position
it was also an implied reprimand tiberius was meant to be the guardian of the imperial family
tiberius was in a tough position
he was faced with a conflict between his family and his friend
his solution was surprising
in ad he left rome altogether and retired to the island of capri in the bay of naples
he cut himself off from the factions altogether and abandoned politics
he left rome in the care of sejanus
this allowed sejanus to freely attack his rivals
with tiberius away from rome the city would see a rise of politically motivated trials on the part of sejanus and his supporters against agrippina and her associates
many of her friends and associates were subsequently accused of maiestas by the growing number of accusers
it was also common to see charges of sexual misconduct and corruption
in ad agrippina found herself placed under house arrest in her suburban villa outside herculaneum
in ad the senate voted that altars to clementia and amicitia be raised
at that time clementia was considered a virtue of the ruling class for only the powerful could give clemency
the altar of amicitia was flanked by statues of sejanus and tiberius
by this time his association with tiberius was such that there were those in roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor
sejanus birthday was honored as if he were a member of the imperial family
according to richard alston sejanus association with tiberius must have at least indicated to the people that he would be further elevated
sejanus did not begin his final attack on agrippina until after the death of livia in ad
tacitus reports a letter being sent to the senate from tiberius denouncing agrippina for her arrogance and prideful attitude and nero for engaging in shameful sexual activities
the senate would not begin these highly unpopular prosecutions against her or her son until it received clear instructions from tiberius to do so
despite public outcry agrippina and nero were declared public enemies following a repeat of the accusations by the emperor
they were both exiled nero to pontia where he was killed or encouraged to commit suicide in ad and agrippina to the island of pandateria
suetonius says that while on the island of pandateria she lost an eye when she was beaten by a centurion
she would remain on the island until her death in ad
accounts of her death vary
she is said to have died from starvation but it is not certain whether or not it was self imposed
tacitus says food was withheld from her in an effort to make her death seem like a suicide
her son drusus was later also exiled on charges of sexual misdemeanors
sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in october ad just after the death of nero the exact cause for which remains unclear
alston suggests that sejanus may have been acting in tiberius favor to remove germanicus family from power noting that agrippina and neros brother drusus were left in exile even after sejanus death
the deaths of agrippinas older sons elevated her youngest son caligula to the position of successor and he became princeps when tiberius died in ad
drusus the youngers son tiberius gemellus was summoned to capri by his grandfather tiberius where he and caligula were made joint heirs
when caligula assumed power he made gemellus his adopted son but caligula soon had gemellus killed for plotting against him
according to philo caligulas pretended reason was a conspiracy
after he became emperor caligula took on the role of a dutiful son and brother in a public show of pietas
he went out to the islands of pontia and pandateria in order to recover the remains of agrippina and nero
it was not easy to recover neros bones as they were scattered and buried
moreover he had a stormy passage however the difficulty in his task made his devotion seem even greater
the ashes were brought to ostia from where they were carried up the tiber and brought to the campus martius from where equestrians placed them on briers to join the ashes of germanicus in the mausoleum of augustus
the move was reminiscent of when agrippina carried the ashes of her husband just over years earlier
agrippinas funerary urn still survives
which translates as bones of agrippina daughter of marcus agrippa granddaughter of divus augustus wife of germanicus caesar mother of princeps gaius caesar germanicus
agrippina was fiercely independent a trait she shared with her mother
dio described her as having ambitions to match her pedigree
however anthony a
barrett notes that agrippina was fully aware that a woman in ancient rome could not hold power in her own right
instead agrippina followed the model of livia in promoting the careers of her children
she and her daughter agrippina the younger are both described as being equally ambitious for their sons
whereas the elder agrippinas son failed to become emperor the younger agrippinas son also named nero succeeds
in a contrast tacitus has agrippina the elder merely standing on a bridge waving the soldiers passing by whereas her daughter eclipses her by presiding over a military tribunal and accepting gifts from foreign ambassadors
tacitus also records serious tension between agrippina and livia
he describes livia as having visited stepmotherly provocations on agrippina
he says of agrippina were it not that through her moral integrity and love for her husband she converted an otherwise ungovernable temper to the good
despite being sympathetic to her as a victim of imperial oppression he uses expressions like excitable arrogant proud fierce obstinate and ambitious to describe agrippina
his comments are echoed by other sources
historian lindsay powell says agrippina enjoyed a normal marriage and continued to show her devotion to germanicus after his death
he says she was regarded by the roman people as quoting tacitus the glory of the country the sole surviving offspring of augustus the solitary example of the good old times
alston cautions against accepting the stories of agrippinas feud with sejanus at face value as these accounts reflect a tradition hostile to tiberius and sejanus
they may have been circulated by agrippinas supporters or they may have emerged after sejanus fall in ad
he adds these stories are plausible though not certain to be true
augustus was proud of agrippina
suetonius claims that augustus wrote her a letter praising her intellect and directing her education
suetonius also records that augustus who held strict views on self restraint and respectable speech cautioned agrippina not to speak offensively
when she next appears she is being chastised by tiberius in greek for making irritating remarks and the tone of the greek verse quoted by tiberius suggests that she should have heeded the advice of her grandfather not to speak offensively
the annals of tacitus is a history of the julio claudian dynasty beginning with the death of augustus
in it he portrays women as having a profound influence on politics
the women of the imperial family in particular are depicted by tacitus as having a notable prominence in the public sphere as well as possessing a ferocity and ambition with which they pursue it
tacitus presents them as living longer than the imperial men and thus being more wise as they advance in age
among the most broad of his portrayals is that of agrippina
he emphasizes their role in connecting genetically back to augustus a significant factor in the marriages of the emperors and princes of the dynasty
the annals repeatedly has agrippina competing for influence with tiberius simply because she is related to augustus biologically
tacitus presents agrippina as being kindred to aristocratic males and has her reversing gender roles which showcases her assumption of male auctoritas with metaphors of her dressing and undressing
in an example of agrippina assuming auctoritas he says using the above epithet ingens animi he assigns a haughty attitude to agrippina that compels her to explore the affairs of men
he records her as having reversed the natural order of things when she quelled the mutiny of the rhine in ad
in so doing he describes her as having usurped her husbands power a power rightfully belonging only to a general
portraits of roman women from the julio claudian dynasty display a freer hair treatment than those of traditional roman men and are more keen on the sensitivity of recording on different textures
these changes in style served to make reproducing them more popular in the mid first century ad
reproductions of her image would continue to be made into that period
in the portrait she is given a youthful face despite the fact that she lived to middle age
agrippinas hair is a mass of curls that covers both sides of her head and is long going down to her shoulders
her portraiture can be contrasted with that of livia who had a more austere augustan hairstyle
there are three different periods during the first century ad when portraits were created for agrippina at the time of her marriage to germanicus when her son caligula came into power in ad and collected her ashes from the island of pandateria for relocation to the mausoleum of augustus and at the time of claudius marriage to agrippina the younger who wanted to connect himself to the lineage of augustus by evoking agrippinas image
coins and inscriptions cannot act as a method of discerning her age because her hairstyle remains unchanged in all the representations
the easiest phase of portraits to identify are those dating to the time of caligula when a fair abundance of coins were minted with an image of his mother on them
it is a posthumous portrait of her with idealized features
in the phase following claudius marriage her features are made to more closely resemble those of her daughter
the goal was to strengthen agrippina the youngers connection with her mother
finally the portraits of her dating to the time of tiberius are still idealized but not as much as those from the period of caligulas reign
images of agrippina from this period are the most lifelike
agrippina is one of the few women from the roman imperial period whose story was recounted in later centuries as an example of moral character
her journey to deposit the ashes of her husband was popular with eighteenth century painters including william turner gavin hamilton and benjamin west whose painting agrippina landing at brundisium with the ashes of germanicus began the trend
she is also remembered in de mulieribus claris a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the florentine author giovanni boccaccio composed in
it is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in western literature
other notable works of which include julia agrippina also referred to as agrippina the younger was roman empress from ad to the fourth wife and niece of emperor claudius and the mother of nero
agrippina was one of the most prominent women in the julio claudian dynasty
she was the great granddaughter of augustus and the daughter of the roman general germanicus and agrippina the elder
her father germanicus was the nephew and heir apparent of the second emperor tiberius
agrippinas brother caligula became emperor in ad
after caligula was assassinated in ad germanicus brother claudius took the throne
agrippina married claudius in ad
agrippina has been described by modern and ancient sources as a ruthless ambitious and domineering woman who used her powerful political ties to influence the affairs of the roman state even managing to successfully maneuver her son nero into the line of succession
claudius eventually became aware of her plotting but died in ad under suspicious circumstances potentially poisoned by agrippina herself
she exerted significant political influence in the early years of her sons reign but eventually fell out of favor with him and was killed in ad
physically agrippina was described as a beautiful and reputable woman and according to pliny the elder had a double canine in her upper right jaw which was regarded as a sign of good fortune in ancient rome
agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of agrippina the elder and germanicus
she had three elder brothers nero caesar drusus caesar and the future emperor caligula and two younger sisters julia drusilla and julia livilla
agrippinas two eldest brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the praetorian prefect lucius aelius sejanus
she was the namesake of her mother
agrippina the elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron who was the second daughter and fourth child of julia the elder and the statesman marcus vipsanius agrippa
the father of julia the elder was the emperor augustus and julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to scribonia who had close blood relations with pompey the great and lucius cornelius sulla
germanicus agrippinas father was a very popular general and politician
his mother was antonia minor and his father was the general nero claudius drusus
he was antonia minors first child
germanicus had two younger siblings livilla and claudius making the pair agrippinas aunt and uncle respectively
not only would claudius later serve as roman emperor he would also go on to take agrippina his own niece to wife
antonia minor was a daughter to octavia the younger by her second marriage to triumvir mark antony and octavia was the second eldest sister and full blooded sister of augustus
germanicus father drusus the elder was the second son of the empress livia drusilla by her first marriage to praetor tiberius nero and was the emperor tiberiuss younger brother and augustuss stepson
in the year ad augustus ordered and forced tiberius to adopt germanicus who happened to be tiberiuss nephew as his son and heir
germanicus was a favourite of his great uncle augustus who hoped that germanicus would succeed his uncle tiberius who was augustuss own adopted son and heir
this in turn meant that tiberius was also agrippinas adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great uncle
agrippina was born on november in ad or possibly at oppidum ubiorum a roman outpost on the rhine river located in present day cologne germany
a second sister julia drusilla was born on september ad also in germany
agrippinas place of birth is disputed with cologne being seen as a likely place considering how agrippina would favor the city and the colonia claudia ara agrippinensium being established at her prompting there
suetonius however claims both of germanicus eldest daughters having been born in gaul more specifically trier
as a small child agrippina travelled with her parents throughout germany until she and her siblings returned to rome to live with and be raised by their paternal grandmother antonia
her parents departed for syria in ad to conduct official duties and according to tacitus the third and youngest sister was born en route on the island of lesbos namely julia livilla probably on march
in october of ad germanicus died suddenly in antioch
germanicus death caused much public grief in rome and gave rise to rumours that he had been murdered by gnaeus calpurnius piso and munatia plancina on the orders of tiberius as his widow agrippina the elder returned to rome with his ashes
agrippina the younger was thereafter supervised by her mother her paternal grandmother antonia minor and her great grandmother livia all of them notable influential and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive
she lived on the palatine hill in rome
her great uncle tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of augustus in ad
after her thirteenth birthday in ad tiberius arranged for agrippina to marry her paternal first cousin once removed gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in rome
domitius came from a distinguished family of consular rank
through his mother antonia major domitius was a great nephew of augustus first cousin to claudius and first cousin once removed to agrippina and caligula
he had two sisters domitia lepida the elder and domitia lepida the younger
domitia lepida the younger was the mother of the empress valeria messalina
antonia major was the elder sister to antonia minor and the first daughter of octavia minor and mark antony
domitius who was according to suetonius in every aspect of his life detestable served as consul in ad
agrippina and domitius lived between antium and rome
not much is known about the relationship between them
tiberius died on march ad and agrippinas only surviving brother caligula became the new emperor
being the emperors sister gave agrippina some influence
agrippina and her younger sisters julia drusilla and julia livilla received various honours from their brother which included but were not limited to around the time that tiberius died agrippina had become pregnant
domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child
on december ad in the early morning in antium agrippina gave birth to a son
agrippina and domitius named their son lucius domitius ahenobarbus after domitius recently deceased father
this child would grow up to become the emperor nero
nero was agrippinas only natural child
suetonius states that domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son whereupon he replied i dont think anything produced by me and agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people
caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships
on june ad drusilla died possibly of a fever rampant in rome at the time
caligula was particularly fond of drusilla claiming to treat her as he would his own wife even though drusilla had a husband
following her death caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane
in ad agrippina and livilla with their maternal cousin drusillas widower marcus aemilius lepidus were involved in a failed plot to murder caligula a plot known as the plot of the three daggers which was to make lepidus the new emperor
lepidus agrippina and livilla were accused of being lovers
not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it
at the trial of lepidus caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him
the three were found guilty as accessories to the crime
lepidus was executed
according to the fragmentary inscriptions of the arval brethren agrippina was forced to carry the urn of lepidus ashes back to rome
agrippina and livilla were exiled by their brother to the ponza in pontine islands an archipelago of small volcanic islands about miles away from rome
caligula sold their furniture jewellery slaves and freedmen
in january of ad domitius died of edema at pyrgi
lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt domitia lepida the younger after caligula had taken his inheritance away from him
caligula his wife milonia caesonia and their daughter julia drusilla were murdered on january ad
agrippinas paternal uncle claudius brother of her father germanicus became the new roman emperor
claudius lifted the exiles of agrippina and livilla
livilla returned to her husband while agrippina was reunited with her estranged son
after the death of her first husband agrippina tried to make shameless advances on the future emperor galba
he showed no interest being devoted to his wife aemilia lepida
on one occasion galbas mother in law gave agrippina a public reprimand and a slap in the face before a whole bevy of married women
claudius had lucius inheritance reinstated
lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after gaius sallustius crispus passienus divorced lucius aunt domitia lepida the elder so that crispus could marry agrippina
they married and crispus became a step father to lucius
crispus was an influential wealthy and powerful man who served twice as consul
he was the adopted grandson and biological great great nephew of the historian sallust
little is known about their relationship but crispus soon died and left his estate to nero
during the first years his reign claudius was married to the infamous empress valeria messalina
messalina was agrippinas paternal second cousin
among the victims of messalinas intrigues were agrippinas surviving sister livilla who was charged with adultery with seneca the younger
although agrippina was very influential at this time she kept a low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor
messalina considered agrippinas son a threat to her sons position and sent assassins to strangle lucius during his siesta
the assassins left after they saw a snake beneath lucius pillow considering it a bad omen
it was however only a sloughed off snake skin
by agrippinas order the serpents skin was enclosed in a bracelet that the young lucius wore on his right arm
in ad crispus died
at his funeral a rumour spread that agrippina had poisoned crispus to gain his estate
after being widowed a second time agrippina was left very wealthy
later that year messalina and britannicus attended the performance of the troy pageant at the secular games where agrippina was also present with lucius
agrippina and lucius received greater applause from the audience than messalina and britannicus did
many people began to show pity and sympathy to agrippina due to the unfortunate circumstances of her life
messalina was executed in ad for conspiring with gaius silius to overthrow her husband
around this time agrippina became the mistress to one of claudius advisers the greek freedman marcus antonius pallas
after ending his marriage claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time and his advisers began discussing which noblewoman he should marry
claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded but more recently it has been suggested that the senate may have pushed for the marriage between agrippina and claudius to end the feud between the julian and claudian branches
this feud dated back to agrippinas mothers actions against tiberius after the death of germanicus
claudius made references to her in his speeches my daughter and foster child born and bred in my lap so to speak
when claudius decided to marry her he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest
in roman society an uncle marrying his niece was considered incestuous and immoral
agrippina and claudius married on new years day in ad and the marriage was met with widespread disapproval
agrippinas marriage to claudius was not based on love but power possibly being a part of her plan to make her son lucius the new emperor
shortly after marrying claudius agrippina eliminated her rival lollia paulina by persuading claudius to charge paulina with allegations of black magic use
claudius stipulated that paulina did not receive a hearing and her property was confiscated
she left italy but agrippina was unsatisfied
allegedly on agrippinas orders paulina committed suicide
in the months leading up to her marriage to claudius agrippinas maternal second cousin the praetor lucius junius silanus torquatus was betrothed to claudius daughter claudia octavia
this betrothal was broken off in ad when agrippina scheming with the consul lucius vitellius the elder the father of the future emperor aulus vitellius falsely accused silanus of incest with his sister junia calvina
agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between octavia and her son
consequently claudius broke off the engagement and forced silanus to resign from public office
silanus committed suicide on the day that agrippina married her uncle and calvina was exiled from italy in early ad
calvina was called back from exile after the death of agrippina
towards the end of ad agrippina would order the murder of silanus eldest brother marcus junius silanus torquatus without neros knowledge so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brothers death
agrippina became empress in ad upon marrying her uncle claudius
she also became stepmother to claudia antonia claudius daughter and only child from his second marriage to aelia paetina and to the young claudia octavia and britannicus claudius children with valeria messalina
agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court whom she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late messalina
she also eliminated or removed anyone whom she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son one of her victims being lucius second paternal aunt and messalinas mother domitia lepida the younger
griffin describes how agrippina had achieved this dominant position for her son and herself by a web of political alliances which included claudius chief secretary and bookkeeper pallas his doctor xenophon and afranius burrus the head of the praetorian guard who owed his promotion to agrippina
neither ancient nor modern historians of rome have doubted that agrippina had her eye on securing the throne for nero from the very day of the marriage if not earlier
dio cassius observation seems to bear that out as soon as agrippina had come to live in the palace she gained complete control over claudius
in ad agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the celtic king caratacus bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor
in ad agrippina was granted the honorific title of augusta
she was third roman woman and only the second living roman woman to receive this title
in her capacity as augusta agrippina quickly became a trusted advisor to claudius and by ad she exerted a considerable influence over the decisions of the emperor
statues of her were erected in many cities across the empire and her face appeared on coins
in the senate her followers were advanced with public offices and governorships
she would often to a place outside the imperial court and listened to the senate from behind the scenes and claudius even allowed her to be a separate court and decide on empire matters
agrippina even signed government documents and officially dealt with foreign ambassadors
she also claimed auctoritas and autokrateira in front of the senate the people and the army
however this privileged position caused resentment among the senatorial class and the imperial family
also that year claudius founded a roman colony and called the colony colonia claudia ara agrippinensis or agrippinensium today known as cologne after agrippina who was born there
this was the only roman colony to be named after a roman woman
in ad she was given a carpentum a ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests such as the vestal virgins and sacred statues
that same year she appointed sextus afranius burrus as the head of the praetorian guard replacing the previous head of the praetorian guard rufrius crispinus
she assisted claudius in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful
ancient sources claim that agrippina successfully influenced claudius into adopting her son and making him his successor
lucius domitius ahenobarbus was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather in ad
lucius name was changed to nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus and he became claudiuss adopted son heir and recognized successor
agrippina and claudius betrothed nero to his step sister claudia octavia and agrippina arranged to have seneca the younger return from exile to tutor the future emperor
claudius chose to adopt nero because of his julian and claudian lineage
agrippina deprived britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible
for instance in ad agrippina ordered the execution of britannicus tutor sosibius
sosibus had confronted her outraged by claudius adoption of nero and his choice of nero as successor over his own son britannicus
nero and octavia were married on june ad
claudius later regretted marrying agrippina and adopting nero and began to favor britannicus preparing him for the throne
these actions gave agrippina a motive to allegedly eliminate claudius
ancient sources say she poisoned claudius on october ad with a plate of deadly mushrooms at a banquet thus enabling nero to quickly take the throne as emperor
accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources it is possible that claudius died of natural causes being years old
in the aftermath of claudiuss death agrippina who initially kept the death secret tried to consolidate power by immediately ordering that the palace and the capital be sealed
after all the gates were blockaded and exit of the capital forbidden she introduced nero first to the soldiers and then to the senators as emperor
nero was raised to emperor and agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified claudius
she now attempted to use her sons youth to participate in the rule of the roman empire
she enjoyed imperial prerogatives holding court with the emperor by her side being allowed to visit senate meetings from behind a curtain and appearing as a partner to her son in the royal coins and statues
the historian tacitus depicts her as attempting a diarchy with her son when she demanded that the praetorian guard pledge their loyalty to her
she was also said to have tried to participate in her sons meeting with armenian ambassadors until seneca and burrus stopped her
in year one of neros reign agrippina began losing influence over nero when he began to have an affair with the freed woman claudia acte which agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for
agrippina began to support britannicus in her possible attempt to make him emperor or to threaten nero
the panicking emperor decided on whether to eliminate his mother or his step brother
soon nero had britannicus secretly poisoned during his own banquet in february ad
the power struggle between agrippina and her son had begun
between ad and agrippina became very watchful and critical of her son
in ad agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in the imperial residence
however agrippina retained some degree of influence over her son for several more years and they are considered the best years of neros reign
but as their relationship grew more hostile nero gradually began to deprive his mother of honours and power and even removed her roman and german bodyguards
nero even threatened his mother that he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the greek island of rhodes a place where tiberius had lived after divorcing julia the elder
pallas also was dismissed from the court
the fall of pallas and the opposition of burrus and seneca to agrippina contributed to her scaling down of authority
in mid ad she was forced out of everyday and active participation in the governance of rome
while agrippina lived in her residence or when she went on short visits to rome nero sent people to annoy her
although living in misenum she was always hailed as augusta and agrippina and nero would see each other on short visits
in late ad agrippina and a group of soldiers and senators were accused of attempting to overthrow nero and it was said they planned to move with gaius rubellius plautus
in addition she revealed neros relationship with poppaea sabina
the circumstances that surround agrippinas death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti nero bias
all surviving stories of agrippinas death contradict themselves and each other and are generally fantastical
according to tacitus in ad nero became involved with the noble woman poppaea sabina
she taunted him for being a mummys boy
she also convinced him of the autonomy of any other emperor
with the reasoning that a divorce from octavia and a marriage to poppaea was not politically feasible with agrippina alive nero decided to kill agrippina
yet nero did not marry poppaea until ad calling into question this motive
additionally suetonius reveals that poppaeas husband otho was not sent away by nero until after agrippinas death in ad making it highly unlikely that already married poppaea would be pressing nero
some modern historians theorise that neros decision to kill agrippina was prompted by her plot to replace him with either gaius rubellius plautus or britannicus
tacitus claims that nero considered poisoning or stabbing her but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious so he settled on after the advice of his former tutor anicetus building a self sinking boat
though aware of the plot agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a couch breaking the ceilings fall
though the collapsing ceiling missed agrippina it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm
the boat failed to sink as a result of the collapse of the lead ceiling so the crew then sank the boat but agrippina swam to shore
her friend acerronia polla was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned since she was exclaiming that she was agrippina in the hope of being saved
she did not know however that this was an assassination attempt not a mere accident
agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers
news of agrippinas survival reached nero so he sent anicetus the trierach herculeius and the marine centurion obaritus as well as an armed and menacing column to kill her
after surrounding the villa they eventually made their way to the bedroom
after the last maid departed her side agrippina was surrounded in her bed and struck in the head with a cudgel before proffering her womb crying out stab my belly and finally dying after experiencing many fatal wounds to that area
this narrative is clearly presented similarly to that of julius caesar and her last act being to ensure violence upon her womb implies it was a symbolic act against her wombs only progeny the man who had ordered her death
suetonius says that agrippinas over watchful and over critical eye that she kept over nero drove him to murdering her
after months of attempting to humiliate her by depriving her of her power honour and bodyguards he also expelled her from the palatine followed by the people he sent to pester her with lawsuits and jeers and catcalls
when he eventually turned to murder he first tried poison three times in fact
she prevented her death by taking the antidote in advance
afterwards he rigged up a machine in her room which would drop her ceiling tiles onto her as she slept but she once again escaped death after she received word of the plan
neros final plan was to get her in a boat which would collapse and sink
he sent her a friendly letter asking to reconcile and inviting her to celebrate the quinquatrus at baiae with him
he arranged an accidental collision between her galley and one of his captains
when returning home he offered her his collapsible boat as opposed to her damaged galley
the day after the boat sank nero received word of her survival from her freedman agermus
panicking nero ordered a guard to surreptitiously drop a blade behind agermus and nero immediately had him arrested on a charge of attempted murder
nero ordered the assassination of agrippina
he made it look as if agrippina had committed suicide after her plot to kill nero had been uncovered
suetonius says that after agrippinas death nero examined agrippinas corpse and discussed her good and bad points
nero also believed agrippina would haunt him after her death
the tale of cassius dio is also somewhat different
it starts again with poppaea as the motive behind the murder
nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea
agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up she fell into the water
agrippina swam to shore so nero sent an assassin to kill her
nero then claimed agrippina had plotted to kill him and committed suicide
her reputed last words uttered as the assassin was about to strike were smite my womb the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so abominable a son
after agrippinas death nero viewed her corpse and according to some commented how beautiful she was
her body was cremated that night on a dining couch
at his mothers funeral nero was witless speechless and rather scared
when the news spread that agrippina had died the roman army senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mothers plots
during the remainder of neros reign agrippinas grave was not covered or enclosed
her household later on gave her a modest tomb in misenum
nero would have his mothers death on his conscience
he felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares of her even seeing his mothers ghost and getting persian magicians to ask her for forgiveness
years before she died agrippina had visited astrologers to ask about her sons future
the astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her
she replied let him kill me provided he becomes emperor according to tacitus
agrippina left memoirs of her life and the misfortunes of her family which tacitus used when writing his annals but they have not survived
she is remembered in de mulieribus claris a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the florentine author giovanni boccaccio composed in
it is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in western literature
most ancient roman sources are quite critical of agrippina the younger
tacitus considered her vicious and had a strong disposition against her
other sources are suetonius and cassius dio
american chinese cuisine is a cuisine derived from chinese cuisine that was developed by chinese americans
the dishes served in many north american chinese restaurants are adapted to american tastes and often differ significantly from those found in china
chinese immigrants arrived in the united states seeking employment as miners and railroad workers
as larger groups arrived laws were put in place preventing them from owning land
they mostly lived together in ghettos individually referred to as chinatown
here the immigrants started their small businesses including restaurants and laundry services
early american chinese food tended to be homogeneous needing to adapt to local ingredients and catering to an americanized taste
it was like if all the americans in china were from a small town miles outside of los angeles
very underrepresented
by the th century the chinese community in san francisco operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronized mainly by chinese
the restaurants in smaller towns served food based on what their customers requested anything ranging from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie to beans and eggs
many of these small town restaurant owners were self taught family cooks who improvised on different cooking methods using whatever ingredients were available
these smaller restaurants were responsible for developing american chinese cuisine where the food was modified to suit a more american palate
first catering to miners and railroad workers they established new eateries in towns where chinese food was completely unknown adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers tastes
even though the new flavors and dishes meant they were not strictly chinese cuisine these chinese restaurants have been cultural ambassadors to americans
chinese restaurants in the united states began during the california gold rush which brought immigrants across from the canton region of china
the first chinese restaurant in america is debated
some say it was macau and woosung while others cite canton restaurant
both unphotographed establishments were founded in in san francisco
either way these and other such restaurants were central features in the daily lives of immigrants
they provided a connection to home particularly for the many bachelors who did not have the resources or knowledge to cook for themselves
in the ratio of male to female chinese immigrants was a
these restaurants served as gathering places and cultural centers for the chinese community
by there were five chinese restaurants in san francisco
soon after significant amounts of food were being imported from china to americas west coast
the trend spread steadily eastward with the growth of the american railways particularly to new york city
the chinese exclusion act allowed merchants to enter the country and in restaurant owners became eligible for merchant visas
this fueled the opening of chinese restaurants as an immigration vehicle
pekin noodle parlor established in is the oldest operating chinese restaurant in the country
the united states had chinese restaurants
along the way cooks adapted southern chinese dishes and developed a style of chinese food not found in china such as chop suey
restaurants provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by ethnic discrimination or lack of language fluency
by the s this cuisine particularly chop suey became popular among middle class americans
however after world war ii it began to be dismissed for not being authentic though it continued to be popular
in the republic of china evacuated the dachen islands in the face of the encroaching communists
many who evacuated to taiwan later moved to the united states as they lacked strong social networks and access to opportunity in taiwan
chefs from the dachen islands had a strong influence on american chinese food
beginning in the s taiwanese immigrants replaced cantonese immigrants as the primary labor force in american chinese restaurants
these immigrants expanded american chinese cuisine beyond cantonese cuisine to encompass dishes from many different regions of china as well as japanese inspired dishes
chinese american restaurants played a key role in ushering in the era of take out and delivery food in the united states
in new york city delivery was pioneered in the s by empire szechuan gourmet franchise which hired taiwanese students studying at columbia university to do the work
chinese american restaurants were among the first restaurants to use picture menus in the us
taiwanese immigration largely ended in the s due to an economic boom and democratization in taiwan
from the s onward immigrants from china once again made up the majority of cooks in american chinese restaurants
there has been a consequential component of chinese emigration of illegal origin most notably fuzhou people from fujian and wenzhounese from zhejiang in mainland china specifically destined to work in chinese restaurants in new york city beginning in the s
adapting chinese cooking techniques to local produce and tastes has led to the development of american chinese cuisine
many of the chinese restaurant menus in the us are printed in chinatown manhattanwhich has a strong chinese american demographic
late th century tastes have been more accommodating to the local residents
by this time it had become evident that chinese restaurants no longer catered mainly to chinese customers
in the smithsonian national museum of american history displayed some of the historical background and cultural artifacts of american chinese cuisine in its exhibit entitled sweet sour a look at the history of chinese food in the united states
a lot of the foods that americans call chinese food were created in america including fortune cookies crab rangoon and general tsos chicken
american chinese food builds from styles and food habits brought from the southern province of guangdong often from the toisan district of toisan the origin of most chinese immigration before the closure of immigration from china in
these chinese families developed new styles and used readily available ingredients especially in california
the type of chinese american cooking served in restaurants was different from the foods eaten in chinese american homes
of the various regional cuisines in china cantonese cuisine has been the most influential in the development of american chinese food
american chinese food typically features different types and greater quantities of meat than traditional chinese cuisine
another major difference between chinese and american chinese cuisine is in the use of vegetables
salads containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional chinese cuisine
an increasing number of american chinese restaurants including some upscale establishments have started to offer these items in response to customer demand
while cuisine in china makes frequent use of asian leaf vegetables like bok choy and gai lan american chinese cuisine makes use of some ingredients not native to and very rarely used in china for example western broccoli instead of chinese broccoli
in order to distinguish the two
chinese ingredients considered exotic in north america have become more available over time including fresh fruits and vegetables which previously had been rare
for example edible snow pea pods have become widely available while the less known dau miu are also appearing on menus and even in supermarkets in north america
american chinese food also has had a reputation for high levels of msg to enhance flavor
in recent years market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer msg free or no msg menus or to omit this ingredient on request
egg fried rice in american chinese cuisine is also prepared differently with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce
some food styles such as dim sum were also modified to fit american palates such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce
both chinese and american chinese cooking utilize similar methods of preparation such as stir frying pan frying and deep frying which are all easily done using a wok
ming tsai the owner of the blue ginger restaurant in wellesley massachusetts and host of pbs culinary show simply ming said that american chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing regions of china at one time have chop suey or have fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce eight different sweet and sour dishes or a whole page of different chow meins or fried rice dishes
tsai said chinese american cuisine is dumbed down chinese food
its adapted
to be blander thicker and sweeter for the american public
most american chinese establishments cater to non chinese customers with menus written in english or containing pictures
if separate chinese language menus are available they typically feature items such as liver chicken feet or other meat dishes that might deter american customers
in chinatown manhattan some restaurants are known for having a phantom menu with food preferred by ethnic chinese but believed to be disliked by non chinese americans
dau miu is a chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early s and now not only appears on english language menus usually as pea shoots but is often served by upscale non asian restaurants as well
originally it was only available during a few months of the year but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year round
the new york metropolitan area is home to the largest chinese population outside of asia which also constitutes the largest metropolitan asian american group in the united states and the largest asian national metropolitan diaspora in the western hemisphere
the chinese american population of the new york city metropolitan area was an estimated as of
given the new york metropolitan areas continuing status as by far the leading gateway for chinese immigrants to the united states all popular styles of every chinese regional cuisine have commensurately become ubiquitously accessible in new york city including hakka taiwanese shanghainese hunanese szechuan cantonese fujianese xinjiang zhejiang and korean chinese cuisine
even the relatively obscure dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to northeast china is now available in flushing queens as well as mongolian cuisine and uyghur cuisine
kosher preparation of chinese food is also widely available in new york city given the metropolitan areas large jewish and particularly orthodox jewish populations
the perception that american jews eat at chinese restaurants on christmas day is documented in media
the tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on christmas day the close proximity of jewish and chinese immigrants to each other in new york city and the absence of dairy foods combined with meat
kosher chinese food is usually prepared in new york city as well as in other large cities with orthodox jewish neighborhoods under strict rabbinical supervision as a prerequisite for kosher certification
chinese populations in los angeles represent at least of the provincial level administrative units of china along with the largest population of taiwanese born immigrants outside of taiwan making greater los angeles home to a diverse population of chinese people in the united states
chinese american cuisine in the greater los angeles area is concentrated in chinese ethnoburbs rather than traditional chinatowns
the oldest chinese ethnoburb is monterey park considered to be the nations first suburban chinatown
although chinatown in los angeles is still a significant commercial center for chinese immigrants the majority are centered in the san gabriel valley which is the one of the largest concentration of asian americans in the country stretching from monterey park into the cities of alhambra san gabriel rosemead san marino south pasadena west covina walnut city of industry diamond bar arcadia and temple city
the valley boulevard corridor is the main artery of chinese restaurants in the san gabriel valley
another hub with a significant chinese population is irvine
more than chinese americans live in the san gabriel valley alone with over being foreign born
the valley has become a brand name tourist destination in china although droughts in california are creating a difficult impact upon its water security and existential viability
of the ten cities in the united states with the highest proportions of chinese americans the top eight are located in the san gabriel valley making it one of the largest concentrated hubs for chinese americans in north america
some regional styles of chinese cuisine include beijing chengdu chongqing dalian hangzhou hong kong hunan mongolian hot pot nanjing shanghai shanxi shenyang wuxi xinjiang yunnan and wuhan
since the early s many american chinese restaurants influenced by california cuisine have opened in the san francisco bay area
the trademark dishes of american chinese cuisine remain on the menu but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables and the selection is vegetarian friendly
this new cuisine has exotic ingredients like mangos and portobello mushrooms
brown rice is often offered as an alternative to white rice
some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour tortillas for the rice pancakes in mushu dishes
this occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as california chinese both the more westernized places and the more authentic places
there is a mexican bakery that supplies some restaurants with thinner tortillas made for use with mushu
mushu purists do not always react positively to this trend
in addition many restaurants serving more native style chinese cuisines exist due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic chinese in the san francisco bay area
restaurants specializing in cantonese sichuanese hunanese northern chinese shanghainese taiwanese and hong kong traditions are widely available as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants hong kong style diners and cafes also known as cha chaan teng dim sum teahouses and hot pot restaurants
many chinatown areas also feature chinese bakeries boba milk tea shops roasted meat vegetarian cuisine and specialized dessert shops
chop suey is not widely available in san francisco and the areas chow mein is different from midwestern chow mein
chinese cuisine in boston results from a combination of economic and regional factors in association with the wide chinese academic scene
the growing boston chinatown accommodates chinese owned bus lines shuttling an increasing number of passengers to and from the numerous chinatowns in new york city and this has led to some exchange between boston chinese cuisine and that in new york
a large immigrant fujianese immigrant population has made a home in boston leading to fuzhou cuisine being readily available there
an increasing vietnamese population has also had an influence on chinese cuisine in greater boston
in addition innovative dishes incorporating chow mein and chop suey as well as locally farmed produce and regionally procured seafood are found in chinese as well as non chinese food in and around boston
the selection of chinese bakery products has increased markedly in the st century although the range of choices in new york city remains supreme
joyce chen introduced northern chinese and shanghainese dishes to boston in the s including peking duck moo shu pork hot and sour soup and potstickers which she called peking ravioli or ravs
her restaurants were frequented by early pioneers of the arpanet as well as celebrities such as john kenneth galbraith james beard julia child henry kissinger beverly sills and danny kaye
a former harvard university president called her eating establishment not merely a restaurant but a cultural exchange center
in addition her single season pbs national television series joyce chen cooks popularized some dishes which could be made at home and she often encouraged using substitute ingredients when necessary
the evolving american chinese cuisine scene in philadelphia has similarities with the situation in both new york city and boston
as with boston philadelphia is experiencing significant chinese immigration from new york city to the north and from china the top country of birth by a significant margin for a new arrivals there
there is a growing fujianese community in philadelphia as well and fuzhou cuisine is readily available in the philadelphia chinatown
also emerging vietnamese cuisine in philadelphia is contributing to evolution in local chinese cuisine with some chinese american restaurants adopting vietnamese influences or recipes
although washington dcs chinese community has not achieved as high of a local profile as that in other major cities along the mid atlantic united states it is now growing and rapidly so due to the gentrification of dcs chinatown and the status of washington dc as the capital of the united states
the growing chinese community in dc and its suburbs has revitalized the influence of chinese cuisine in the area
washington dcs population is chinese making them the largest single asian ancestry in the city
however the chinese community in the dc area is no longer solely concentrated in the chinatown which is about chinese and asian but is mostly concentrated throughout various towns in suburban maryland and northern virginia
the largest concentration of chinese and taiwanese in the dc area is in rockville maryland in montgomery county
a popular dish localized in chinese american carryouts across the dmv region consists of whole fried chicken wings served with mumbo sauce a sweet tangy ketchup based condiment
in dc proper there are chinese owned restaurants specializing in both chinese american and authentic chinese cuisine
regional variations of chinese cuisine that restaurants in dc specialize in include shanghainese cuisine cantonese cuisine uyghur cuisine mongolian cuisine and sichuan cuisine
in the suburbs of dc in maryland and virginia many of which have a much higher chinese population than dc regional variations present aside from the ones previously mentioned include hong kong cuisine hunan cuisine shaanxi cuisine taiwanese cuisine and yunnan cuisine
hawaiian chinese food developed somewhat differently from chinese cuisine in the continental united states
owing to the diversity of pacific ethnicities in hawaii and the history of the chinese influence in hawaii resident chinese cuisine forms a component of the cuisine of hawaii which is a fusion of different culinary traditions
some chinese dishes are typically served as part of plate lunches in hawaii
the names of foods are different as well such as manapua from the hawaiian contraction of mea ono puaa or delicious pork item from the dim sum bao though the meat is not necessarily pork
many american films involve scenes where chinese take out food is eaten from oyster pails
a consistent choice of cuisine in all these cases however might just be an indicator of its popularity
a running gag in dallas is cliff barnes fondness for inexpensive chinese take out food as opposed to his nemesis j
ewing frequenting fine restaurants
among the numerous american television series and films that feature chinese restaurants as a setting include a christmas story seinfeld sex and the city big trouble in little china south park year of the dragon lethal weapon mickey blue eyes booty call rush hour and men in black
in most cases it is not an actual restaurant but a movie set that typifies the stereotypical american chinese eatery featuring paper lanterns and intricate woodwork with numerous fish tanks and detailed wallpaper alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of sappho and since both poets composed for the entertainment of mytilenean friends they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis such as at the kallisteia an annual festival celebrating the islands federation under mytilene held at the messon where sappho performed publicly with female choirs
alcaeus reference to sappho in terms more typical of a divinity as holy pure honey smiling sappho may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival
the lesbian or aeolic school of poetry reached in the songs of sappho and alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after wards approached and it was assumed by later greek critics and during the early centuries of the christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers a theme which became a favourite subject in art
the poetic works of alcaeus were collected into ten books with elaborate commentaries by the alexandrian scholars aristophanes of byzantium and aristarchus of samothrace sometime in the rd century bc and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form varying in size from mere phrases such as wine window into a man to entire groups of verses and stanzas such as those quoted below
alexandrian scholars numbered him in their canonic nine
among these pindar was held by many ancient critics to be pre eminent but some gave precedence to alcaeus instead
the canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups with alcaeus sappho and anacreon being monodists or solo singers with the following characteristics the other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses
however this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance
even the private reflections of alcaeus ostensibly sung at dinner parties still retain a public function
the roman poet horace also compared the two describing alcaeus as more full throatedly singing see horaces tribute below
alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own down to earth style and sapphos more celestial qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane each emphasising different elements in that balance
dionysius of halicarnassus exhorts us to observe in alcaeus the sublimity brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power his splendid figures and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs while quintilian after commending alcaeus for his excellence in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals in his language he is concise exalted careful and often like an orator goes on to add but he descended into wantonness and amours though better fitted for higher things
the works of alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres
the greek meter here is relatively simple comprising the greater asclepiad adroitly used to convey for example the rhythm of jostling cups
the language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning comprising an exhortation a rhetorical question and a justifying statement
the meaning is clear and uncomplicated the subject is drawn from personal experience and there is an absence of poetic ornament such as simile or metaphor
like many of his poems it begins with a verb and it includes a proverbial expression though it is possible that he coined it himself
alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm tossed ship of state
the following fragment of a hymn to castor and polydeuces is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyage
the poem was written in sapphic stanzas a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot sappho but in which he too excelled here paraphrased in english to suggest the same rhythms
there were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remain
the far away light is a reference to st
elmos fire an electrical discharge supposed by ancient greek mariners to be an epiphany of the dioscuri but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry
this poem does not begin with a verb but with an adverb but still communicates a sense of action
he probably performed his verses at drinking parties for friends and political allies men for whom loyalty was essential particularly in such troubled times
the roman poet horace modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of alcaeus rendering the lesbian poets verse forms including alcaic and sapphic stanzas into concise latin an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes
in his second book in an ode composed in alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm he imagines meeting alcaeus and sappho in hades the story of alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion
his verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition generations of scribes copying an authors collected works such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of pindars odes but haphazardly in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at oxyrhynchus and other locations in egypt sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively adding little by little to the worlds store of poetic fragments
ancient scholars quoted alcaeus in support of various arguments
thus for example heraclitus the allegorist quoted fr
and part of fr
about ships in a storm in his study on homers use of allegory
the hymn to hermes fr was quoted by hephaestion and both he and libanius the rhetorician quoted the first two lines of fr
celebrating the return from babylon of alcaeus brother
the rest of fr
was paraphrased in prose by the historian geographer strabo
many fragments were supplied in quotes by athenaeus principally on the subject of wine drinking but fr
wine window into a man was quoted much later by the byzantine grammarian john tzetzes
the first modern publication of alcaeus verses appeared in a greek and latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by michael neander published at basle in
this was followed by another edition of the nine poets collected by henricus stephanus and published in paris in
fulvius ursinus compiled a fuller collection of alcaic fragments including a commentary which was published at antwerp in
the first separate edition of alcaeus was by christian david jani and it was published at halle in
the next separate edition was by august matthiae leipzig
some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century
thus for example two separate quotes by athenaeus were united by theodor bergk to form fr
three separate sources were combined to form fr
as mentioned above including a prose paraphrase from strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of otto hoffmann karl otfried mller and franz heinrich ludolf ahrens
the discovery of the oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research
in fact eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri frs
a and most recently s
these fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with educated guesses including for example a brilliant supplement by maurice bowra in fr
a hymn to the dioscuri that includes a description of st
elmos fire in the ships rigging
working with only eight letters bowra conjured up a phrase that develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem describing luminescence running along the forestays
alcamenes was an ancient greek sculptor of lemnos and athens who flourished in the nd half of the th century bc
he was a younger contemporary of phidias and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works among which a hephaestus and an aphrodite of the gardens were conspicuous
pausanias says that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of zeus at olympia but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility
pausanias also refers to a statue of ares by alcamenes that was erected on the athenian agora which some have related to the ares borghese
however the temple of ares to which he refers had only been moved from acharnes and re sited in the agora in augustuss time and statues known to derive from alcamenes statue show the god in a breastplate so the identification of alcamenes ares with the ares borghese is not secure
at pergamum there was discovered in a hellenistic copy of the head of the hermes propylaeus of alcamenes
as however the deity is represented in a neo attic archaistic and conventional character this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of alcamenes who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist
it is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the parthenon in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of phidias
he is said to be the most eminent sculptor in athens after the departure of phidias for olympia but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies
in greek mythology alcmene or alcmena was the wife of amphitryon by whom she bore two children iphicles and laonome
she is best known as the mother of heracles whose father was the god zeus
alcmene was also referred to as electryone a patronymic name as a daughter of electryon
according to the bibliotheca alcmene was born to electryon the son of perseus and andromeda and king of tiryns and mycenae or medea in argolis
her mother was anaxo daughter of alcaeus and astydamia
other accounts say her mother was lysidice the daughter of pelops and hippodameia or eurydice the daughter of pelops
according to pausanias the poet asius made alcmene the daughter of amphiaraus and eriphyle
hesiod describes alcmene as the tallest most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents
it is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as aphrodites and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her
according to the bibliotheca alcmene went with amphitryon to thebes where he was purified by creon for accidentally killing electryon
alcmene refused to marry amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers
during amphitryons expedition against the taphians and teleboans when zeus desired to sleep with alcmene he made one night last longer extending it to three by ordering helios the sun god not to rise for three whole days
he then visited alcmene disguised as amphitryon
zeus persuaded alcmene that he was her husband
thus zeus slept with alcmene his great granddaughter thereby conceiving heracles while recounting amphitryons victories against the teleboans
when amphitryon finally returned to thebes alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her he learned from tiresias what zeus had done
in homers iliad when alcmene was about to give birth to heracles zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by zeus himself would be born and rule all those around him
hera after requesting zeus to swear an oath to that effect descended from olympus to argos and made the wife of sthenelus give birth to eurystheus after only seven months while at the same time preventing alcmene from delivering heracles
this resulted in the fulfillment of zeuss oath in that it was eurystheus rather than heracles
according to ovids metamorphoses while in labour alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child
after seven days and nights of agony alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon lucina the goddess of childbirth
while lucina did go to alcmene she had been previously instructed by juno to prevent the delivery
with her hands clasped and legs crossed lucina muttered charms thereby preventing alcmene from giving birth
alcmene writhed in pain cursed the heavens and came close to death
galanthis a maid of alcmene who was nearby observed lucinas behaviour and quickly deduced that it was junos doing
to put an end to her mistresss suffering she announced that alcmene had safely delivered her child which surprised lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands
as soon as lucina leapt up alcmene was released from her spell and gave birth to heracles
as punishment for deceiving lucina galanthis was transformed into a weasel she continued to live with alcmene
in pausanias recounting hera sent witches to hinder alcmenes delivery of heracles
the witches were successful in preventing the birth until historis daughter of tiresias thought of a trick to deceive the witches
like galanthis historis announced that alcmene had delivered her child having been deceived the witches went away allowing alcmene to give birth
in contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above an alternative version is presented in amphitryon a comedic play by plautus
here alcmene calls upon jupiter who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain
after a crash of thunder and light the baby arrives without anyones assistance
after the death of amphitryon alcmene married rhadamanthys son of zeus and lived with him in exile at ocaleae in boeotia
it is said that after heracles was apotheosised hyllus having pursued and killed eurystheus cut off eurystheus head and gave it to alcmene who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins
in metamorphoses an aging alcmene recounted the story of the birth of heracles to iole
there are two accounts of alcmenes death
in the first according to the megarians alcmene was walking from argos to thebes when she died at megara
the heracleidae fell into disagreement about where to take alcmenes body with some wishing to take her corpse back to argos and others wishing to take it to thebes to be buried with amphitryon and heracles children by megara
however the god in delphi gave the heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury alcmene in megara
in the second account given by the thebans when alcmene died she was turned from human form to a stone
pausanias indicated that an altar to alcmene had been built in the cynosarges in athens alongside altars to heracles hebe and iolaus
pausanias also said that alcmenes tomb is located near the olympieum at megara
alcidamas of elaea in aeolis was a greek sophist and rhetorician who flourished in the th th century bc he was the pupil and successor of gorgias and taught at athens at the same time as isocrates to whom he was a rival and opponent
we possess two declamations under his name on sophists directed against isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches odysseus in which odysseus accuses palamedes of treachery during the siege of troy
according to alcidamas the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking ex tempore on every conceivable subject
aristotle criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far fetched metaphors
of other works only fragments and the titles have survived messeniakos advocating the freedom of the messenians and containing the sentiment that god has left all men free nature has made no man a slave a eulogy of death in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings a techne or instruction book in the art of rhetoric and a phusikos logos
lastly his mouseion seems to have contained the narrative of the contest of homer and hesiod of which the version that has survived is the work of a grammarian in the time of hadrian based on alcidamas
this hypothesis of the contents of the mouseion originally suggested by nietzsche appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus findsone rd century bc one nd century bc and one nd or rd century ad the aldine press was the printing office started by aldus manutius in in venice from which were issued the celebrated aldine editions of the classics
the first book that was dated and printed under his name appeared in
the aldine press is famous in the history of typography among other things for the introduction of italics
the press was the first to issue printed books in the small octavo size similar to that of a modern paperback and intended for portability and ease of reading
according to curt f
bhler the press issued books during twenty years of activity under aldus manutius
after manutius death in the press was continued by his wife maria and her father andrea torresani until manutius son paulus took over
his grandson aldus manutius the younger then ran the firm until his death in
today the antique books printed by the aldine press in venice are referred to as aldines as are the letterforms and typefaces pioneered by the aldine press
the press enjoyed a monopoly of works printed in greek in the republic of venice effectively giving it copyright protection
protection outside the republic was more problematic however
the firm maintained an agency in paris but its commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions produced in lyon and elsewhere
aldus manutius the founder of the aldine press was originally a humanist scholar and a teacher
manutius met andrea torresani who had acquired publishing equipment from the widow of nicholas jenson
the ownership of the press was originally split in two with one half belonging to pier francesco barbarigo the nephew of agostino barbarigo who was the doge at the time and the other half belonging to torresani
manutius owned one fifth of torresanis share of the press
manutius was mainly in charge of the scholarship and editing leaving financial and operating concerns to barbarigo and torresani
in manutius established his own location of the press in a building called the thermae in the sestiere di san polo on the campo santagostin today numero civico san polo on the calle della chiesa now the location of the restaurant due colonne
though there are two commemorative plaques located on the building numero civico rio ter secondo historians regard them to be erroneously placed based on contemporaneous letters addressed to manutius
the first erroneous plaque had been placed by abbot don vincenzo zenier in
manutius lived and worked in the thermae in order to produce published books from the aldine press
this was also the location of the new academy where a group of manutius friends associates and editors came together to translate greek and latin texts
in manutius married maria the daughter of torresani
torresani and manutius were already business partners but the marriage combined the two partners shares in the publishing business
after the marriage manutius lived at torresanis house
shrinking in popularity in the aldine press was moved to torresanis house in the parish of san paternian
it was later demolished in and was covered by a bank building in the venice square campo manin
the press was started by manutius due to a combination of his love of classics and the need for preservation of hellenic studies
during its initial era the press printed new copies of plato aristotle and other greek and latin classics
the first edition of platos works was dedicated to pope leo x and included the poem of musurus and the life of plato by diogenes laertius which were also included in the first two editions of platos works printed in basel
the two basel editions were introduced by a latin preface written by the greek scholar simon grynaeus who dedicated the work to the humanist thomas more
manutius also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books used by scholars wanting to learn greek who would employ learned greeks in order to teach them directly
historian elizabeth eisenstein claims that the fall of constantinople in had placed under threat the importance and survival of greek scholarship but that publications such as those by the aldine press secured it once more
erasmus was one of the scholars learned in greek with whom the aldine press partnered in order to provide accurately translated text
the aldine press also expanded into modern languages mainly italian and french
manutius eventually took on a project to improve upon the humanistic font designs of jensons typefaces hiring francesco griffo to design and cut typefaces for his print editions of classical literature
humanistic fonts based on the formal hand of renaissance humanist scribes and notaries had been in development from the time movable print arrived in italy notably by nicolas jenson in
griffo developed his own further refinements of style resulting in one of the earliest roman typefaces produced
adapting this admired and influential roman faced font manutius and griffo went on to produce a cursive variant the first of what is now known as italic type
the word italic is derived from early italian versions of italic faces which were designed primarily in order to save on the cost of paper
the aldine press first used italic type in a woodcut of saint catherine of siena in
their edition of virgils opera was the first book to be printed in italic type
the roman typeface and italic form created and pioneered by manutius and griffo were highly influential in typographic development
beginning in manutius produced plain texts in a portable form using the term meaning handbook
the octavo was the first version of the editio minor
although these new portable books were not cheap the books of the aldine press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment comparable to that of large volumes of text and commentary during this era
these books consisted on an edited text issued without commentary printed in a typeface mimicking chancery script produced in a small book which could sit comfortably in the hand
the editio minor in many ways brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics
an individual no longer had to go to the book but rather the book came along with them
in aldus used as his publishers device the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor
the dolphin and anchor device owed its origins most immediately to pietro bembo
aldus told erasmus six years later that bembo had given him a silver coin minted under the roman emperor vespasian bearing an image of this device
the image of the dolphin and anchor on the coin came with the saying festina lente meaning make haste slowly
this would later become the motto for the aldine press
manutius died on february
following his death the firm was run by torresani and his daughter maria the widow of manutius
the name of the press was changed in to in the house of aldus and andrea torresano and kept this name until
in paulus manutius managed the firm starting it up again and changing its name to heirs of aldus and andrea torresano
in the imprint changed to sons of aldo manuzio
in aldus manutius the younger took over and maintained the business until his death
a partial list of publications from the aldine press cited from aldus manutius a legacy more lasting than bronze
works published from the greeks
manutius printed thirty editiones principes of greek texts allowing these texts to escape the fragility of the manuscript tradition
latin works libelli portatiles the most nearly complete collection of aldine editions ever brought together was originally housed in the althorp library of the nd earl spencer and is now in the john rylands library manchester
in north america the most substantial aldine holdings can be found in the ahmanson murphy aldine collection at university of california los angeles the harry ransom center at university of texas at austin and the harold b
lee library at brigham young university
ealdred was abbot of tavistock bishop of worcester and archbishop of york in early medieval england
he was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period
after becoming a monk at the monastery at winchester he was appointed abbot of tavistock abbey in around
in he was named to the bishopric of worcester
ealdred besides his episcopal duties served edward the confessor the king of england as a diplomat and as a military leader
he worked to bring one of the kings relatives edward the exile back to england from hungary to secure an heir for the childless king
in he undertook a pilgrimage to jerusalem the first bishop from england to do so
as administrator of the diocese of hereford he was involved in fighting against the welsh suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with gruffydd ap llywelyn a welsh ruler
in ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of york but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment managing to do so only when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of york and worcester simultaneously
he helped secure the election of wulfstan as his successor at worcester
during his archiepiscopate he built and embellished churches in his diocese and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood
some sources say that following king edward the confessors death in it was ealdred who crowned harold godwinson as king of england
ealdred supported harold as king but when harold was defeated at the battle of hastings ealdred backed edgar the theling and then endorsed king william the conqueror the duke of normandy and a distant relative of king edwards
ealdred crowned king william on christmas day in
william never quite trusted ealdred or the other english leaders and ealdred had to accompany william back to normandy in but he had returned to york by the time of his death in
ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects
ealdred was probably born in the west of england and could be related to lyfing his predecessor as bishop of worcester
his family from devonshire may have been well to do
another relative was wilstan or wulfstan who under ealdreds influence became abbot of gloucester
ealdred was a monk in the cathedral chapter at winchester cathedral before becoming abbot of tavistock abbey about an office he held until about
even after leaving the abbacy of tavistock he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death
no contemporary documents relating to ealdreds time as abbot have been discovered
ealdred was made bishop of worcester in a position he held until his resignation in
he may have acted as suffragan or subordinate bishop to his predecessor lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric as from about ealdred witnessed as an episcopus or bishop and a charter from or early names sihtric as abbot of tavistock
lyfing died on march and ealdred became bishop of worcester shortly after
however ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses lyfing had held crediton and cornwall king edward the confessor granted these to leofric who combined the two sees at crediton in
ealdred was an advisor to king edward the confessor and was often involved in the royal government
he was also a military leader and in he led an unsuccessful expedition against the welsh
this was in retaliation for a raid led by the welsh rulers gruffydd ap rhydderch rhys ap rhydderch and gruffydd ap llywelyn
ealdreds expedition was betrayed by some welsh soldiers who were serving with the english and ealdred was defeated
in ealdred went to rome on the kings errand apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat or centre of the bishopric of crediton to exeter
it may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage if sources from after the norman conquest are to be believed
while in rome he attended a papal council along with his fellow english bishop herman
that same year as ealdred was returning to england he met sweyn a son of godwin earl of wessex and probably absolved sweyn for having abducted the abbess of leominster abbey in
through ealdreds intercession sweyn was restored to his earldom which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin beorn estrithson
ealdred helped sweyn not only because ealdred was a supporter of earl godwins family but because sweyns earldom was close to his bishopric
as recently as irish raiders had allied with gruffydd ap rhydderch of gwent in raiding along the river usk
ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders but was again routed by the welsh
this failure underscored ealdreds need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids
normally the bishop of hereford would have led the defence in the absence of an earl of hereford but in the incumbent thelstan was blind so ealdred took on the role of defender
earl godwins rebellion against the king in came as a blow to ealdred who was a supporter of the earl and his family
ealdred was present at the royal council at london that banished godwins family
later in when he was sent to intercept harold godwinson and his brothers as they fled england after their fathers outlawing ealdred could not or would not capture the brothers
the banishment of ealdreds patron came shortly after the death of lfric puttoc the archbishop of york
york and worcester had long had close ties and the two sees had often been held in plurality or at the same time
ealdred probably wanted to become archbishop of york after lfrics death but his patrons eclipse led to the king appointing cynesige a royal chaplain instead
in september though godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power
by late ealdred was once more in royal favour
at some point he was alleged to have accompanied swein on a pilgrimage to the holy land but proof is lacking
in king edward sent ealdred to germany to obtain emperor henryiiis help in returning edward the exile son of edmund ironside to england
edmund was an elder half brother of king edward the confessor and edmunds son edward was in hungary with king andrewi having left england as an infant after his fathers death and the accession of cnut as king of england
in this mission ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the german church during a stay of a year with hermannii the archbishop of cologne
he also was impressed with the buildings he saw and later incorporated some of the german styles into his own constructions
the main objective of the mission however was to secure the return of edward but this failed mainly because henryiiis relations with the hungarians were strained and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help ealdred
ealdred was able to discover that edward was alive and had a place at the hungarian court
although some sources say ealdred attended the coronation of emperor henryiv this is not possible as on the date henry was crowned ealdred was in england consecrating an abbot
ealdred had returned to england by and brought with him a copy of the pontificale romano germanicum a set of liturgies
an extant copy of this work currently manuscript cotton vitellus e xii has been identified as a copy owned by ealdred
it appears likely that the rule of chrodegang a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons was introduced into england by ealdred sometime before
probably he brought it back from germany possibly in concert with harold
after ealdreds return to england he took charge of the sees of hereford and ramsbury
ealdred also administered winchcombe abbey and gloucester abbey
the authors of the handbook of british chronology third edition say he was named bishop of hereford in holding the see until he resigned it in but other sources say he merely administered the see while it was vacant or that he was bishop of hereford from to
ealdred became involved with the see of ramsbury after its bishop herman got into a dispute with king edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to malmesbury abbey
herman wished to move the seat of his see but edward refused permission for the move
ealdred was a close associate of hermans and the historian h
loyn called herman something of an alter ego to ealdred
according to the medieval chronicler john of worcester ealdred was given the see of ramsbury to administer while herman remained outside england
herman returned in and resumed his bishopric
there is no contemporary documentary evidence of ealdreds administration of ramsbury
the king again employed ealdred as a diplomat in when he assisted earls harold and leofric in negotiations with the welsh
edward sent ealdred after the death in battle of bishop leofgar of hereford who had attacked gruffydd ap llywelyn after encouragement from the king
however leofgar lost the battle and his life and edward had to sue for peace
although details of the negotiations are lacking gruffydd ap llywelyn swore loyalty to king edward but the oath may not have had any obligations on gruffydds part to edward
the exact terms of the submission are not known in total but gruffydd was not required to assist edward in war nor attend edwards court
ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of hereford which he held until and was appointed archbishop of york
the diocese had suffered a serious raid from the welsh in and during his administration ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapters rights
ealdred was granted the administration so that the area might have someone with experience with the welsh in charge
in ealdred made a pilgrimage to jerusalem the first english bishop to make the journey
he travelled through hungary and the anglo saxon chronicle said that he went to jerusalem in such state as no one had done before him
while in jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the church of the holy sepulchre
it is possible that the reason ealdred travelled through hungary was to arrange the travel of edward the exiles family to england
another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to king edward in hungary
it is not known exactly when edward the exiles family returned to england whether they returned with edward in or sometime later so it is only a possibility that they returned with ealdred in
very little documentary evidence is available from ealdreds time as bishop of worcester
only five leases that he signed survive and all date from to
two further leases exist in hemmings cartulary as copies only
how the diocese of worcester was administered when ealdred was abroad is unclear although it appears wulfstan the prior of the cathedral chapter performed the religious duties in the diocese
on the financial side the evesham chronicle states that thelwig who became abbot of evesham abbey in administered worcester before he became abbot
cynesige the archbishop of york died on december and ealdred was elected archbishop of york on christmas day
although a bishop was promptly appointed to hereford none was named to worcester and it appears ealdred intended to retain worcester along with york which several of his predecessors had done
there were a few reasons for this one of which was political as the kings of england preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism
another reason was that york was not a wealthy see and worcester was
holding worcester along with york allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself
in ealdred travelled to rome to receive the pallium the symbol of an archbishops authority
journeying with him was tostig another son of earl godwin who was now earl of northumbria
william of malmesbury says that ealdred by amusing the simplicity of king edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors had acquired more by bribery than by reason the archbishopric of york while still holding his former see
on his arrival in rome however charges of simony or the buying of ecclesiastical office and lack of learning were brought against him and his elevation to york was refused by pope nicholas ii who also deposed him from worcester
the story of ealdred being deposed comes from the vita edwardi a life of edward the confessor but the vita wulfstani an account of the life of ealdreds successor at worcester wulfstan says nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for worcester was given by ealdred
yet another chronicler john of worcester mentions nothing of any trouble in rome and when discussing the appointment of wulfstan says wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people
john of worcester also claims that at wulfstans consecration stigand the archbishop of canterbury extracted a promise from ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of worcester
given that john of worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the canterbury york supremacy struggle the story of ealdred renouncing any claims to worcester needs to be considered suspect
for whatever reason ealdred gave up the see of worcester in when papal legates arrived in england to hold a council and make sure ealdred relinquished worcester
this happened at easter in
ealdred was succeeded by wulfstan chosen by ealdred but john of worcester relates that ealdred had a hard time deciding between wulfstan and thelwig
the legates had urged the selection of wulfstan because of his saintliness
because the position of stigand the archbishop of canterbury was irregular wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from ealdred
normally wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of canterbury as the see of worcester was within canterburys province
although ealdred gave up the bishopric the appointment of wulfstan was one that allowed ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of worcester
ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to worcester
even after the norman conquest ealdred still controlled some events in worcester and it was ealdred not wulfstan who opposed urse dabetots attempt to extend the castle of worcester into the cathedral after the norman conquest
while archbishop ealdred built at beverley expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor cynesige as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese
he also built refectories for the canons at york and southwell
he also was the one bishop who published ecclesiastical legislation during edward the confessors reign attempting to discipline and reform the clergy
he held a synod of his clergy shortly before
john of worcester a medieval chronicler said ealdred crowned king haroldii in although the norman chroniclers mention stigand as the officiating prelate
given ealdreds known support of godwins family john of worcester is probably correct
stigands position as archbishop was canonically suspect and as earl harold had not allowed stigand to consecrate one of the earls churches it is unlikely harold would have allowed stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation
arguments for stigand having performed the coronation however rely on the fact that no other english source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony all norman sources name stigand as the presider
in all events ealdred and harold were close and ealdred supported harolds bid to become king
ealdred perhaps accompanied harold when the new king went to york and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after harolds consecration
according to the medieval chronicler geoffrey gaimar after the battle of stamford bridge harold entrusted the loot gained from harald hardrada to ealdred
gaimar asserts that king harold did this because he had heard of duke williams landing in england and needed to rush south to counter it
after the battle of hastings ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate edgar the theling edward the exiles son as king but eventually he submitted to william the conqueror at berkhamsted
john of worcester says the group supporting edgar vacillated over what to do while william ravaged the countryside which led to ealdred and edgars submission to william
ealdred crowned william king on christmas day
an innovation in williams coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning ealdred asked the assembled crowd in english if it was their wish that william be crowned king
the bishop of coutances then did the same but in norman french
in march william took ealdred with him when william returned to normandy along with the other english leaders earl edwin of mercia earl morcar edgar the theling and archbishop stigand
ealdred at whitsun performed the coronation of matilda williams wife
the laudes regiae or song commending a ruler that was performed at matildas coronation may have been composed by ealdred himself for the occasion
in when the northern thegns rebelled against william and attempted to install edgar the theling as king ealdred continued to support william
he was the only northern leader to support william however
ealdred was back at york by
he died there on september and his body was buried in his episcopal cathedral
he may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in and
the medieval chronicler william of malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of worcester urse dabetot encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for worcester cathedral ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him saying thou are called urse
may you have gods curse
after ealdreds death one of the restraints on williams treatment of the english was removed
ealdred was one of a few native englishmen who william appears to have trusted and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate englishmen into the administration although such efforts did not entirely stop
in a church council was held at westminster and a number of bishops were deposed
by there were only two englishmen in episcopal sees and by the time of williams death in there was only one wulfstanii of worcester
ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese
he built the monastic church of st peter at gloucester then part of his diocese of worcester
he also repaired a large part of beverley minster in the diocese of york adding a presbytery and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower
intermingled with gold in various ways and in a wonderful fashion
he added a pulpit in german style of bronze gold and silver surmounted by an arch with a rood cross in the same materials these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest
ealdred encouraged folcard a monk of canterbury to write the life of saint john of beverley
this was part of ealdreds promotion of the cult of saint john who had been canonised only since
along with the pontificale ealdred may have brought back from cologne the first manuscript of the cambridge songs to enter england a collection of latin goliardic songs which became famous in the middle ages
the historian michael lapidge suggests that the laudes regiae which are included in cotton vitellius exii might have been composed by ealdred or a member of his household
another historian h
cowdrey argued that the laudes were composed at winchester
these praise songs are probably the same performed at matildas coronation but might have been used at other court ceremonies before ealdreds death
historians have seen ealdred as an old fashioned prince bishop
others say he raised the see of york from its former rustic state
he was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities
after the conquest ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre and post conquest worlds
one modern historian feels it was ealdred who was behind the compilation of the d version of the anglo saxon chronicle and gives a date in the s as its composition
certainly ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work and it is likely one of his clerks compiled the version
alexander i of epirus also known as alexander molossus was a king of epirus of the aeacid dynasty
as the son of neoptolemus i and brother of olympias alexander i was an uncle and a brother in law of alexander the great
he was also an uncle to pyrrhus of epirus
neoptolemus i ruled jointly with his brother arybbas
when neoptolemus died in c
bc his son alexander was only a child and arrybas became the sole king
in c
bc alexander was brought to the court of philip ii of macedon in order to protect him
in in his late s philip made him king of epirus after dethroning his uncle arybbas
when olympias was repudiated by her husband in bc she went to her brother and endeavoured to induce him to make war on philip
alexander however declined the contest and formed a second alliance with philip by agreeing to marry the daughter of philip cleopatra
during the wedding in bc philip was assassinated by pausanias of orestis
in bc alexander i at the request of the greek colony of taras crossed over into italy to aid them in battle against several italic tribes including the lucanians and bruttii
after a victory over the samnites and lucanians near paestum in bc he made a treaty with the romans
he then took heraclea from the lucanians and terina and sipontum from the bruttii
through the treachery of some lucanian exiles he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the battle of pandosia and was killed by a lucanian
he left a son neoptolemus and a daughter cadmea
in a famous passage livy speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between alexander the great and the roman republic
he reports that as alexander of epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter waged war against women
alexander i theopator euergetes surnamed balas was the ruler of the seleucid empire from bc to august bc
picked from obscurity and supported by the neighboring roman allied kingdom of pergamon alexander landed in phoenicia in bc and started a civil war against seleucid king demetrius i soter
backed by mercenaries and factions of the seleucid empire unhappy with the existing government he defeated demetrius and took the crown in bc
he married the princess cleopatra thea to seal an alliance with the neighboring ptolemaic kingdom
his reign saw the steady retreat of the seleucid empires eastern border with important eastern satrapies such as media being lost to the nascent parthian empire
in bc demetrius ii nicator the young son of demetrius i began a campaign to overthrow balas and civil war resumed
alexanders ally ptolemaic king ptolemy vi philometor moved troops into coele syria to support alexander but then switched sides and threw his support behind demetrius ii
at the battle of the oenoparus river in syria he was defeated by ptolemy vi and he died shortly afterward
alexander balas claimed to be the son of antiochus iv epiphanes and laodice iv and heir to the seleucid throne
the ancient sources polybius and diodorus say that this claim was false and that he and his sister laodice vi were really natives of smyrna of humble origin
however polybius became friends with balass rival king demetrius i when both were hostages in rome so polybius is not an unbiased source on this matter
modern scholars disagree about whether the story of attalus finding a commoner who looked the part is true or was propaganda put about by alexanders opponents
according to diodorus alexander was originally put forward as a candidate for the seleucid throne by attalus ii of pergamum
attalus had been disturbed by the seleucid king demetrius is interference in cappadocia where he had dethroned king ariarathes v
boris chrubasik is sceptical noting that there is little subsequent evidence for attalid involvement with alexander
however selene psoma has proposed that a large set of coins minted in a number of cities under attalid control in this period was produced by attalus ii in order to fund alexanders bid for the kingship
alexander and his sister were maintained in cilicia by heracleides a former minister of antiochus iv and brother of timarchus an usurper in media who had been executed by the reigning king demetrius i soter
in bc heracleides brought alexander and his sister to rome where he presented alexander to the roman senate which recognised him as the legitimate seleucid king and agreed to support him in his bid to take the throne
polybius mentions that attalus ii and demetrius i also met with the senate at this time but does not state how this was connected to the recognition of alexander if at all
after recruiting mercenaries alexander and heracleides departed to ephesus
from there they invaded phoenicia by sea seizing ptolemais akko
numismatic evidence shows that alexander had also gained control of seleucia pieria byblos beirut tyre by bc
on this coinage alexander heavily advertised his connection to antiochus iv depicting zeus nicephorus on his coinage as antiochus had done
he also assumed the title of theopator which recalled antiochus epithet theos epiphanes
the coinage also presented alexander balas in the guise of alexander the great with pronounced facial features and long flowing hair
this was intended to emphasise his military prowess to his soldiers
alexander and demetrius i competed with another to win over jonathan apphus the leader of the ascendant faction in judaea
jonathan was won over to alexanders side by the grant of a high position in the seleucid court and the high priesthood in jerusalem
reinforced by jonathans hardened soldiers alexander fought a decisive battle with demetrius in july bc in which demetrius was killed
by autumn alexanders kingship was recognised throughout the seleucid realm
alexander gained control of antioch at this time and his chancellor ammonius murdered all the courtiers of demetrius i as well as his wife laodice and his eldest son antigonus
ptolemy vi philometor of egypt entered into an alliance with alexander which was sealed by alexanders marriage to his daughter cleopatra thea
the wedding took place at ptolemais with ptolemy vi and jonathan apphus in attendance
alexander took the opportunity to shower honours on jonathan whom he treated as his main agent in judaea
the marriage was advertised by a special coinage issue depicting the royal pair side by side only the second depiction of a queen on seleucid coinage
she is shown with divine attributes and is depicted in front of the king
some scholars have seen alexander as little more than a ptolemaic puppet arguing that this coinage emphasises cleopatras dominance over him and that the chancellor ammonius was a ptolemaic agent
other scholars argue that the alliance was advertised as an important one but that the arguments for alexanders subservience have been overstated
meanwhile the seleucid positions in the eastern upper satrapies already weakened by the previous kings failure to contain the parthians and the greco bactrians suffered almost complete collapse
the parthians under mithridates i took advantage of the general instability to invade media
the region had been lost to seleucid control by the middle of bc
at around the same time the local nobles in elymais and persis asserted their own ephemeral independence only to be soon also subdued by the parthians
by bc at the latest the parthians also secured their hold over hyrcania at the coast of the caspian sea
by bc the parthians stood at the doorsteps of babylonia one of the seleucid empires hearthlands and location of one of its two capital cities seleucia on tigris
alexander is not recorded to do anything of note to stem the steady erosion of seleucid power in the east
ancient historians hostile to him depict him as too distracted by a life of debauchery to take action to stop the parthians unlike earlier seleucid kings who would mount expeditions to the eastern satrapies to deter the parthians
he was reputed to hand the administration over to two commanders hierax and diodotus neither of whom seemed to care for anything but their own interests
this representation is at least partially a product of his opponents propaganda but it is true that under alexander the seleucid empire continued to see its reach and power slip away
in early bc demetrius son demetrius ii returned to syria with a force of cretan mercenaries led by a man called lasthenes
much of coele syria was lost to him immediately possibly as a result of the succession of the regional commander
jonathan attacked demetriuss position from the south seizing jaffa and ashdod while alexander balas was occupied with a revolt in cilicia
in bc ptolemy vi of egypt invaded syria ostensibly in support of alexander balas
in practice ptolemys intervention came at a heavy cost with alexanders permission he took control of all the seleucid cities along the coast including seleucia pieria
he may also have started minting his own coinage in the syrian cities
while he was at ptolemais akko however ptolemy switched sides
according to josephus ptolemy discovered that alexanders chancellor ammonius had been plotting to assassinate him but when he demanded that ammonius be punished alexander refused
ptolemy remarried his cleopatra thea to demetrius ii and continued his march northward
alexanders commanders of antioch diodotus and hierax surrendered the city to ptolemy
alexander returned from cilicia with his army but ptolemy vi and demetrius ii defeated his forces in a battle of the oenoparus river
earlier alexander had sent his infant son antiochus to an arabian dynast called zabdiel diocles
alexander now fled to arabia in order to join up with zabdiel but he was killed
sources disagree about whether the killer was a pair of his own generals who had decided to switch sides or zabdiel himself
alexanders severed head was brought to ptolemy who also died shortly after from wounds sustained in the battle
zabdiel continued to look after alexanders infant son antiochus until bc when the general diodotus declared him king in order to serve as the figurehead of a rebellion against demetrius ii
in bc another claimant to the throne alexander zabinas would also claim to be alexander balas son almost certainly spuriously
alexander is the title character of the oratorio alexander balus written in by george frideric handel
on some of his coins he is called epiphanes and nicephorus after his pretended father and on others euergetes and theopator
in septuagint it was also called epiphanes
alexander was tyrant or despot of pherae in thessaly ruling from to bc
following the assassination of jason the tyrant of pherae and tagus of thessaly in bc his brother polyphron ruled for a year but he was then poisoned by alexander who assumed power himself
alexander governed tyrannically and was constantly seeking to control thessaly and the kingdom of macedonia
he also engaged in piratical raids on attica
alexander was murdered by tisiphonus lycophron and peitholaus the brothers of his wife thebe as it was said that she lived in fear of her husband and hated alexanders cruel and brutal character
the accounts of how alexander came to power vary somewhat in minor points
diodorus siculus tells us that upon the assassination of the tyrant jason of pherae in bc his brother polydorus ruled for a year but he was then poisoned by alexander another brother
however according to xenophon polydorus was murdered by his brother polyphron who was in turn murdered by his nephew alexander son of jason in bc
plutarch relates that alexander worshipped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god
alexander governed tyrannically and according to diodorus differently from the former rulers but polyphron at least seems to have set him the example
the states of thessaly which had previously acknowledged the authority of jason of pherae were not so willing to submit to alexander the tyrant
therefore they applied for help from alexander ii of macedon
alexander prepared to meet his enemy in macedonia but the king anticipated him and reaching larissa was admitted into the city
alexander withdrew to pherae whilst the macedonian king placed a garrison in larissa as well as in crannon which had also come over to him
but once the bulk of the macedonian army had retired the states of thessaly feared the return and vengeance of alexander and so sent for aid to thebes whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbour who might otherwise become too formidable
thebes accordingly dispatched pelopidas to the aid of thessaly
on arrival of pelopidas at larissa whence according to diodorus he dislodged the macedonian garrison alexander presented himself and offered submission
when pelopidas expressed indignation at the tales of alexanders profligacy and cruelty alexander took alarm and fled
these events appear to refer to the early part of bc
in the summer of that year pelopidas was again sent into thessaly in consequence of fresh complaints against alexander
accompanied by ismenias he went merely as a negotiator without any military force and was seized by alexander and thrown into prison
the scholar william mitford suggested that pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle but the language of demosthenes hardly supports such an inference
the thebans sent a large army into thessaly to rescue pelopidas but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of alexander who aided by auxiliaries from athens pursued them with great slaughter
the destruction of the whole theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of epaminondas who was serving in the campaign but not as general
in bc alexander carried out a massacre of the citizens of scotussa
a fresh theban expedition into thessaly under epaminondas resulted according to plutarch in a three year truce and the release of prisoners including pelopidas
during the next three years alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of thessaly especially magnesia and phthiotis for upon the expiry of the truce in bc they again applied to thebes for protection from him
the theban army under pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an eclipse on july bc and pelopidas leaving the bulk of his army behind entered thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries
at cynoscephalae the thebans defeated alexander but pelopidas was killed
this was closely followed by another theban victory under malcites and diogiton
alexander was then forced to restore the conquered towns to the thessalians confine himself to pherae join the boeotian league and become a dependent ally of thebes
if the death of epaminondas in freed athens from fear of thebes it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from alexander who made a piratical raid on tinos and other cities of the cyclades plundering them and making slaves of the inhabitants
he also besieged peparethus and even landed troops in attica itself and seized the port of panormus a little eastward of sounion
the athenian admiral leosthenes defeated alexander and managed to relieve peparethus but alexander escaped from being blockaded in panormus took several attic triremes and plundered the piraeus
the murder of alexander is assigned by diodorus to bc
plutarch gives a detailed account of it with a lively picture of the palace
guards watched throughout the night except at alexanders bedchamber which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door
thebe alexanders wife and cousin concealed her three brothers in the house during the day had the dog removed when alexander had gone to rest and having covered the steps of the ladder with wool brought up the young men to her husbands chamber
though she had taken away alexanders sword they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him
her brothers then entered and killed alexander
his body was cast into the streets and exposed to every indignity
of thebes motive for the murder different accounts are given
plutarch states it to have been fear of her husband together with hatred of alexanders cruel and brutal character and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of pelopidas when she visited him in his prison
in cicero the deed is ascribed to jealousy
other accounts have it that alexander had taken thebes youngest brother as his eromenos and tied him up
exasperated by his wifes pleas to release the youth he murdered the boy which drove her to revenge
it is written in plutarchs second oration on the fortune or the virtue of alexander the great and in claudius aelianus varia historia that alexander left a tragedy in a theatre because he did not wish to weep at fiction when unmoved by his own cruelty
this suggests that while alexander was a tyrant perhaps his iron heart could be softened
the actor was threatened with punishment because alexander was so moved while watching
alexander ii was a king of epirus and the son of pyrrhus and lanassa the daughter of the sicilian tyrant agathocles
he succeeded his father as king in bc and continued the war which his father had begun with antigonus ii gonatas whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of macedon
he was however dispossessed of both macedon and epirus by demetrius ii of macedon the son of antigonus ii upon which he took refuge amongst the acarnanians
by their assistance and that of his own subjects who entertained a great attachment for him he recovered epirus
it appears that he was in alliance with the aetolians
alexander married his paternal half sister olympias by whom he had two sons pyrrhus ptolemy and a daughter phthia
beloch places the death of king alexander ii about and supports this date with an elaborate chain of reasoning
on the death of alexander olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons and married phthia to demetrius
there are extant silver and copper coins of this king
the former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephants head
the reverse represents pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt
alexander jagiellon of the house of jagiellon was grand duke of lithuania from and king of poland from until his death in
he was the fourth son of casimir iv jagiellon
he was elected grand duke of lithuania upon the death of his father and king of poland upon the death of his brother john i albert
alexander was born as the fourth son of king casimir iv of poland and elisabeth daughter of the king albert of hungary
at the time of his fathers death in his eldest brother vladislaus had already become king of bohemia and hungary and croatia and the next oldest brother casimir had died after leading an ascetic and pious life in his final years resulting in his eventual canonization
while the third oldest brother john i albert was chosen by the polish nobility to be the next king of poland the lithuanians instead elected alexander to be their next grand duke
alexander maintained a lithuanian court and multiple lithuanian priests served in his royal chapel of polish royal court
the greatest challenge that alexander faced upon assuming control of the grand duchy was an attack on lithuania by grand duke ivan iii of russia and his allies the tatars of the crimean khanate which commenced shortly after his accession
ivan iii considered himself the heir to the lands of kievan rus and was striving to take back the territory previously gained by lithuania
unable to successfully stop the incursions alexander sent a delegation to moscow to make a peace settlement which was signed in and ceded extensive land over to ivan
in an additional effort to instill a peace between the two countries alexander was betrothed to helena the daughter of ivan iii they were married in vilnius on february
the peace did not last long however as ivan iii resumed hostilities in
the most alexander could do was to garrison smolensk and other strongholds and employ his wife helena to mediate another truce between him and her father after the disastrous battle of vedrosha
in the terms of this truce which was concluded on march lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist russian state alexander pledged not to touch lands including moscow novgorod ryazan and others while a total of cities were ceded
historian edvardas gudaviius said the war of was a kind of reconnaissance mission conducted by the united russia
terms of the ceasefire of showed the planned political aggression of russia its undoubted military superiority
the concept of the sovereign of all russia put forward by ivan iii did not leave room for the existence of the lithuanian state
on june alexanders older brother john i albert died suddenly and alexander was crowned king of poland on december of that year
alexanders shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the polish senate and szlachta who deprived him of control of the mint curtailed his prerogatives and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position
in the sejm passed the act of nihil novi which forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility represented by the two legislative chambers except for laws governing royal cities crown lands mines fiefdoms royal peasants and jews
this was another step in polands progression towards a nobles democracy
during alexanders reign poland suffered additional humiliation at the hands of her subject principality moldavia
only the death of stephen the great hospodar of moldavia enabled poland still to hold her own on the danube river
meanwhile the liberality of pope julius ii who issued no fewer than bulls in favor of poland and granted alexander peters pence and other financial help enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the teutonic order
alexander jagiellon never felt at home in poland and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow lithuanians the most notable of whom was the wealthy lithuanian magnate michael glinski who justified his masters confidence by his great victory over the tatars at kleck news of which was brought to alexander on his deathbed in vilnius
according to giedr micknait interwar lithuanian historians assumed that alexander was the last ruler of the gediminid dynasty who understood the lithuanian language yet did not speak it but there is a lack of sources regarding that
in during the refurbishment of vilnius cathedral the forgotten sarcophagus of alexander was discovered and has since been put on display
alexander iii was emperor of russia king of congress poland and grand duke of finland from march until his death in
he was highly reactionary in domestic affairs and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father alexander ii a policy of counter reforms
under the influence of konstantin pobedonostsev he acted to maximize his autocratic powers
during his reign russia fought no major wars and he came to be known as the peacemaker with the laudatory title of tsar mirotvorets enduring into st century historiography
his major foreign policy achievement was the russo french alliance a major shift in international relations that eventually embroiled russia in world war i
his political legacy represented a direct challenge to the european cultural order set forth by german statesman otto von bismarck intermingling russian influences with the shifting balances of power
alexander was known for his striking appearance a tall heavy set man of enormous muscular strength
in disposition alexander bore little resemblance to his soft hearted liberal father and still less to his refined philosophic sentimental chivalrous yet cunning great uncle emperor alexander i
although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the ballet alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance
indeed he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects
his straightforward abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness while his direct style of expression matched his rough hewn immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements
his education was not such as to soften these peculiarities
alexander was extremely strong
he tore packs of cards in half with his bare hands to entertain his children
when the austrian ambassador threatened that austria would mobilize two or three army corps against russia he twisted a silver fork into a knot and threw it onto the plate of the ambassador
he said that is what i am going to do to your two or three army corps
unlike his extroverted wife alexander disliked social functions and avoided st
at palace balls he was impatient for the events to end
he would order each musician of the orchestra to leave and turn off the lights until the guests left
after an unpleasant childhood experience on a bad tempered mount he developed a lifelong fear of horses
his wife once convinced him to go on a carriage ride with her but as he reluctantly entered the carriage the ponies reared back
he immediately left the carriage and no amount of pleading from his wife could convince him to get back in
after a performance of the ballet tsar kandavl at the mariinsky theatre i first caught sight of the emperor
i was struck by the size of the man and although cumbersome and heavy he was still a mighty figure
there was indeed something of the muzhik peasant about him
the look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me
as he passed where i was standing he raised his head for a second and to this day i can remember what i felt as our eyes met
it was a look as cold as steel in which there was something threatening even frightening and it struck me like a blow
the tsars gaze the look of a man who stood above all others but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him
in later years i came into contact with the emperor on several occasions and i felt not the slightest bit timid
in more ordinary cases tsar alexander iii could be at once kind simple and even almost homely
grand duke alexander alexandrovich was born on march at the winter palace in saint petersburg russian empire the second son and third child of tsesarevich alexander and his first wife maria alexandrovna
he was born during the reign of his grandfather nicholas i
though he was destined to be a strongly counter reforming emperor alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life as he had an elder brother nicholas who seemed of robust constitution
even when nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously and he was betrothed to princess dagmar of denmark daughter of king christian ix of denmark and queen louise of denmark and whose siblings included king frederik viii of denmark queen alexandra of the united kingdom and king george i of greece
great solicitude was devoted to the education of nicholas as tsesarevich whereas alexander received only the training of an ordinary grand duke of that period
this included acquaintance with french english and german and military drill
alexander became tsesarevich upon nicholass sudden death in
he had been very close to his older brother and he was devastated
when he became tsar he reflected that no one had such an impact on my life as my dear brother and friend nixa and lamented that a terrible responsibility fell on my shoulders when nicholas died
as tsesarevich alexander began to study the principles of law and administration under konstantin pobedonostsev then a professor of civil law at moscow state university and later chief procurator of the holy synod of the orthodox church in russia
pobedonostsev instilled into the young mans mind the belief that zeal for russian orthodox thought was an essential factor of russian patriotism to be cultivated by every right minded emperor
while he was heir apparent from to alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government
on his deathbed nicholas allegedly expressed the wish that his fiance princess dagmar of denmark should marry alexander
alexanders parents encouraged the match
on june alexander went to copenhagen to visit dagmar
when they were looking at photographs of the deceased nicholas alexander proposed to dagmar
on in the grand church of the winter palace in st
petersburg alexander wed dagmar who converted to orthodox christianity and took the name maria feodorovna
the union proved a happy one to the end unlike nearly all of his predecessors since peter i there was no adultery in his marriage
the couple spent their wedding night at the tsarevichs private dacha known as my property
alexander and his father became estranged due to their different political views
in alexander ii supported prussia in the franco prussian war which angered the younger alexander
influenced by his danish wife dagmar alexander criticized the shortsighted government for helping the prussian pigs
alexander resented his father for having a long standing relationship with princess catherine dolgorukova while his mother the empress was suffering from chronic ill health
two days after empress marie died his father told him i shall live as i wish and my union with princess dolgorukova is definite but assured him that your rights will be safeguarded
alexander was furious over his fathers decision to marry catherine a month after his mothers death which he believed forever ruined all the dear good memories of family life
his father threatened to disinherit him if he left court out of protest against the marriage
he privately denounced catherine as the outsider and complained that she was designing and immature
after his fathers assassination he reflected that his fathers marriage to catherine had caused the tragedy all the scum burst out and swallowed all that was holy
the guardian angel flew away and everything turned to ashes finally culminating in the dreadful incomprehensible march
on march alexanders father alexander ii was assassinated by members of the organization narodnaya volya
as a result alexander ascended to the russian imperial throne in the village of nennal
he and maria feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the assumption cathedral in moscow on may
alexanders ascension to the throne was followed by an outbreak of anti jewish riots
alexander iii disliked the extravagance of the rest of his family
it was also expensive for the crown to pay so many grand dukes each year
each one received an annual salary of rubles and grand duchesses received a dowry of a million when they married
he limited the title of grand duke and duchess to only children and male line grandchildren of emperors
the rest would bear a princely title and the style of serene highness
he also forbade morganatic marriages as well as those outside of the orthodox church
on the day of his assassination alexander ii signed an ukaz setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch
on ascending to the throne however alexander iii took pobedonostsevs advice and cancelled the policy before its publication
he made it clear that his autocracy would not be limited
all of alexander iiis internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization from his fathers reign
the new emperor believed that the principles of orthodoxy autocracy and nationality introduced by his grandfather nicholas i would quell revolutionary agitation and save russia
alexander weakened the power of the zemstvo and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land owning proprietors appointed by his government land captains
this weakened the nobility and peasantry and strengthed the emperors personal control
in such policies alexander iii followed the advice of konstantin pobedonostsev who retained control of the church in russia through his long tenure as procurator of the holy synod and who became tutor to alexanders son and heir nicholas
other conservative advisors included count d
tolstoy and i
journalists such as mikhail katkov supported the emperors autocracy policies
the government was overwhelmed in dealing with the russian famine of and the ensuing cholera epidemic which caused to deaths and some liberal activity was tolerated and the zemstvos were recruited to help with relief
among others leo tolstoy helped with relief efforts on his estate and through the british press and chekhov directed anti cholera precautions in several villages
alexander had the political goal of russification which involved homogenizing the language and religion of russias people
he implemented changes such as teaching only the russian language in russian schools in germany poland and finland
he also patronized eastern orthodoxy and dissolved german polish and swedish cultural and religious institutions
alexander was hostile to jews and his reign witnessed a sharp deterioration in their economic social and political condition
his policy was eagerly implemented by tsarist officials in the may laws of
these laws encouraged open anti jewish sentiment and dozens of pogroms across the western part of the empire
as a result many jews emigrated to western europe and the united states
the laws banned jews from inhabiting rural areas and shtetls and restricted the occupations in which they could engage
encouraged by its successful assassination of alexander ii the narodnaya volya movement began planning the murder of alexander iii
the okhrana uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators including aleksandr ulyanov the older brother of vladimir lenin were captured and hanged in may
in foreign affairs alexander iii was a man of peace but not at any price and held that the best means of averting war is to be well prepared for it
diplomat nikolay girs scion of a rich and powerful family served as his foreign minister from to and established the peaceful policies for which alexander has been given credit
girs was an architect of the franco russian alliance of which was later expanded into the triple entente with the addition of great britain
that alliance brought france out of diplomatic isolation and moved russia from the german orbit to a coalition with france one that was strongly supported by french financial assistance to russias economic modernisation
girs was in charge of a diplomacy that featured numerous negotiated settlements treaties and conventions
these agreements defined russian boundaries and restored equilibrium to dangerously unstable situations
the most dramatic success came in settling long standing tensions with great britain which was fearful that russian expansion to the south would be a threat to india
girs was usually successful in restraining the aggressive inclinations of tsar alexander convincing him that the very survival of the tsarist system depended on avoiding major wars
with a deep insight into the tsars moods and views girs was usually able to shape the final decisions by outmaneuvering hostile journalists ministers and even the tsarina as well as his own ambassadors
though alexander was indignant at the conduct of german chancellor otto von bismarck towards russia he avoided an open rupture with germany even reviving the league of three emperors for a period of time and in signed the reinsurance treaty with the germans
however in the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of bismarck by the new german emperor kaiser wilhelm ii and the unwillingness of wilhelm iis government to renew the treaty
in response alexander iii then began cordial relations with france eventually entering into an alliance with the french in
despite chilly relations with berlin the tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the german frontier
with regard to bulgaria he exercised similar self control
the efforts of prince alexander and afterwards of stambolov to destroy russian influence in the principality roused his indignation but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms
in central asian affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending russian domination without provoking conflict with the united kingdom and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand
his reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of russian history but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress
alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at langinkoski manor along the kymi river near kotka on the finnish coast where their children were immersed in a scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty
alexander rejected foreign influence german influence in particular thus the adoption of local national principles was deprecated in all spheres of official activity with a view to realizing his ideal of a russia homogeneous in language administration and religion
these ideas conflicted with those of his father who had german sympathies despite being a patriot alexander ii often used the german language in his private relations occasionally ridiculed the slavophiles and based his foreign policy on the prussian alliance
some differences between father and son had first appeared during the franco prussian war when alexander ii supported the cabinet of berlin while the tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the french
these sentiments would resurface during when the eastern question excited russian society
at first the tsesarevich was more slavophile than the russian government
however his phlegmatic nature restrained him from many exaggerations and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in bulgaria where he commanded the left wing of the invading army
never consulted on political questions alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner
after many mistakes and disappointments the army reached constantinople and the treaty of san stefano was signed but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the congress of berlin
bismarck failed to do what was expected of him by the russian emperor
in return for the russian support which had enabled him to create the german empire it was thought that he would help russia to solve the eastern question in accordance with russian interests but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of saint petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of honest broker at the congress and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with austria hungary for the purpose of counteracting russian designs in eastern europe
the tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the franco prussian war he concluded that for russia the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization
in accordance with this conviction he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced
alexander iii took initiatives to stimulate the development of trade and industry as his father did before him
russias economy was still challenged by the russian turkish war of which created a deficit so he imposed customs duties on imported goods
to further alleviate the budget deficit he implemented increased frugality and accounting in state finances
industrial development increased during his reign
also during his reign construction of the trans siberian railway was started
following his fathers assassination alexander iii was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the winter palace and he relocated his family to the gatchina palace south of st
the palace was surrounded by moats watch towers and trenches and soldiers were on guard night and day
under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into st
petersburg but even then he would stay in the anichkov palace not the winter palace
alexander resented having to take refuge at gatchina
grand duke alexander mikhailovich remembered hearing the tsar say to think that after having faced the guns of the turks i must retreat now before these skunks
in the s alexander fell in love with his mothers lady in waiting princess maria elimovna meshcherskaya
dismayed to learn that prince zu sayn wittgenstein sayn had proposed to her in early he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved dusenka
in after tsesarevich nicholass death tsar alexander ii informed the new tsesarevich alexander that russia had come to a marriage agreement with the parents of princess dagmar of denmark who had been nicholas fiance
initially the tsesarevich refused to travel to copenhagen because he wanted to marry maria
enraged the tsar ordered him to go straight to denmark and propose to princess dagmar
the young alexander wrote in his diary farewell dear dusenka
despite his initial reluctance alexander grew fond of dagmar by the end of his life they loved each other deeply
a few weeks after their wedding he wrote in his diary god grant that
i may love my darling wife more and more
i often feel that i am not worthy of her but even if this was true i will do my best to be
when she left his side he missed her bitterly and complained my sweet darling minny for five years weve never been apart and gatchina is empty and sad without you
in he commissioned peter carl faberg to produce the first jeweled easter eggs for her and she was so delighted that alexander gave her an egg every easter
after alexander died his heir nicholas doubled the tradition every easter commissioning an egg for his wife alexandra feodorovna and one for his mother dagmar
when dagmar nursed him in his final illness alexander told her even before my death i have known an angel
he died in dagmars arms and his daughter olga wrote that my mother still held him in her arms long after he died
alexander had six children by dagmar five of whom survived into adulthood nicholas george xenia michael and olga
he told dagmar that only with children can i relax mentally enjoy them and rejoice looking at them
he wrote in his diary that he was crying like a baby when dagmar gave birth to their first child nicholas
he was much more lenient with his children than most european monarchs and he told their tutors i do not need porcelain i want normal healthy russian children
general cherevin believed that the clever george was the favourite of both parents
alexander enjoyed a more informal relationship with his youngest son michael and doted on his youngest daughter olga
alexander was concerned that his heir apparent nicholas was too gentle and naive to become an effective emperor
when witte suggested that nicholas participate in the trans siberian committee alexander said have you ever tried to discuss anything of consequence with his imperial highness the grand duke dont tell me you never noticed the grand duke is
an absolute child
his opinions are utterly childish
how could he preside over such a committee he was worried that nicholas had no experiences with women and arranged for the polish ballerina mathilde kschessinskaya to become his sons mistress
even at the end of his life he considered nicholas a child and told him i cant imagine you as a fianc how strange and unusual each summer his parents in law king christian ix and queen louise held family reunions at the danish royal palaces of fredensborg and bernstorff bringing alexander maria and their children to denmark
his sister in law the princess of wales would come from great britain with some of her children and his brother in law and cousin in law king george i of greece his wife queen olga who was a first cousin of alexander and a romanov grand duchess by birth came with their children from athens
in contrast to the strict security observed in russia alexander and maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in denmark alexander once commenting to the prince and princess of wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in england while he was returning to his russian prison
in denmark he was able to enjoy joining his children nephews and nieces in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles sneaking into his father in laws orchard to steal apples and playing pranks such as turning a water hose on the visiting king oscar ii of sweden
alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother grand duke vladimir
at a restaurant vladimir had brawled with the french actor lucien guitry when the latter kissed his wife duchess marie of mecklenburg schwerin
the prefect of st
petersburg needed to escort vladimir out of the restaurant
alexander was so furious that he temporarily exiled vladimir and his wife and threatened to exile them permanently to siberia
when alexander and his family survived the borki train disaster in alexander joked i can imagine how disappointed vladimir is going to be when he learns that we all stayed alive this tension was reflected in the rivalry between maria feodorovna and vladimirs wife marie pavlovna
alexander had better relationships with his other brothers alexei sergei and paul
despite the antipathy that alexander had towards his stepmother catherine dolgorukov he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the winter palace for some time after his fathers assassination and to retain keepsakes such alexander iis blood soaked uniform and his reading glasses
even though he disliked their mother alexander was kind to his half siblings
his youngest half sister princess catherine alexandrovna yurievskaya remembered when he would play with her and her siblings the emperor
seemed a playful and kind goliath among all the romping children
on the imperial train derailed in an accident at borki
at the moment of the crash the imperial family was in the dining car
its roof collapsed and alexander held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors
the onset of alexanders kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident
in alexander iii became ill with terminal kidney disease
his first cousin queen olga of greece offered to let him stay at her villa mon repos on the island of corfu in the hope that it might improve the tsars condition
by the time that they reached crimea they stayed at the maly palace in livadia as alexander was too weak to travel any farther
recognizing that the tsars days were numbered various imperial relatives began to descend on livadia
clergyman john of kronstadt paid a visit and administered communion to the tsar
on october alexander received nicholass fiance princess alix of hesse darmstadt who had come from her native darmstadt to receive the tsars blessing
despite being exceedingly weak alexander insisted on receiving alix in full dress uniform an event that left him exhausted
soon after his health began to deteriorate more rapidly
he died in the arms of his wife and in the presence of his physician ernst viktor von leyden at maly palace in livadia on the afternoon of at the age of forty nine and was succeeded by his eldest son tsesarevich nicholas who took the throne as nicholas ii
after leaving livadia on november and traveling to st
petersburg by way of moscow his remains were interred on november at the peter and paul fortress with his funeral being attended by numerous foreign relatives including king christian ix of denmark the prince and princess of wales and duke of york and duke and duchess of saxe coburg gotha and his daughter in law to be alix of hesse and her brother grand duke ernst ludwig of hesse
in a bronze equestrian statue of alexander iii sculpted by paolo troubetzkoy was placed in znamenskaya square in front of the moscow rail terminal in st
both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form leading to the nickname of hippopotamus
troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a caricature jesting that he wished to portray an animal atop another animal and it was quite controversial at the time with many including the members of the imperial family opposed to the design but it was approved because the empress dowager unexpectedly liked the monument
following the revolution of the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until when it was placed in storage
in it was again put on public display although in a different place in front of the marble palace
another pre revolutionary memorial is located in the city of irkutsk at the angara embankment
for alexanders role in forging the franco russian alliance the french republic commissioned a bridge named in his honour pont alexandre iii
it was opened by his son nicholas ii and exists to this day
on november vladimir putin unveiled a bronze monument to alexander iii on the site of the former maly livadia palace in crimea
the four meter monument by russian sculptor andrey kovalchuk depicts alexander iii sitting on a stump his stretched arms resting on a sabre
an inscription says russia has only two allies the army and the navy although historians dispute whether the tsar actually said those words
alexander iii is believed to be one of putins admired historic leaders along with joseph stalin
on june he unveiled another monument to alexander on the site of gatchina palace
domestic foreign alexander iii had six children of his marriage with princess dagmar of denmark also known as marie feodorovna
alexander i posthumously nicknamed the fierce was the king of alba from to his death
he succeeded his brother king edgar and his successor was his brother david
he was married to sybilla of normandy an illegitimate daughter of henry i of england
alexander was the fifth son of malcolm iii and his wife margaret of wessex grandniece of edward the confessor
alexander was named after pope alexander ii
he was the younger brother of king edgar who was unmarried and his brothers heir presumptive by
in that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of saint cuthbert at durham prior to their re interment
he held lands in scotland north of the forth and in lothian
on the death of edgar in alexander succeeded to the scottish crown but in accordance with edgars instructions their brother david was granted an appanage in southern scotland
edgars will granted david the lands of the former kingdom of strathclyde or cumbria and this was apparently agreed in advance by edgar alexander david and their brother in law henry i of england
in perhaps at henrys instigation and with the support of his anglo norman allies david demanded and received additional lands in lothian along the upper tweed and teviot
david did not receive the title of king but of prince of the cumbrians and his lands remained under alexanders final authority
the dispute over tweeddale and teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between alexander and david although it was unpopular in some quarters
a gaelic poem laments its bad what malcolms son has donedividing us from alexanderhe causes like each kings son beforethe plunder of stable alba
the dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between alexander and henry of england
in he joined henry on campaign in wales against gruffudd ap cynan of gwynedd
alexanders marriage with henrys illegitimate daughter sybilla of normandy may have occurred as early as or as late as
william of malmesburys account attacks sybilla but the evidence argues that alexander and sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and sybilla was of noteworthy piety
sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at eilean nam ban in july and was buried at dunfermline abbey
alexander did not remarry and walter bower wrote that he planned an augustinian priory at the eilean nam ban dedicated to sybillas memory and he may have taken steps to have her venerated
alexander had at least one illegitimate child mel coluim mac alaxandair who was later involved in a revolt against david i in the s
he was imprisoned at roxburgh for many years afterwards perhaps until his death sometime after
alexander was like his brothers edgar and david a notably pious king
he was responsible for foundations at scone and inchcolm the latter founded in thanks for his survival of a tempest at sea nearby
he had the two towers built which flanked the great western entrance of dunfermline abbey where his mother was buried
his mothers chaplain and hagiographer thurgot was named bishop of saint andrews in presumably by alexanders order
the case of thurgots would be successor eadmer shows that alexanders wishes were not always accepted by the religious community perhaps because eadmer had the backing of the archbishop of canterbury ralph descures rather than thurstan of york
alexander also patronised saint andrews granting lands intended for an augustinian priory which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife
for all his religiosity alexander was not remembered as a man of peace
john of fordun says of him he manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the province of moray
andrew of wyntouns orygynale cronykil of scotland says that alexander was holding court at invergowrie when he was attacked by men of the isles
walter bower says the attackers were from moray and mearns
alexander pursued them north to stockford in ross where he defeated them
this says wyntoun is why he was named the fierce
the dating of this is uncertain as are his enemies identities
however in the annals of ulster report ladhmann son of domnall grandson of the king of scotland was killed by the men of moray
the king referred to is alexanders father malcolm iii and domnall was alexanders half brother
the province or kingdom of moray was ruled by the family of macbeth and lulach not overmighty subjects but a family who had ruled alba within little more than a lifetime
who the mormaer or king was at this time is not known it may have been engus of moray or his father whose name is not known
as for the mearns the only known mormaer of mearns mel petair had murdered alexanders half brother duncan ii in
alexander died in april at his court at stirling his brother david probably the acknowledged heir since the death of sybilla succeeded him
alexander was depicted in a fantasy novel pater nostras canis dirus the garrison effect
alexander is depicted as troubled by his lack of direct heirs having no child with his wife sybilla of normandy
he points out that his father in law henry i of england is asking them for a grandson
alexander ii was king of alba from until his death
he concluded the treaty of york which defined the boundary between england and scotland virtually unchanged today
alexander was born at haddington east lothian the only son of the scottish king william the lion and ermengarde de beaumont
he was forced to spend time in england under the terms of the treaty of falaise and before he returned home
he succeeded to the kingdom on the death of his father on december being crowned at scone on december the same year
at the time of his accession his sisters isabella and margaret had been sent to england as hostages to king john
he appealed to john through the magna carta which promised to deal with the rights of alexander and his family
in the year after his accession the clans meic uilleim and macheths inveterate enemies of the scottish crown broke into revolt but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection
in the same year alexander joined the english barons in their struggle against king john of england and led an army into the kingdom of england in support of their cause
this action led to the sacking of berwick upon tweed as johns forces ravaged the north
the scottish forces reached the south coast of england at the port of dover where in september alexander paid homage for his lands in england to the pretender louis viii of france chosen by the barons to replace john
after john died the papacy and the english aristocracy changed their allegiance to johns nine year old son henry iii forcing the french and the scots armies to return home
peace between henry louis and alexander followed on september with the treaty of kingston
diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of alexander to henrys sister joan on june or june
in jon haraldsson the last native scandinavian to be jarl of orkney was indirectly implicated in the burning of adam of melrose at his hall at halkirk by local farmers when this part of caithness was still part of the kingdom of norway
a contemporary chronicler boethius the dane blamed haraldsson for the bishops death
after the jarl swore oaths to his own innocence alexander took the opportunity to assert his claims to the mainland part of the orkney jarldom
he visited caithness in person and hanged the majority of the farmers while mutilating the rest
his actions were applauded by pope honorius iii and a quarter of a century later he was continuing to receive commendation from the catholic church as in the reward of a bull from pope celestine iv
during the same period alexander subjugated the hitherto semi independent district of argyll
royal forces crushed a revolt in galloway in without difficulty nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success
soon afterwards a claim for homage from henry of england drew forth from alexander a counter claim to the northern english counties
the two kingdoms however settled this dispute by a compromise in
this was the treaty of york which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the solway firth and the mouth of the river tweed
alexanders first wife joan died in march in essex
alexander married his second wife marie de coucy the following year on may
together they had one son alexander iii born in
a threat of invasion by henry in for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries but the prompt action of alexander in anticipating his attack and the disinclination of the english barons for war compelled him to make peace the next year at newcastle
alexander now turned his attention to securing the western isles which were still part of the norwegian domain of sureyjar
he repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase but without success
alexander set out to conquer these islands but died on the way in
this dispute over the western isles also known as the hebrides was not resolved until when magnus vi of norway ceded them to scotland along with the isle of man
john taunted king alexander and because he was red headed sent word to him saying so shall we hunt the red fox cub from his lairs
alexander attempted to persuade ewen the son of duncan lord of argyll to sever his allegiance to haakon iv of norway
when ewen rejected these attempts alexander sailed forth to compel him but on the way he suffered a fever at the isle of kerrera in the inner hebrides
he died there in and was buried at melrose abbey
the hkonar saga hkonarsonar records additional information in that before attempting to invade the isles where ewen held power he was supposedly warned in a dream by st
columba st
olaf and st
magnus to desist
king ewen of the isles status as monarch had been confirmed by haakon iv and was disputed by alexander
the episode might be emblematic of a broader desire on the part of alexander to bring the kingdom of the isles fully into the power of the scottish crown
in any case when he finally decided to continue in his endeavour despite the dream and having been advised against it by his men he died shortly afterwards
the incident was portrayed in the saga as divine punishment
his body was then transported back to the mainland
he was succeeded by his son the seven year old alexander iii of scotland
joan of england who was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of john of england and isabella of angoulme
she and alexander ii married on june at york minster
alexander was joan was
they had no children
joan died in essex in and was buried at tarant crawford abbey in dorset
marie de coucy who became mother of alexander iii of scotland
he also had an illegitimate daughter marjorie who married alan durward
alexander i reigned as the king of serbia from to when he and his wife draga main were assassinated by a group of royal serbian army officers led by captain dragutin dimitrijevi
alexander was born on august to king milan and queen natalie of serbia
he belonged to the obrenovi dynasty
in king milan unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life proclaiming alexander king of serbia
since the king was only thirteen three regents were appointed head among them jovan ristich
his mother also became his regent
alexander ordered the arrest of the regents on april proclaiming himself of age and dissolving national assembly
on may he abolished his fathers liberal constitution of and restored the previous one
in the young king brought his father milan back to serbia and in appointed him commander in chief of the army
during that time milan was regarded as the de facto ruler of the country
in penalties were brought down upon the radical and the russophil parties which the court sought to tie to an attempted assassination of the former king milan
alexanders attitude during the greco turkish war was one of strict neutrality
in the summer of king alexander suddenly announced his engagement to draga main a disreputable widow of an obscure engineer
alexander had met draga in when she was serving as a maid of honor to his mother
draga was nine years older than the king unpopular with belgrade society well known for her allegedly numerous sexual liaisons and widely believed to be infertile
since alexander was an only child it was imperative to secure the succession by producing an heir
so intense was the opposition to main among the political classes that the king found it impossible for a time to recruit suitable candidates for senior posts
before making the announcement of his intended engagement alexander did not consult with his father who had been on vacation in karlsbad and making arrangements to secure the hand of the suitable german royal princess alexandra karoline of schaumburg lippe member of an old house of lippe sister of the queen of wrttemberg for his son or his prime minister dr vladan orevi who was visiting the universal exhibition in paris at the time of the announcement
both immediately resigned and alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet
alexanders mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom
opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of congratulations of nicholas ii of russia to the king on his engagement and of his agreement to act as the principal witness at the wedding
the marriage duly took place in august
even so the unpopularity of the union weakened the kings position in the eyes of the army and the country at large
king alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a liberal constitution of his own initiative in introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of serbia the system of two chambers
this reconciled the political parties but did not placate the army which already dissatisfied with the kings marriage became still more so at the rumours that one of the two unpopular brothers of queen draga lieutenant nikodije was to be proclaimed heir presumptive to the throne
alexanders good relations and the countrys growing dependence on austria hungary were detested by the serbian public
two million serbs lived in austria hungary with another million in the ottoman empire although many migrated to serbia
meanwhile the independence of the senate and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to king alexander
in march the king suspended the constitution for half an hour time enough to publish decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state
this arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country
attempting to appease the opposition king alexander granted an amnesty to the persecuted radicals and in issued a moderately liberal constitution
a council of state and a second chamber to parliament were instituted
in alexanders rival peter araorevi was proclaimed king by followers at abac and alexander responded by organizing a military cabinet and suspending the constitution
radicals began to plot the kings assassination
the general impression was that as much as the senate was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections king alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim queen dragas brother as the heir presumptive to the throne
in spite of this it had been agreed with the serbian government that prince mirko of montenegro who was married to natalija konstantinovi the granddaughter of princess anka obrenovi an aunt of king milan would be proclaimed heir presumptive in the event that the marriage of king alexander and queen draga was childless
apparently to prevent queen dragas brother being named heir presumptive but in reality to replace alexander obrenovi with peter karaorevi a conspiracy was organized by a group of army officers headed by captain dragutin dimitrijevi also known as apis and novak perii a young serbian orthodox militant who was in the pay of the russian empire as well as the leader of the black hand secret society which would assassinate archduke franz ferdinand in
several politicians were also members of the conspiracy and allegedly included former prime minister nikola pai
the royal couples palace was invaded and they hid in a wardrobe in the queens bedroom
the conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of june
they were shot and their bodies mutilated and disembowelled after which according to eyewitness accounts they were thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure
king alexander and queen draga were buried in the crypt of st
marks church belgrade
alexander iii was king of alba from until his death
he concluded the treaty of perth by which scotland acquired sovereignty over the western isles and the isle of man
his heir margaret maid of norway died before she could be crowned
alexander was born at roxburgh the only son of alexander ii by his second wife marie de coucy
alexanders father died on july and he became king at the age of seven inaugurated at scone on july
the years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties the one led by walter comyn earl of menteith the other by alan durward justiciar of scotia
the former dominated the early years of alexanders reign
at the marriage of alexander to margaret of england in henry iii of england seized the opportunity to demand homage from his son in law for the scottish kingdom but alexander did not comply
in an interview between the english and scottish kings at kelso led to menteith and his party losing to durwards party
but though disgraced they still retained great influence and two years later seizing the person of the king they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties
on attaining his majority at the age of in alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the western isles which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short
he laid a formal claim before king haakon iv of norway
haakon rejected the claim and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion
sailing around the west coast of scotland he halted off the isle of arran and negotiations commenced
alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms began
at length haakon weary of delay attacked only to encounter a terrific storm which greatly damaged his ships
the battle of largs proved indecisive but even so haakons position was hopeless
baffled he turned homewards but died in orkney on december
the isles now lay at alexanders feet and in haakons successor concluded the treaty of perth by which he ceded the isle of man and the western isles to scotland in return for a monetary payment
norway retained orkney and shetland until when they became a dowry for james iiis bride margaret of denmark
alexander had married margaret daughter of king henry iii of england and eleanor of provence on december when he was ten years old and she was eleven
she died in after they had had three children according to the lanercost chronicle alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons virgins or widows as the fancy seized him sometimes in disguise
towards the end of alexanders reign the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance
in he induced the estates to recognize as his heir presumptive his granddaughter margaret the maid of norway
the need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to yolande de dreux on november
alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at kinghorn in fife on march because it was her birthday the next day
he had spent the evening at edinburgh castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors
he was cautioned against making the journey to fife because of weather conditions but crossed the forth from dalmeny to inverkeithing anyway
on arriving in inverkeithing he insisted on not stopping for the night despite the pleas of the nobles accompanying him and one of the burgesses of the town alexander le saucier
le saucier must have been known to the king since his rather blunt warning to the king lacks the usual deference my lord what are you doing out in such weather and darkness how many times have i tried to persuade you that midnight travelling will do you no good however alexander ignored the repeated warnings about travelling in a storm and set off with his retinue and two local guides
the king became separated from his party near kinghorn and was found dead with a broken neck near the shore the following morning
it is assumed that his horse lost its footing in the dark
while some texts say that he fell off a cliff there is none at the site where his body was found however there is a very steep rocky embankment which would have been fatal in the dark
after alexanders death his realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with england
he was buried in dunfermline abbey
as alexander left no surviving children the heir to the throne was his unborn child by queen yolande
when yolandes pregnancy ended probably with a miscarriage alexanders three year old granddaughter margaret maid of norway became the heir
margaret died still uncrowned on her way to scotland in
the inauguration of john balliol as king on november ended the six years of the guardians of scotland governing the land
in a monument to alexander iii was erected at the approximate location of his death in kinghorn
alexander iii has been depicted in historical novels
they include alexander of greece was king of greece from until his death
alexander of aphrodisias was a peripatetic philosopher and the most celebrated of the ancient greek commentators on the writings of aristotle
he was a native of aphrodisias in caria and lived and taught in athens at the beginning of the rd century where he held a position as head of the peripatetic school
he wrote many commentaries on the works of aristotle extant are those on the prior analytics topics meteorology sense and sensibilia and metaphysics
several original treatises also survive and include a work on fate in which he argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity and one on the soul
his commentaries on aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled by way of pre eminence the commentator
alexander was a native of aphrodisias in caria and came to athens towards the end of the nd century
he was a student of the two stoic or possibly peripatetic philosophers sosigenes and herminus and perhaps of aristotle of mytilene
at athens he became head of the peripatetic school and lectured on peripatetic philosophy
alexanders dedication of on fate to septimius severus and caracalla in gratitude for his position at athens indicates a date between and
a recently published inscription from aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the schools at athens and gives his full name as titus aurelius alexander
his full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given roman citizenship by the emperor antoninus pius while proconsul of asia
the inscription honours his father also called alexander and also a philosopher
this fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of alexanders corpus should be ascribed to his father
alexander composed several commentaries on the works of aristotle in which he sought to escape a syncretistic tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of aristotle
his extant commentaries are on prior analytics topics meteorology sense and sensibilia and metaphysics
the commentary on the sophistical refutations is deemed spurious as is the commentary on the final nine books of the metaphysics
the lost commentaries include works on the de interpretatione posterior analytics physics on the heavens on generation and corruption on the soul and on memory
simplicius of cilicia mentions that alexander provided commentary on the quadrature of the lunes and the corresponding problem of squaring the circle
in april it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on aristotles categories in the archimedes palimpsest and robert sharples suggested alexander as the most likely author
there are also several extant original writings by alexander
these include on the soul problems and solutions ethical problems on fate and on mixture and growth
three works attributed to him are considered spurious medical questions physical problems and on fevers
additional works by alexander are preserved in arabic translation these include on the principles of the universe on providence and against galen on motion
on the soul is a treatise on the soul written along the lines suggested by aristotle in his own de anima
alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material and inseparable from the body
he argued strongly against the doctrine of the souls immortality
he identified the active intellect through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual with god
a second book is known as the supplement to on the soul
the mantissa is a series of twenty five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with psychology
the remaining twenty pieces cover problems in physics and ethics of which the largest group deals with questions of vision and light and the final four with fate and providence
the mantissa was probably not written by alexander in its current form but much of the actual material may be his
problems and solutions consists of three books which although termed problems and solutions of physical questions treat of subjects which are not all physical and are not all problems
among the sixty nine items in these three books twenty four deal with physics seventeen with psychology eleven with logic and metaphysics and six with questions of fate and providence
it is unlikely that alexander wrote all of the quaestiones some may be alexanders own explanations while others may be exercises by his students
ethical problems was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the quaestiones
the work is a discussion of ethical issues based on aristotle and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from alexanders school
it is likely that the work was not written by alexander himself but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving alexander
on fate is a treatise in which alexander argues against the stoic doctrine of necessity
in on fate alexander denied three things necessity the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the stoic identification of god and nature and determinism in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand or predetermined by antecedents
he defended a view of moral responsibility we would call libertarianism today
on mixture and growth discusses the topic of mixture of physical bodies
it is both an extended discussion on stoic physics and an exposition of aristotelian thought on this theme
on the principles of the universe is preserved in arabic translation
this treatise is not mentioned in surviving greek sources but it enjoyed great popularity in the muslim world and a large number of copies have survived
the main purpose of this work is to give a general account of aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics but it also has a polemical tone and it may be directed at rival views within the peripatetic school
alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies while also presenting a unified picture of the world both physical and ethical
the topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the sublunar world of generation and decay
his principal sources are the physics metaphysics and the pseudo aristotelian on the universe
on providence survives in two arabic versions
in this treatise alexander opposes the stoic view that divine providence extends to all aspects of the world he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods
instead providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals
by the th century alexanders commentaries on aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as the commentator
his commentaries were greatly esteemed among the arabs who translated many of them and he is heavily quoted by maimonides
in the church council of paris issued a condemnation which probably targeted the writings of alexander among others
in the early renaissance his doctrine of the souls mortality was adopted by pietro pomponazzi and by his successor cesare cremonini
this school is known as alexandrists
alexanders band an optical phenomenon is named after him
several of alexanders works were published in the aldine edition of aristotle venice his de fato and de anima were printed along with the works of themistius at venice the former work which has been translated into latin by grotius and also by schulthess was edited by j
orelli zrich and his commentaries on the metaphysica by h
bonitz berlin
in the first part of his on aristotles metaphysics was published in english translation as part of the ancient commentators project
since then other works of his have been translated into english
marcus aurelius severus alexander also known as alexander severus was roman emperor from until
the last emperor from the severan dynasty he succeeded his slain cousin elagabalus in at the age of
alexander himself was eventually assassinated and his death marked the beginning of the events of the crisis of the third century which included nearly fifty years of civil war foreign invasion and the collapse of the monetary economy
alexander was the heir to his cousin the year old emperor elagabalus
the latter had been murdered along with his mother julia soaemias by his own guards who as a mark of contempt had their remains cast into the tiber river
alexander and his cousin were both grandsons of julia maesa who was the sister of empress julia domna and had arranged for elagabaluss acclamation as emperor by the third gallic legion
alexanders year reign was the longest reign of a sole emperor since antoninus pius
he was also the second youngest sole roman emperor of a united empire after gordian iii
alexanders peacetime reign was prosperous
however rome was militarily confronted with the rising sassanid empire and growing incursions from the tribes of germania
he managed to check the threat of the sassanids
but when campaigning against germanic tribes alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery
this alienated many in the roman army leading to a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of alexander his mother julia avita mamaea and his advisors
after their deaths the accession of maximinus thrax followed
alexanders death marked the epoch event for the crisis of the third century
the future emperor severus alexander was born on october in arca caesarea phoenicia
of his birth name only two cognomina are known from literary sources bassianus according to the historian cassius dio and alexianus according to herodian
bassianus was also borne by several family members while alexianus was probably later converted to alexander
the historian cassius dio thought alexianus was the son of marcus julius gessius marcianus but icks disputes this saying the latter could not have married the emperors mother before and that alexianus must have been fathered by his mothers first husband who is of unknown name but of certain existence
the priest marcus julius gessius bassianus may have been his younger brother
severus alexander became emperor when he was around years old making him the second youngest sole emperor in romes history second only to gordian iii who was
alexanders grandmother maesa believed that he had more potential to rule and gain support from the praetorian guard than her other grandson the increasingly unpopular emperor elagabalus
thus to preserve her own position she had elagabalus adopt the young alexander and then arranged for elagabalus assassination securing the throne for alexander
the roman army hailed alexander as emperor on march and the senate ratified this the following day conferring on him the titles of augustus pater patriae and pontifex maximus on the following day
throughout his life alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother maesa before her death in and mother julia mamaea
as a young immature and inexperienced adolescent alexander knew little about government warcraft or the role of ruling over an empire
in time however the army came to admire what jasper burns refers to as his simple virtues and moderate behavior so different from
under the influence of his mother alexander did much to improve the morals and condition of the people and to enhance the dignity of the state
he employed noted jurists such as ulpian to oversee the administration of justice
his advisers were men like the senator and historian cassius dio and historical sources claimed that with the help of his family he created a select board of senators although this claim is sometimes disputed
some scholars have rejected herodians view that alexander expanded senatorial powers
he also created a municipal council of who assisted the urban prefect in administering the affairs of the districts of rome
excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished and he restored the baths of nero in or consequently they are sometimes also known as the baths of alexander after him
he extended the imperial residence at the horti lamiani on the esquiline hill with elaborate buildings and created the nymphaeum of alexander which still stands in the piazza vittorio emanuele
this was the great fountain he built at the end of the aqua claudia aqueduct
upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the denarius from to the actual silver weight dropped from grams to grams however in he revalued the denarius increasing the silver purity and weight to and grams
the following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver raising the silver purity and weight again to and grams
additionally during his reign taxes were lightened literature art and science were encouraged and for the convenience of the people loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest
in religious matters alexander preserved an open mind
according to the historia augusta he wished to erect a temple to jesus but was dissuaded by the pagan priests however this claim is unreliable as the historia augusta is considered untrustworthy by historians containing significant amounts of information that is false and even invented extending to when it was written and the number of authors it was written by
he allowed a synagogue to be built in rome and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the torah known as the severus scroll
in legal matters alexander did much to aid the rights of his soldiers
he confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their will whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy
he also confirmed that soldiers could free their slaves in their wills protected the rights of soldiers to their property when they were on campaign and reasserted that a soldiers property acquired in or because of military service could be claimed by no one else not even the soldiers father
alexanders reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline
in the praetorian guard murdered their prefect ulpian in alexanders presence
alexander could not openly punish the ringleader of the riot and instead removed him to a nominal post of honor in egypt and then crete where he was quietly put out of the way sometime after the excitement had abated
the soldiers then fought a three day battle against the populace of rome and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire
dio was among those who gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time saying that the soldiers would rather just surrender to the enemy
different reasons are given for this issue campbell points to
the decline in the prestige of the severan dynasty the feeble nature of alexander himself who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mothers advice and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure
herodian on the other hand was convinced that the emperors miserliness and slowness to bestow donatives were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under alexander
on the whole alexanders reign was prosperous until the rise of the sassanids under ardashir i
in ad ardashir invaded the roman provinces of the east overrunning mesopotamia and penetrating possibly as far as syria and cappadocia forcing from the young alexander a vigorous response
of the war that followed there are various accounts
according to the most detailed authority herodian the roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats while according to the historia augusta as well as alexanders own dispatch to the roman senate he gained great victories
making antioch his base he organized in a three fold invasion of the sassanian empire at the head of the main body he himself advanced to recapture northern mesopotamia while another army invaded media through the mountains of armenia and a third advanced from the south in the direction of babylon
the northernmost army gained some success fighting in mountainous territory favorable to the roman infantry but the southern army was surrounded and destroyed by ardashirs skilful horse archers and alexander himself retreated after an indecisive campaign his army wracked by indiscipline and disease
further losses were incurred by the retreating northern army in the inclement cold of armenia as it retired into winter quarters due to a failure through incompetence to establish adequate supply lines
still mesopotamia was retaken and ardashir was not thereafter able to extend his conquests though his son shapur would obtain some success later in the century
although the sassanids were checked for the time the conduct of the roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline
in there was a mutiny in the syrian legion which proclaimed taurinus emperor
alexander managed to suppress the uprising and taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the euphrates
the emperor returned to rome and celebrated a triumph in
a new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after alexanders success in the persian war
in the barbarians crossed the rhine and danube in hordes that caused alarm as far as rome
the soldiers serving under alexander already demoralized after their costly war against the persians were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders
as word of the invasion spread the emperor took the front line and went to battle against the germanic invaders
the romans prepared heavily for the war building a fleet to carry the entire army across
however at this point in alexanders career he still knew little about being a general
because of this he hoped the mere threat of his armies would be sufficient to persuade the hostile tribes to surrender
severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among his legions
due to incurring heavy losses against the persians and on the advice of his mother alexander attempted to buy the germanic tribes off so as to gain time
it was this decision that resulted in the legionaries looking down upon alexander
they considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be emperor
under these circumstances the army swiftly looked to replace alexander
gaius julius verus maximinus was the next best option
he was a soldier from thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status
he was also a man with superior personal strength who rose to his present position from a peasant background
with the thracians hailing came the end of the severan dynasty and with the growing animosity of severus army towards him the path for his assassination was paved
alexander was forced to face his german enemies in the early months of
by the time he and his mother arrived the situation had settled and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence trying to bribe the german army to surrender was the more sensible course of action
according to historians it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity
alexander was thus assassinated together with his mother in early march in a mutiny of the legio xxii primigenia at moguntiacum while at a meeting with his generals
these assassinations secured the throne for maximinus
the historia augusta documents two theories that elaborate on severuss assassination
the first claims that the disaffection of mamaea was the main motive behind the homicide
however lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory that alexander was murdered in sicilia
this theory has it that in an open tent after his lunch alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops who compared him to his cousin elagabalus the divisive and unpopular emperor whose own assassination paved the way for alexanders reign
a german servant entered the tent and initiated the call for alexanders assassination at which point many of the troops joined in the attack
alexanders attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the emperors assassination
within minutes alexander was dead
his mother julia mamaea was in the same tent with alexander and soon fell victim to the same group of assassins
alexanders body was buried together with the body of his mother julia mamaea in a mausoleum in rome
the actual mausoleum called is the third largest in rome after those of hadrian and augustus
it is still visible in piazza dei tribuni in the quadraro area in rome where it resembles a large earth mound
the large sarcophagus found inside the tomb in the th century and which contained the emperors remains is in the palazzo dei conservatori museum in rome
according to some sources inside the same sarcophagus in a precious glass urn was found the portland vase currently on display at the british museum in london
alexanders death marked the end of the severan dynasty
he was the last of the syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale
after his death his economic policies were completely discarded and the roman currency was devalued this signaled the beginning of the chaotic period known as the crisis of the third century which brought the empire to the brink of collapse
alexanders death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for roman emperors
though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during alexanders time emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs
thus alexanders taking of his mothers advice to not get involved in battle his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the germanic threat and the relative failure of his military campaign against the persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers
indeed maximinus was able to overthrow alexander by harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward
yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor the legions paved the way for a half century of widespread chaos and instability
alexander was deified after the death of maximinus in
perhaps his most tangible legacy was the emergence in the th century of the cameo glass portland vase dated to around the reign of augustus
this was allegedly found at the mausoleum of the emperor and his family at monte del grano
the discovery of the vase is described by pietro santi bartoli
pietro bartoli indicates that the vase contained the ashes of severus alexander
however this together with the interpretations of the scenes depicted are the source of countless theories and disputed facts
the vase passed through the hands of sir william hamilton ambassador to the royal court in naples and in was sold to the duchess of portland and has subsequently been known as the portland vase
after an attack by a disturbed man in the british museum in smashed it into many fragments the vase has been reconstructed three times
in the portland vase had been borrowed from the rd duke of portland and copied in black jasperware pottery by josiah wedgwood for his firm wedgwood
he appears to have added some drapery to cover nudity but his replicas were useful in the reconstructions
according to the historia augusta alexanders chief amusement consisted in having young dogs play with little pigs
herodian portrays him as a mothers boy
alexanders only known wife was sallustia orbiana augusta whom he married in when she was years old
their marriage was arranged by alexanders mother mamaea
according to historian herodian however as soon as orbiana received the title of augusta mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of alexanders wife due to mamaeas excessive desire of all regal female titles
alexander divorced and exiled orbiana in after her father seius sallustius was executed after being accused of treason
according to historia augusta a late roman work containing biographies of emperors and others and considered by scholars to be a work of dubious historical reliability alexander was also at some point married to sulpicia memmia a member of one of the most ancient patrician families in rome and a daughter to a man of consular rank her grandfathers name was catulus
she is mentioned as his wife only in this later text thus the marriage has been questioned
the ancient historian zosimus claimed that alexander was married three times
a man named varius macrinus may have been alexanders father in law but it is uncertain if he was the same man as seius sallustius the father of memmia or the father of an entirely unknown third wife
alexander is not known to have fathered any children
the historia augusta claims that alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel
he was extremely tolerant of jews and christians alike
he continued all privileges towards jews during his reign and the augustan history relates that alexander placed images of abraham and jesus in his oratory along with other roman deities and classical figures

alexander jannaeus was the second king of the hasmonean dynasty who ruled over an expanding kingdom of judaea from to bce
a son of john hyrcanus he inherited the throne from his brother aristobulus i and married his brothers widow queen salome alexandra
from his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war alexanders reign has been described as cruel and oppressive with never ending conflict
the major historical sources of alexanders life are josephuss antiquities of the jews and the jewish war
the kingdom of alexander jannaeus was the largest and strongest known jewish state outside of biblical sources having conquered most of the levants mediterranean coastline and regions surrounding the jordan river
alexander also had many of his subjects killed for their disapproval of his handling of state affairs
due to his territorial expansion and adverse interactions with his subjects he was continuously embroiled with foreign wars and domestic turmoil
alexander jannaeus was the third son of john hyrcanus by his second wife
when aristobulus i hyrcanus son by his first wife became king he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half brother
aristobulus died after a reign of one year
upon his death his widow salome alexandra had alexander and his brothers released from prison
one of these brothers is said to have unsuccessfully sought the throne
alexander as the oldest living brother had the right not only to the throne but also to salome the widow of his deceased brother who had died childless
although she was thirteen years older than him he married her in accordance with the jewish law of levirate marriage
by her he had two sons the eldest hyrcanus ii became high priest in bce and aristobulus ii who was high priest from bce and started a bloody civil war with his brother ending in his capture by pompey the great
like his brother alexander was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the sadducees
his wife salome came from a pharisaic family
her brother was simeon ben shetach a famous pharisee leader
salome was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign
like his father alexander served as high priest
this raised the ire of the religious authorities who insisted that these two offices should not be combined
according to the talmud alexander was a questionable desecrated priest rumour had it that his mother was captured in modiin and violated and in the opinion of the pharisees was not allowed to serve in the temple
this infuriated the king and he sided with the sadducees who defended him
this incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and he persecuted them until his death
alexanders first expedition was against the city of ptolemais
while alexander went ahead to besiege the city zoilus of dora took the opportunity to see if he could relieve ptolemais in hopes of establishing his rule over coastal territories
alexanders hasmonean army quickly defeated zoiluss forces
ptolemais then requested aid from ptolemy ix lathyros who had been banished by his mother cleopatra iii
ptolemy founded a kingdom in cyprus after being cast out by his mother
the situation at ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the judean coast in order to invade egypt by sea
an individual named demaenetus convinced the inhabitants of their imprudence in requesting ptolemys assistance
they realised that by allying themselves with ptolemy they had unintentionally declared war on cleopatra
when ptolemy arrived at the city the inhabitants denied him access
alexander too didnt want to be involved in a war between cleopatra and ptolemy so he abandoned his campaign against ptolemais and returned to jerusalem
after offering ptolemy four hundred talents and a peace treaty in return for zoiluss death alexander met him with treachery by negotiating an alliance with cleopatra
once he had formed an alliance with ptolemy alexander continued his conquests by capturing the coastal cities of dora and stratons tower
as soon as ptolemy learned of alexanders scheme he was determined to kill him
ptolemy put ptolemais under siege but left his generals to attack the city while he continued to pursue alexander
ptolemys pursuit caused much destruction in the galilee region
here he captured asochis on the sabbath taking ten thousand people as prisoners
ptolemy also initiated an unsuccessful attack on sepphoris
ptolemy and alexander engaged in battle at asophon near the jordan river
estimated to have fifty to eighty thousand soldiers alexanders army consisted of both jews and pagans
at the head of his armed forces were his elite pagan mercenaries
they were specialised in greek style phalanx
one of ptolemys commanders philostephanus began the first attack by crossing the river that divided both forces
the hasmoneans had the advantage
philostephanus held back a certain amount of his forces whom he sent to recover lost ground
perceiving them as vast reinforcements alexanders army fled
some of his retreating forces tried to push back but quickly dispersed as ptolemys forces pursued alexanders fleeing army
thirty to fifty thousand hasmonean soldiers died
ptolemys forces at ptolemais succeeded in capturing the city
he then continued to conquer much of the hasmonean kingdom occupying the entirety of northern judea the coast and territories east of the jordan river
while doing so he pillaged villages and ordered his soldiers to cannibalise women and children to create psychological fear towards his enemies
at the time salome alexandra was notified of cleopatras approachment to judea
realising that her son had amassed a formidable force in judea cleopatra appointed jewish generals ananias and chelkias to command her forces
she went with a fleet towards judea
when cleopatra arrived at ptolemais the people refused her entry so she besieged the city
ptolemy believing syria was defenseless withdrew to cyprus after his miscalculation
while in pursuit of ptolemy chelkias died in coele syria
the war abruptly came to an end with ptolemy fleeing to cyprus
alexander then approached cleopatra
bowing before her he requested to retain his rule
cleopatra was urged by her subordinates to annex judea
ananias demanded she consider the residential egyptian jews who were the main support of her throne
this induced cleopatra to modify her longings for judea
alexander met her demands and suspended his campaigns
these negotiations took place at scythopolis
cleopatra died five years later
confident after her death alexander found himself free to continue with new campaigns
alexander captured gadara and fought to capture the strong fortress of amathus in the transjordan region but was defeated
he was more successful in his expedition against the coastal cities capturing raphia and anthedon
in bce jannaeus defeated the inhabitants of gaza
this victory gained judean control over the mediterranean outlet of the main nabataean trade route
alexander initially returned his focus back to the transjordan region where avenging his previous defeat he destroyed amathus
determined to proceed with future campaigns despite his initial defeat at amathus alexander set his focus on gaza
a victory against the city wasnt so easily achieved
gazas general apollodotus strategically employed a night attack against the hasmonean army
with a force of two thousand less skilled soldiers and ten thousand slaves gazas military was able to deceive the hasmonean army into believing they were being attacked by ptolemy
the gazans killed many and the hasmonean army fled the battle
when morning exposed the delusive tactic alexander continued his assault but lost a thousand additional soldiers
the gazans remained defiant in hopes that the nabataean kingdom would come to their aid
the city eventually suffered defeat due to its own leadership
gaza at the time was governed by two brothers lysimachus and apollodotus
lysimachus convinced the people to surrender and alexander peacefully entered the city
though he at first seemed peaceful alexander suddenly turned against the inhabitants
some men killed their wives and children out of desperation to ensure they wouldnt be captured and enslaved
others burned down their homes to prevent the soldiers from plundering
the town council and five hundred civilians took refuge at the temple of apollo where alexander had them massacred
the judean civil war initially began after the conquest of gaza around bce
due to jannaeuss victory at gaza the nabataean kingdom no longer had direct access to the mediterranean sea
alexander soon captured gadara which together with the loss of gaza caused the nabataeans to lose their main trade routes leading to rome and damascus
after losing gadara the nabataean king obodas i launched an attack against alexander in a steep valley at gadara where alexander barely managed to escape
after his defeat in the battle of gadara jannaeus returned to jerusalem and was met with fierce jewish opposition
during the jewish holiday sukkot alexander jannaeus while officiating as the high priest at the temple in jerusalem demonstrated his displeasure against the pharisees by refusing to perform the water libation ceremony properly instead of pouring it on the altar he poured it on his feet
the crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with etrogim
they made the situation worse by insulting him
they called him a descendant of a captive woman and unsuitable to hold office and to sacrifice
outraged he killed six thousand people
alexander also had wooden barriers built around the altar and the temple preventing people from going near him
only the priests were permitted to enter
this incident during the feast of tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the judean civil war
after jannaeus succeeded early in the war the rebels asked for seleucid assistance
judean insurgents joined forces with demetrius iii eucaerus to fight against jannaeus
alexander had gathered six thousand two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand jews for battle
demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses
there were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful
the seleucid forces defeated jannaeus at shechem and all of alexanders mercenaries were killed in battle
this defeat forced alexander to take refuge in the mountains
in sympathy towards jannaeus six thousand judean rebels ultimately returned to him
in fear of this news demetrius withdrew
war between jannaeus and the rebels who returned to him continued
they fought until alexander achieved victory
most of the rebels died in battle while the remaining rebels fled to the city of bethoma until they were defeated
jannaeus had brought the surviving rebels back to jerusalem where he had eight hundred jews primarily pharisees crucified
before their deaths alexander had the rebels wives and children executed before their eyes as jannaeus ate with his concubines
alexander later returned the land he had seized in moab and galaaditis from the nabataeans in order to have them end their support for the jewish rebels
the remaining rebels who numbered eight thousand fled by night in fear of alexander
afterward all rebel hostility ceased and alexanders reign continued undisturbed
from bce alexander continued campaigning in the east
the nabataean king aretas iii managed to defeat alexander in battle
however alexander continued expanding the hasmonean kingdom into transjordan
in gaulanitis he captured the cities of golan seleucia and gamala
in galaaditis the cities of pella dium and gerasa
alexander had pella destroyed because its inhabitants refused to judaize
he is believed to have expanded and fortified the hasmonean palace near jericho
for the last three years of his life alexander jannaeus suffered from the combined effects of alcoholism and quartan ague
after a reign of years he died c
bce at the age of forty nine during the siege of ragaba
in josephuss antiquities he presents an account that differs from his earlier war and syncelluss accounts
according to josephus jannaeus fell fatally ill on the battlefield at ragaba with his wife salome alexandra present
jannaeus instructed her to hide his death until she captured ragaba and to subsequently share power with the pharisees
he also requested that she allow the pharisees to abuse his corpse believing they would then give him an honorable burial despite this request violating deuteronomy
this request is interpreted as jannaeus seeking atonement for previously violating this commandment by abusing the bodies of crucified pharisees
kenneth atkinson writes that josephuss style and wording suggest jannaeus died in jerusalem and never reached ragaba
josephus may have concealed this fact to hide the undignified nature of this death
alexanders reign ended with a significant political decision naming his wife as successor and granting her the authority to appoint the next high priest
the alexandrists were a school of renaissance philosophers who in the great controversy on the subject of personal immortality adopted the explanation of the de anima given by alexander of aphrodisias
according to the orthodox thomism of the catholic church aristotle rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul
against this the averroists led by agostino nifo introduced the modifying theory that universal reason in a sense individualizes itself in each soul and then absorbs the active reason into itself again
these two theories respectively evolved the doctrine of individual and universal immortality or the absorption of the individual into the eternal one
the alexandrists led by pietro pomponazzi assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to aristotle
they held that aristotle considered the soul as a material and therefore a mortal entity which operates during life only under the authority of universal reason
hence the alexandrists denied that aristotle viewed the soul as immortal because in their view since they believed that aristotle viewed the soul as organically connected with the body the dissolution of the latter involves the extinction of the former
alexios i komnenos latinized alexius i comnenus was byzantine emperor from to
inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign alexios was able to curb the byzantine decline and begin the military financial and territorial recovery known as the komnenian restoration
his appeals to western europe for help against the seljuk turks was the catalyst that sparked the first crusade
although he was not the first emperor of the komnenian dynasty it was during his reign that the komnenos family came to full power and initiated a hereditary succession to the throne
the son of john komnenos and a nephew of isaac i komnenos alexios served with distinction under three byzantine emperors
in he led a rebellion against emperor nikephoros iii botaneiates and took the throne for himself
he immediately faced an invasion of western balkans by the normans under robert guiscard and his son bohemond
despite initial defeats alexios secured an alliance with holy roman emperor henry iv and drove back the normans recovering most of byzantine losses by
in he achieved a decisive victory over the pechenegs at the battle of levounion in thrace with the help of cuman allies
later in the s alexios directed his attention towards asia minor most of which had fallen to the seljuk turks
desiring western support he took reconciliatory measures towards the papacy and in his envoys made a formal appeal to pope urban ii at the council of piacenza
at the subsequent council of clermont pope urban formally called the first crusade which began a year after and concluded with much of western anatolia restored to byzantine rule
on alexios death in he was suceeeded by his son john ii komnenos
alexios was the son of john komnenos and anna dalassene and the nephew of isaac i komnenos
alexios father declined the throne on the abdication of isaac who was thus succeeded by constantine x doukas and died as a monk in
alexios and his elder brother manuel komnenos served under romanos iv diogenes with distinction against the seljuk turks
under michael vii doukas parapinakes and nikephoros iii botaneiates he was militarily employed along with his elder brother isaac against rebels in asia minor thrace and in epirus
in western mercenaries led by roussel de bailleul rebelled in asia minor but alexios successfully subdued them by
in he was appointed commander of the field army in the west by nikephoros iii
in this capacity alexios defeated the rebellions of nikephoros bryennios the elder and nikephoros basilakes the first at the battle of kalavrye and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp
alexios was ordered to march against his brother in law nikephoros melissenos in asia minor but refused to fight his kinsman
this did not however lead to a demotion as alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the normans of southern italy led by robert guiscard
while byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition the doukas faction at court approached alexios and convinced him to join a conspiracy against nikephoros iii
the mother of alexios anna dalassene was to play a prominent role in this coup dtat of along with the current empress maria of alania
first married to michael vii doukas and secondly to nikephoros iii botaneiates she was preoccupied with the future of her son by michael vii constantine doukas
nikephoros iii intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives and this resulted in marias ambivalence and alliance with the komnenoi though the real driving force behind this political alliance was anna dalassene
the empress was already closely connected to the komnenoi through marias cousin irenes marriage to isaac komnenos so the komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit
furthermore to aid the conspiracy maria had adopted alexios as her son though she was only five years older than he
maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own alans and her eunuchs who had been instigated by isaac komnenos
given annas tight hold on her family alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval
as a result alexios and constantine marias son were now adoptive brothers and both isaac and alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor
by secretly giving inside information to the komnenoi maria was an invaluable ally
as stated in the alexiad isaac and alexios left constantinople in mid february to raise an army against botaneiates
however when the time came anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the hagia sophia
from there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital while protesting her sons innocence of hostile actions
under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church she deliberately excluded the grandson of botaneiates and his loyal tutor met with alexios and isaac and fled for the forum of constantine
the tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds but anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly
then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from cappadocia who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip
however before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace
anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives her sons were loyal subjects and had learned of a plot by enemies of the komnenoi to have them both blinded and had therefore fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor
she refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the mother of god for protection
this request was granted and anna then manifested her true communicative and leadership capabilities nikephoros iii botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family
straboromanos tried to give anna his cross but for her it was not large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath
she also demanded that the cross be personally sent by botaneiates as a vow of his good faith
he obliged sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross
at the emperors further insistence and for their own protection they took refuge at the convent of petrion where they were eventually joined by maria of bulgaria mother of irene doukaina
botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests
they were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news
anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city she distracted the emperor giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops and she gave a false sense of security to botaneiates that there was no real treasonous plot against him
after bribing the western troops guarding the city isaac and alexios komnenos entered the capital victoriously on april
during this time alexios was rumored to be the lover of empress maria the daughter of king bagrat iv of georgia who had been successively married to michael vii doukas and his successor nikephoros iii botaneiates and who was renowned for her beauty
alexios arranged for maria to stay on the palace grounds and it was thought that he was considering marrying her
however his mother consolidated the doukas family connection by arranging the emperors marriage to irene doukaina granddaughter of the caesar john doukas the uncle of michael vii who would not have supported alexios otherwise
as a measure intended to keep the support of the doukai alexios restored constantine doukas the young son of michael vii and maria as co emperor
this situation changed drastically however when alexios first son john ii komnenos was born in annas engagement to constantine was dissolved and she was moved to the main palace to live with her mother and grandmother
alexios became estranged from maria who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery and constantine doukas was deprived of his status as co emperor
the thirty seven year reign of alexios was full of struggle
at the outset he faced the formidable attack of the normans led by robert guiscard and his son bohemond who took dyrrhachium and corfu and laid siege to larissa in thessaly
alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success
he enhanced his resistance by an agreement with the german king henry iv who in exchange for gold pieces did attack the normans in italy which forced the normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in
he also secured the alliance of henry count of monte santangelo who controlled the gargano peninsula and dated his charters by alexios reign
henrys allegiance would be the last example of byzantine political control on peninsular italy
the norman military danger subsided with the death of guiscard in and the byzantines recovered most of their losses
alexios next had to deal with disturbances in thrace where the heretical sects of the bogomils and the paulicians revolted and made common cause with the pechenegs from beyond the danube
paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during alexios battles with the normans
as soon as the norman threat had passed alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters confiscating their lands
this led to a further revolt near philippopolis and the commander of the field army in the west gregory pakourianos was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle
in the pechenegs raided into thrace and alexios crossed into moesia to retaliate but failed to take dorostolon
during his retreat the emperor was confronted and defeated by the pechenegs who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money
in the pechenegs invaded thrace again while tzachas the brother in law of the sultan of rum launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of constantinople with the pechenegs
alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of cumans with whose help he conquered the pechenegs at levounion in thrace on april
this put an end to the pecheneg threat but in the cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the balkans
led by a pretender claiming to be constantine diogenes a long dead son of the emperor romanos iv the cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern thrace until their leader was eliminated at adrianople
with the balkans more or less pacified alexios could now turn his attention to asia minor which had been almost completely overrun by the seljuq turks
by the time alexios ascended the throne the seljuqs had taken most of asia minor
alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the seljuq camps but these victories were unable to stop the turks altogether
he also got military support from western rulers like robert i count of flanders returning from an armed pilgrimage to jerusalem in spending time assisting the byzantine emperor against the turks
in one battle robert and three of his companions rode ahead of the main army charging the forces under the command of kerbogha whose forces were scattered completely
as early as alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the papacy with the intention of seeking western support against the seljuqs
in his ambassadors appeared before pope urban ii at the council of piacenza
the help he sought from the west was some mercenary forces not the immense hosts that arrived to his consternation and embarrassment after the pope preached the first crusade at the council of clermont later that same year
this was the peoples crusade a mob of mostly unarmed poor peasants and serfs led by the preacher peter the hermit fleeing from hunger in their home regions to a promised land of milk and honey
not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories the emperor saw his balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies
eventually alexios dealt with the peoples crusade by hustling them on to asia minor
there they were massacred by the turks of kilij arslan i at the battle of civetot in october
the princes crusade the second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to constantinople led in sections by godfrey of bouillon bohemond of taranto raymond iv of toulouse and other important members of the western nobility
alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the byzantine empire
transferring each contingent into asia alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage
the crusade was a notable success for byzantium as alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands
the siege of nicaea by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in and the subsequent crusader victory at dorylaion allowed the byzantine forces to recover much of western asia minor
john doukas re established byzantine rule in chios rhodes smyrna ephesus sardis and philadelphia in
this success is ascribed by alexios daughter anna to his policy and diplomacy but by the latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception
in a byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing laodicea and other coastal towns as far as tripoli
the crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the byzantine contingent under tatikios failed to help them during the siege of antioch bohemund who had set himself up as prince of antioch briefly went to war with alexios in the balkans but he was blockaded by the byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of alexios by the treaty of deabolis in
around this time in the twenty fifth year of his reign hesychius of miletus records that the sky suddenly darkened and a violent southern wind blew the great statue of constantine at the strategion from its column killing a number of men and women nearby
in though already terminally ill alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in bithynia and mysia to defend his anatolian territories against the inroads of malik shah the seljuq sultan of iconium
in he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the turkish dominated anatolian plateau where he defeated the seljuq sultan at the battle of philomelion
during the last twenty years of his life alexios lost much of his popularity
the years were marked by persecution of the followers of the paulician and bogomil heresies one of his last acts was publicly to burn at the stake basil a bogomil leader with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute
in spite of the success of the first crusade alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the seljuqs in
alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an eminence grise his mother anna dalassene a wise and immensely able politician whom in a uniquely irregular fashion he had crowned as augusta instead of the rightful claimant to the title his wife irene doukaina
anna dalassenes ability to help him seize power and control the aristocracy as well as her ability to understand and resolve dilemmas assured alexius that her mother was a capable counsel and managing partner by his side and a sane and trusted regent in his absence
alexios was never happier than when taking part in military exercises and he assumed personal command of his troops whenever possible
as such dalassene was the effective administrator of the empire during alexios long absences in military campaigns she was constantly at odds with her daughter in law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter anna komnene
alexios last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession
although he had crowned his son john ii komnenos co emperor at the age of five in his wife irene doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of their daughter anna and annas husband nikephoros bryennios the younger
apart from all of his external enemies a host of rebels also sought to overthrow alexios from the imperial throne thereby posing another major threat to his reign
due to the troubled times the empire was enduring he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the byzantine emperors
these included under alexios the debased solidus was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness was established in commonly called the hyperpyron at grs
the hyperpyron was slightly smaller than the solidus
it was introduced along with the electrum aspron trachy worth a third of a hyperpyron and about gold and silver the billon aspron trachy or stamenon valued at to the hyperpyron and with silver wash and the copper tetarteron and noummion worth and to the billon aspron trachy
alexios i had overcome dangerous crises and stabilized the byzantine empire inaugurating a century of imperial prosperity and success
he had also profoundly altered the nature of the byzantine government
by seeking close alliances with powerful noble families alexios put an end to the tradition of imperial exclusivity and co opted most of the nobility into his extended family and through it his government
those who did not become part of this extended family were deprived of power and prestige
this measure which was intended to diminish opposition was paralleled by the introduction of new courtly dignities like that of panhypersebastos given to nikephoros bryennios or that of sebastokrator given to the emperors brother isaac komnenos
although this policy met with initial success it gradually undermined the relative effectiveness of imperial bureaucracy by placing family connections over merit
alexios policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity every byzantine emperor who reigned after alexios i komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage
alexis was a greek comic poet of the middle comedy period
he was born in thurii in magna graecia and taken early to athens where he became a citizen being enrolled in the deme oion and the tribe leontides
it is thought he lived to the age of and died on the stage while being crowned
according to the suda a th century encyclopedia alexis was the paternal uncle of the dramatist menander and wrote comedies of which only fragments now survive including some preserved titles
he appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table according to athenaeus
he had a son named stephanus who was also a comic poet
he won his first lenaean victory in the s bc most likely where he was sixth after eubulus and fourth after antiphanes
while being a middle comic poet alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of new comedy such as philippides philemon diphilus and even menander
there is also some evidence that during his old age he wrote plays in the style of new comedy
plutarch says that he lived to the age of and months and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor
he was certainly alive after bc for aeschines mentions him as alive in that year
he was also living at least as late as bc from which his birth date is calculated
according to the suda he wrote comedies of which only fragments including some titles survive
his plays include meropis ankylion olympiodoros parasitos agonis and the adelphoi and the stratiotes in which he satirized demosthenes and acted shortly after bc
also hippos pyraunos pharmakopole hypobolimaios and ankylion
because he wrote a lot of plays the same passages often appear in more than plays
it was said that he also borrowed from eubulus and many other playwrights in some of his plays
according to carytius of pergamum alexis was the first to use the part of the parasite
alexis was known in roman times aulus gellius noted that alexis poetry was used by roman comedians including turpilius and possibly plautus
only fragments have survived from any of alexiss plays about in all totaling about lines
they attest to the authors wit and refinement which athenaeus praises
the surviving fragments also show that alexis invented a great many words mostly compound words that he used normal words in an unusual way and made strange and unusual forms of common words
the main sources of the fragments of alexis are stobaeus and athenaeus
alexios ii komnenos latinized alexius ii comnenus was byzantine emperor from to
he ascended to the throne as a minor
for the duration of his short reign the imperial power was de facto held by regents
born in the purple at constantinople alexios was the long awaited son of emperor manuel i komnenos and maria of antioch
in he was crowned co emperor and in he accompanied his father at dorylaion in asia minor in order to have the city rebuilt
on march at the age of eleven he was married to agnes of france aged daughter of king louis vii of france
she was thereafter known as anna and after alexios murder three years later anna would be remarried to the person responsible andronikos then aged
when manuel i died in september alexios ii succeeded him as emperor
at this time however he was an uneducated boy with only amusement in mind
the imperial regency was then undertaken by the dowager empress and the prtosebastos alexios komnenos who was popularly believed to be her lover
the regents depleted the imperial treasury by granting privileges to italian merchants and to the byzantine aristocracy
when bla iii of hungary and kilij arslan ii of rum began raiding within the byzantine western and eastern borders respectively the regents were forced to ask for help to the pope and to saladin
furthermore a party supporting alexios iis right to reign led by his half sister maria komnene and her husband the caesar john stirred up riots in the streets of the capital
the regents managed to defeat the party on april but andronikos komnenos a first cousin of manuel i took advantage of the disorder to aim at the crown
he entered constantinople received with almost divine honours and overthrew the government
his arrival was celebrated by a massacre of the latins in constantinople especially the venetian merchants which he made no attempt to stop
on may andronikos posing as alexios protector officially restored him on the throne
as for the young emperor was uninterested in ruling matters and andronikos effectively acted as the power behind the throne not allowing alexios any voice in public affairs
one after another andronikos suppressed most of alexios defenders and supporters his half sister maria komnene the caesar john his loyal generals andronikos doukas angelos andronikos kontostephanos and john komnenos vatatzes while empress dowager maria was put in prison
in alexios was compelled to condemn his own mother to death
in september andronikos was formally proclaimed emperor before the crowd on the terrace of the church of christ of the chalk
probably by the end of the same month andronikos ordered alexios assassination the young emperor was secretly strangled with a bow string and his body thrown in the bsporos
in the years following alexios mysterious disappearance many young men resembling him tried to claim the throne
in the end none of those pseudo alexioi managed to become emperor
alexios is a character in the historical novel agnes of france by greek writer kostas kyriazis
the novel describes the events of the reigns of manuel i alexios ii and andronikos i through the eyes of agnes
alexios iii angelos latinized as alexius iii angelus was byzantine emperor from march to july
he reigned under the name alexios komnenos associating himself with the komnenos dynasty
a member of the extended imperial family alexios came to the throne after deposing blinding and imprisoning his younger brother isaac ii angelos
the most significant event of his reign was the attack of the fourth crusade on constantinople in on behalf of alexios iv angelos
alexios iii took over the defence of the city which he mismanaged and then fled the city at night with one of his three daughters
from adrianople and then mosynopolis he attempted unsuccessfully to rally his supporters only to end up a captive of marquis boniface of montferrat
he was ransomed and sent to asia minor where he plotted against his son in law theodore i laskaris but was eventually captured and spent his last days confined to the monastery of hyakinthos in nicaea where he died
alexios iii was the second son of andronikos doukas angelos and euphrosyne kastamonitissa
andronikos was himself a son of theodora komnene the youngest daughter of emperor alexios i komnenos and irene doukaina
thus alexios iii was a member of the extended imperial family
together with his father and brothers alexios had conspired against emperor andronikos i komnenos and thus he spent several years in exile in muslim courts including that of saladin
his younger brother isaac ii was threatened with execution under orders of andronikos i their first cousin once removed on september
isaac made a desperate attack on the imperial agents and soon killed their leader stephen hagiochristophorites
he then took refuge in the church of hagia sophia and from there appealed to the populace
his actions provoked a riot which resulted in the deposition of andronikos i and the proclamation of isaac as emperor
alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before
by alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother from whom he received the elevated title of sebastokratr
in march while isaac ii was away hunting in thrace alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of his wife euphrosyne doukaina kamatera
alexios captured isaac at stagira in macedonia put out his eyes and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner despite having previously been redeemed by alexios from captivity at antioch and showered with honours
to compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the empire practically defenceless
these actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state
at christmas holy roman emperor henry vi attempted to force alexios to pay him a tribute of pounds of gold or face invasion
alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the holy apostles and heavily taxing the people through the alamanikon
because of henrys death in september the gold was never dispatched
the empress euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court vatatzes the favourite instrument in her attempts at reform was assassinated by the emperors orders
in the east the empire was overrun by the seljuk turks from the north the kingdom of hungary and the rebellious bulgarians and vlachs descended unchecked to ravage the balkan provinces of the empire sometimes penetrating as far as greece while alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means
the emperors attempts to bolster the empires defences by special concessions to pronoiai in the frontier zone backfired as the latter increased their regional autonomy
byzantine authority survived but in a much weakened state
in local lord dobromir chrysos established himself in the region of vardar macedonia defying the imperial power for several years
during the first years of alexios reign relations between byzantium and serbia were good since his daughter eudokia angelina was married to serbian grand prince stefan nemanji ii who was granted the title of sebastokrator
but in those relations deteriorated
the marriage between stefan and eudokia was dissolved and the alliance between serbia and byzantium ended leaving byzantium without a single ally in southeastern europe
soon alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger
in soldiers assembled at venice to launch the fourth crusade
alexios iv angelos the son of the deposed isaac ii had recently escaped from constantinople and now appealed for support to the crusaders promising to end the east west schism to pay for their transport and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his fathers throne
the crusaders whose objective had been egypt were persuaded to set their course for constantinople arriving there in june proclaiming alexios iv as emperor and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle
alexios iii took no effective measures to resist and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed
his son in law theodore i laskaris who was the only one to attempt anything significant was defeated at scutari and the siege of constantinople began
misgovernment by alexios iii had left the byzantine navy with only worm eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived
in july the crusaders led by the aged doge enrico dandolo scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city
in the ensuing fighting the crusaders set the city on fire ultimately leaving people homeless
on july alexios iii finally took action and led divisions from the gate of st
romanus vastly outnumbering the crusaders
his courage failed however and the byzantine army returned to the city without a fight
his courtiers demanded action and alexios iii promised to fight
instead that night alexios iii hid in the palace and finally with one of his daughters eirene and as much treasure as he could collect got into a boat and escaped to develtos in thrace leaving his wife and his other daughters behind
isaac ii drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple received his son alexios iv in state
alexios iii attempted to organize resistance to the new regime from adrianople and then mosynopolis where he was joined by the later usurper alexios v doukas in april after the definitive fall of constantinople to the crusaders and the establishment of the latin empire
at first alexios iii received alexios v well even allowing him to marry his daughter eudokia angelina
later alexios v was blinded and deserted by his father in law who fled from the crusaders into thessaly
here alexios iii eventually surrendered with euphrosyne to marquis boniface of montferrat who was establishing himself as ruler of the kingdom of thessalonica
alexios iii attempted to escape bonifaces protection in seeking shelter with michael i komnenos doukas the ruler of epirus
captured by boniface alexios and his retinue were sent to montferrat before being brought back to thessalonica in
at that point the deposed emperor was ransomed by michael i who sent him to asia minor where alexios son in law theodore now emperor of nicaea was holding his own against the latins
here alexios conspired against his son in law after the latter refused to recognize alexios authority receiving the support of kaykhusraw i the sultan of rm
in the battle of antioch on the meander in the sultan was defeated and killed and alexios was captured by theodore
alexios was then confined to a monastery at nicaea where he died later in
alexios v doukas latinized as alexius v ducas was byzantine emperor from february to april just prior to the sack of constantinople by the participants of the fourth crusade
his family name was doukas but he was also known by the nickname mourtzouphlos or murtzuphlus referring to either bushy overhanging eyebrows or a sullen gloomy character
he achieved power through a palace coup killing his predecessors in the process
though he made vigorous attempts to defend constantinople from the crusader army his military efforts proved ineffective
his actions won the support of the mass of the populace but he alienated the elite of the city
following the fall sack and occupation of the city alexios v was blinded by his father in law the ex emperor alexios iii and later executed by the new latin regime
he was the last byzantine emperor to rule in constantinople until the byzantine recapture of constantinople in
though in possession of the surname used by a leading byzantine aristocratic family there is very little definitely known concerning the ancestry of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos
the noble doukas clan were not the only doukai as the surname was also employed by many families of humble origins
it has been claimed that alexios doukas was a great great grandson of the emperor alexios i komnenos in the female line
this is not improbable as all other byzantine emperors and the majority of attempted usurpers of the period had a connection with the former imperial house of the komnenoi either by descent or marriage
a more precise theory has been proposed that he was the son of an isaac doukas and was the second cousin of alexios iv angelos
his date of birth is also unknown but it is sometimes given as because he was considered old in
a letter sent to pope innocent iii stated that alexios doukas mourtzouphlos was a blood relation of alexios iv angelos
the contemporary historian niketas choniates was dismissed from office as logothete of the sekreta by mourtzouphlos
his assessment of the emperors character might therefore be biased however choniates allows that he was extremely clever by nature though arrogant in his manner and lecherous
the participation of alexios doukas mourtzouphlos in the attempted overthrow of alexios iii angelos by john komnenos the fat in had led to his imprisonment
mourtzouphlos was probably imprisoned from until the restoration to the throne of isaac ii angelos the brother and predecessor of alexios iii
isaac ii along with his son alexios iv angelos were restored to the throne through the intervention of the leaders of the fourth crusade in july
on release mourtzouphlos was invested with the court position of protovestiarios
he had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of eudokia angelina a daughter of alexios iii
by the beginning of isaac ii and alexios iv had inspired little confidence among the people of constantinople with their efforts to protect the city from the latin crusaders and their venetian allies and the citizens were becoming restless
the crusaders were also losing patience with the emperors they rioted and set fires in the city when the money and aid promised by alexios iv was not forthcoming
the fires affected about a sixth of the area of constantinople and may have made up to a third of the population homeless the dislocation and desperation of those affected eventually sapped the will of the people to resist the crusaders
alexios doukas mourtzouphlos emerged as a leader of the anti latin movement in the city
he won the approval of the populace by his valour in leading an attack on the latins at trypetos lithos in this clash his mount stumbled and he would have been killed or captured had a band of youthful archers from the city not defended him
mourtzouphlos exploited the hatred of the people for the latins to serve his personal ambition
the citizens of constantinople rebelled in late january and in the chaos an otherwise obscure nobleman named nicholas kanabos was acclaimed emperor though he was unwilling to accept the crown
the two co emperors barricaded themselves in the palace of blachernae and entrusted mourtzouphlos with a mission to seek help from the crusaders or at least they informed him of their intentions
instead of contacting the crusaders mourtzouphlos on the night of january used his access to the palace to bribe the ax bearers and with their backing arrest the emperors
choniates states that mourtzouphlos when bribing the guards had the help of a eunuch with access to the imperial treasury
the support of the varangians seems to have been of major importance in the success of the coup though mourtzouphlos also had help from his relations and associates
the young alexios iv was eventually strangled in prison while his father isaac both enfeebled and blind died at around the time of the coup his death variously attributed to fright sorrow or mistreatment
kanabos was initially spared and offered an office under alexios v but he refused both this and a further summons from the emperor and took sanctuary in the hagia sophia he was forcibly removed and killed on the steps of the cathedral
the timing of the deaths of the deposed emperors and of kanabos and their relation to the coronation of alexios v are problematic
alexios v appears to have been acclaimed emperor as early as the night he moved against the angeloi co emperors on january
he was crowned soon after on or around february
finding the treasury empty the new emperor confiscated money from the aristocracy and high officials to be put to public use
these actions endeared alexios v to the citizens but alienated his relations and other prominent supporters
once in firm control alexios v closed the gates of the city to the crusaders and strengthened the fortifications
sword in hand he was active in leading attacks on sorties made by the crusaders in search of supplies
on february henry of flanders led a part of the crusader army to filea in order to obtain food supplies
as he returned towards constantinople alexios v attacked his rearguard
the byzantines were defeated the imperial standard and an important icon of the virgin were captured
the byzantines lost some of their best soldiers in the clash and alexios v was lucky to escape alive
at about this time alexios v attempted to destroy the crusader fleet with fire ships but to little effect
the loss of the icon traditionally seen as a physical embodiment of divine protection for the city was a severe psychological blow
its possession by the crusaders convinced many of the population of constantinople that the victory of the westerners was now divinely sanctioned as a punishment for the sins of the byzantines
around february alexios v met the doge of venice enrico dandolo for peace talks
the conditions demanded by the venetian however were too harsh for the byzantines to consider
choniates states that the meeting was brought to a close by a sudden attack by crusader cavalry on alexios v and his entourage the emperor narrowly escaping capture
alexios iv was probably killed the same day the insistence by the crusaders that he be restored to the throne may have precipitated his death
when news of the death of alexios iv reached the crusaders relations between them and alexios v deteriorated further
the forcible expulsion of all latins resident in constantinople in march seems to have been the tipping point which led the crusaders to begin actively negotiating amongst themselves regarding the partition of the byzantine empire
they also began to prepare for their final assault on the city which took place the following month
the defenders of constantinople held out against a crusader assault on april
the crusaders second attack three days later however proved too strong to repel
breaking through the walls near the petria gate the crusaders entered the city and looted the blachernae palace
alexios v attempted to rally the people to the defence of the city but with no success
alexios v then boarded a fishing boat and fled the city towards thrace on the night of april accompanied by eudokia angelina and her mother euphrosyne doukaina kamatera
in the hagia sophia constantine laskaris was acclaimed as emperor but being unable to persuade the varangians to continue the fight in the early hours of april he also fled leaving constantinople under crusader control
alexios v and his companions eventually reached mosynopolis which had been occupied by the deposed emperor alexios iii angelos and his followers
at first they were well received with alexios v marrying eudokia angelina
later however alexios iii arranged for his new son in law to be made captive and blinded thereby rendering him ineligible for the imperial throne
having been abandoned by both his supporters and his father in law alexios v was captured near mosynopolis or possibly in anatolia by the advancing latins under thierry de loos in november
on his return to constantinople as a prisoner alexios v was tried for treason against alexios iv
in his trial the blind ex emperor argued that it was alexios iv who had committed treason to his country through his intention to invite the crusaders to enter constantinople in force
on being condemned he was executed by novel means he was thrown to his death from the top of the column of theodosius
the new alien latin regime of conquerors in constantinople may have viewed the public trial and execution of the man who murdered the last legitimate emperor as a way to cast an aura of legitimacy on themselves
alexios v was the last byzantine emperor to reign in constantinople before the establishment of the latin empire which controlled the city for the next years until it was recovered by the nicaean emperor michael viii palaiologos in
grand duke alexei petrovich of russia was a russian tsarevich
he was born in moscow the son of tsar peter i and his first wife eudoxia lopukhina
alexei despised his father and repeatedly thwarted peters plans to raise him as successor to the throne to continue his policies
his brief defection to austria scandalized the russian government leading to harsh reprisals against alexei and his associates
alexei died after interrogation under torture and his younger half brother peter petrovich became the new heir apparent
the young alexei was brought up by his mother who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards his father the tsar
alexeis relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mothers worst persecutor
from the ages of to alexei was educated by his tutor vyazemsky but after the removal of his mother by peter the great to the alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners who taught him history geography mathematics and french
in alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in an artillery regiment
in he was present at the capture of narva
at this period the preceptors of the tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability
alexei had strong leanings towards archaeology and ecclesiology
however peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new russia and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain russias new wealth and power
painful relations between father and son quite apart from the prior personal antipathies were therefore inevitable
it was an additional misfortune for alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood
he was left in the hands of reactionary boyars and priests who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the tsar
in peter sent alexei to smolensk to collect supplies and recruits and after that to moscow to fortify it against charles xii of sweden
at the end of alexei went to dresden for one year
there he finished lessons in french german mathematics and fortification
after his education alexei married princess charlotte of brunswick wolfenbttel whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of europe
he met with princess charlotte both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward
in theory alexei could have refused the marriage and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended
why havent you written to tell me what you thought about her wrote peter in a letter dated august
the marriage contract was signed in september
the wedding was celebrated at torgau germany on october
one of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the orthodox faith charlotte herself was allowed to retain her protestant faith an agreement opposed by alexeis followers
as for the marriage itself the first months went well but quickly became a failure within the next months
alexei was drunk constantly and pronounced his bride pock marked and too thin
he insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public
three weeks later the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to toru to superintend the provisioning of the russian troops in poland
for the next twelve months alexei was kept constantly on the move
his wife joined him at toru in december but in april a peremptory ukase ordered him off to the army in pomerania and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through finland
peter alexeyevich would succeed as the emperor peter ii in
with his death in the direct male line of the house of romanov became extinct
after the birth of natalia in alexei brought his long time finnish serf mistress afrosinia to live in the palace
some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbases disapproval of his foreign non orthodox bride more so than her appearance that caused alexei to spurn charlotte
another influence was alexander kikin a high placed official who had fallen out with the tsar and had been deprived of his estates
immediately on his return from finland alexei was dispatched by his father to staraya russa and lake ladoga to see to the building of new ships
this was the last commission entrusted to him since peter had not been satisfied with his sons performance and his lack of enthusiasm
when peter asked alexei to show his progress in mechanics and mathematics the son responded by shooting himself in the right hand and peter took no more interest in him
nevertheless peter made one last effort to reclaim his son
on october charlotte died after giving birth to a son the grand duke peter the future emperor peter ii
on the day of the funeral peter sent alexei a stern letter urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state
peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his fathers plans
alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son peter
peter would agree but on the condition that alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk
while alexei was pondering his options on august peter wrote from abroad urging him if he desired to remain tsarevich to join him and the army without delay
rather than face this ordeal alexei fled to vienna and placed himself under the protection of his brother in law the emperor charles vi who sent him for safety first to the tirolean fortress of ehrenberg and finally to the castle of santelmo at naples
he was accompanied throughout his journey by afrosinia
that the emperor sincerely sympathized with alexei and suspected peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son is plain from his confidential letter to george i of great britain whom he consulted on this delicate affair
peter felt insulted the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal and he had to be recovered and brought back to russia at all costs
this difficult task was accomplished by count peter tolstoi the most subtle and unscrupulous of peters servants
alexei would only consent to return if his father swore that if he came back he would not be punished and would be allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry afrosinia
on january the tsarevich reached moscow
peter had already determined to institute an inquisition in order to understand the reasons for alexeis flight
on february a confession was extorted from alexei which implicated most of his friends and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand duke peter alexeyevich
a brutal reign of terror ensued in the course of which the ex tsaritsa eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged adultery
friends of alexei were impaled broken on the wheel or otherwise tortured to death
alexeis servants were beheaded or had their tongues cut out
all this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich
in april fresh confessions were extorted from and in regard to alexei
this included the words of afrosinia who had turned states evidence
i shall bring back the old people
alexei is reported to have told her and choose myself new ones according to my will when i become sovereign i shall live in moscow and leave saint petersburg simply as any other town i wont launch any ships i shall maintain troops only for defense and wont make war on anyone i shall be content with the old domains
in winter i shall live in moscow and in summer in iaroslavl
despite this and other hearsay evidence there was no direct evidence
the worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his fathers death
in the eyes of peter his son was now a self convicted and dangerous traitor whose life was forfeit
however his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to russia
the whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of prelates senators ministers and other dignitaries on june
the clergy for their part declared that the tsarevich alexei
had placed his confidence in those who loved the ancient customs and that he had become acquainted with them by the discourses they held wherein they had constantly praised the ancient manners and spoke with distaste of the novelties his father had introduced
declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter the clergy left the matter to the tsars own decision
at noon on june the temporal dignitaries the members of both the senate and magistrates that comprised the court declared alexei guilty and sentenced him to death
still peter was so desperate to uncover any possible collusion that the examination by torture continued
on june the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty five strokes with the knout and then on june he was subject to fifteen more
on june alexei died in the peter and paul fortress in saint petersburg two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother in law emperor charles vi

andrew jackson was born on march in the waxhaws region of the carolinas
his parents were scots irish colonists andrew jackson and elizabeth hutchinson presbyterians who had emigrated from ulster ireland in
jacksons father was born in carrickfergus county antrim around and his ancestors had crossed into northern ireland from scotland after the battle of the boyne in
jackson had two older brothers who came with his parents from ireland hugh and robert
elizabeth had a strong hatred of the british that she passed on to her sons
jacksons exact birthplace is unclear
jacksons father died at the age of in a logging accident while clearing land in february three weeks before his son andrew was born
afterwards elizabeth and her three sons moved in with her sister and brother in law jane and james crawford
jackson later stated that he was born on the crawford plantation which is in lancaster county south carolina but second hand evidence suggests that he might have been born at another uncles home in north carolina
when jackson was young elizabeth thought he might become a minister and paid to have him schooled by a local clergyman
he learned to read write work with numbers and was exposed to greek and latin but he was too strong willed and hot tempered for the ministry
jackson and his older brothers hugh and robert served on the patriot side against british forces during the american revolutionary war

robert died two days after arriving home but elizabeth was able to nurse andrew back to health
once he recovered elizabeth volunteered to nurse american prisoners of war housed in british prison ships in the harbor of charleston south carolina
she contracted cholera and died soon afterwards
the war made jackson an orphan at age and increased his hatred for the values he associated with britain in particular aristocracy and political privilege
after the american revolutionary war jackson worked as a saddler briefly returned to school and taught reading and writing to children
in he left the waxhaws region for salisbury north carolina where he studied law under attorney spruce macay
he completed his training under john stokes and was admitted to the north carolina bar in september
shortly thereafter his friend john mcnairy helped him get appointed as a prosecuting attorney in the western district of north carolina which would later become the state of tennessee
while traveling to assume his new position jackson stopped in jonesborough
while there he bought his first slave a woman who was around his age
he also fought his first duel accusing another lawyer waightstill avery of impugning his character
the duel ended with both men firing in the air

the state legislature elected him to be a us senator in but he resigned after serving only six months
in the spring of governor john sevier appointed jackson to be a judge of the tennessee superior court
in he also became major general or commander of the tennessee militia a position that was determined by a vote of the militias officers
the vote was tied between jackson and sevier a popular revolutionary war veteran and former governor but the governor archibald roane broke the tie in jacksons favor
jackson later accused sevier of fraud and bribery
sevier responded by impugning rachels honor resulting in a shootout on a public street
soon afterwards they met to duel but parted without having fired at each other
jackson resigned his judgeship in
he had almost gone bankrupt when the land and mercantile speculations he had made on the basis of promissory notes fell apart in the wake of an earlier financial panic
he had to sell hunters hill as well as of land he bought for speculation and bought a smaller plantation near nashville that he would call the hermitage
he focused on recovering from his losses by becoming a successful planter and merchant
the hermitage would grow to making it one of the largest cotton growing plantations in the state
like most planters in the southern united states jackson used slave labor
in jackson had nine african american slaves by he had over and by his death in he had over
over his lifetime he owned a total of slaves
jackson subscribed to the paternalistic idea of slavery which claimed that slave ownership was morally acceptable as long as slaves were treated with humanity and their basic needs were cared for
in practice slaves were treated as a form of wealth whose productivity needed to be protected
jackson directed harsh punishment for slaves who disobeyed or ran away
for example in an advertisement to recover a runaway slave he offered ten dollars extra for every hundred lashes any person will give him up to three hundred lashes a number that would likely have been deadly
jackson also participated in the local slave trade
over time his accumulation of wealth in both slaves and land placed him among the elite families of tennessee
in may jackson fought a duel with charles dickinson
they had gotten into an argument over a horse race and dickinson allegedly uttered a slur against rachel
during the duel dickinson fired first and the bullet hit jackson in the chest
the wound was not life threatening because the bullet had shattered against his breastbone
jackson returned fire and killed dickinson
the killing tarnished jacksons reputation
later that year jackson became involved in former vice president aaron burrs plan to conquer spanish florida and drive the spanish from texas
burr who was touring what was then the western united states after mortally wounding alexander hamilton in a duel stayed with the jacksons at the hermitage in
he eventually persuaded jackson to join his adventure
in october jackson wrote james winchester that the united states can conquer not only but all spanish north america
he informed the tennessee militia that it should be ready to march at a moments notice when the government and constituted authority of our country require it and agreed to provide boats and provisions for the expedition
jackson sent a letter to president thomas jefferson telling him that tennessee was ready to defend the nations honor
jackson also expressed uncertainty about the enterprise
he warned the governor of louisiana william claiborne and tennessee senator daniel smith that some of the people involved in the adventure might be intending to break away from the united states
in december jefferson ordered burr to be arrested for treason
jackson safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail organized the militia to capture the conspirators
he testified before a grand jury in implying that it was burrs associate james wilkinson who was guilty of treason not burr
burr was acquitted of the charges
on june the united states declared war on the united kingdom launching the war of
though the war was primarily caused by maritime issues it provided white american settlers on the southern frontier the opportunity to overcome native american resistance to settlement undermine british support of the native american tribes and pry florida from the spanish empire
jackson immediately offered to raise volunteers for the war but he was not called to duty until after the united states military was repeatedly defeated in the american northwest
after these defeats in january jackson enlisted over volunteers who were ordered to head to new orleans to defend against a british attack
when his forces arrived at natchez they were ordered to halt by general wilkinson the commander at new orleans and the man jackson accused of treason after the burr adventure
a little later jackson received a letter from the secretary of war john armstrong stating that his volunteers were not needed and that they were to hand over any supplies to wilkinson and disband
jackson refused to disband his troops instead he led them on the difficult march back to nashville earning the nickname hickory for his toughness
after returning to nashville jackson and one of his colonels john coffee got into a street brawl over honor with the brothers jesse and thomas hart benton
nobody was killed but jackson received a gunshot in the shoulder that nearly killed him
jackson had not fully recovered from his wounds when governor willie blount called out the militia in september following the august fort mims massacre
the red sticks a confederate faction that had allied with tecumseh a shawnee chief who was fighting with the british against the united states killed about militia men and civilians at fort mims in retaliation for an ambush by american militia at burnt corn creek
jacksons objective was to destroy the red sticks
he headed south from fayetteville tennessee in october with militia establishing fort strother as his supply base
he sent his cavalry under general coffee ahead of the main force destroying red stick villages and capturing supplies
coffee defeated a band of red sticks at the battle of tallushatchee on november and jackson defeated another band later that month at the battle of talladega
by january the expiration of enlistments and desertion had reduced jacksons force by about volunteers but he continued the offensive
the red sticks counterattacked at the battles of emuckfaw and enotachopo creek
jackson repelled them but was forced to withdraw to fort strother
jacksons army was reinforced by further recruitment and the addition of a regular army unit the th us infantry regiment
the combined force of men including cherokee choctaw and creek allies attacked a red stick fort at horseshoe bend on the tallapoosa river which was manned by about men
the red sticks were overwhelmed and massacred
almost all their warriors were killed and nearly women and children were taken prisoner and distributed to jacksons native american allies
the victory broke the power of the red sticks
jackson continued his scorched earth campaign of burning villages destroying supplies and starving red stick women and children
the campaign ended when william weatherford the red stick leader surrendered although some red sticks fled to east florida
on june jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the united states army and days later was made a brevet major general with command of the seventh military district which included tennessee louisiana the mississippi territory and the muscogee creek confederacy
with president james madisons approval jackson imposed the treaty of fort jackson
the treaty required all creek including those who had remained allies to surrender of land to the united states
jackson then turned his attention to the british and spanish
he moved his forces to mobile alabama in august accused the spanish governor of west florida mateo gonzlez manrique of arming the red sticks and threatened to attack
the governor responded by inviting the british to land at pensacola to defend it which violated spanish neutrality
the british attempted to capture mobile but their invasion fleet was repulsed at fort bowyer
jackson then invaded florida defeating the spanish and british forces at the battle of pensacola on november
afterwards the spanish surrendered and the british withdrew
weeks later jackson learned that the british were planning an attack on new orleans which was the gateway to the lower mississippi river and control of the american west
he evacuated pensacola strengthened the garrison at mobile and led his troops to new orleans
jackson arrived in new orleans on december
there he instituted martial law because he worried about the loyalty of the citys creole and spanish inhabitants
he augmented his force by forming an alliance with jean lafittes smugglers and raising units of free african americans and creek paying non white volunteers the same salary as whites
this gave jackson a force of about men when the british arrived
the british arrived in new orleans in mid december
admiral alexander cochrane was the overall commander of the operation general edward pakenham commanded the army of soldiers many of whom had served in the napoleonic wars
as the british advanced up the east bank of the mississippi river jackson constructed a fortified position to block them
the climactic battle took place on january when the british launched a frontal assault
their troops made easy targets for the americans protected by their parapets and the attack ended in disaster
the british suffered over casualties to the americans
the british decamped from new orleans at the end of january but they still remained a threat
jackson refused to lift martial law and kept the militia under arms
he approved the execution of six militiamen for desertion
some creoles registered as french citizens with the french consul and demanded to be discharged from the militia due to their foreign nationality
jackson then ordered all french citizens to leave the city within three days and had a member of the louisiana legislature louis louaillier arrested when he wrote a newspaper article criticizing jacksons continuation of martial law
us district court judge dominic a
hall signed a writ of habeas corpus for louailliers release
jackson had hall arrested too
a military court ordered louailliers release but jackson kept him in prison and evicted hall from the city
although jackson lifted martial law when he received official word that the treaty of ghent which ended the war with the british had been signed his previous behavior tainted his reputation in new orleans
jacksons victory made him a national hero and on february he was given the thanks of congress and awarded a congressional gold medal
though the treaty of ghent had been signed in december before the battle of new orleans was fought jacksons victory assured that the united states control of the region between mobile and new orleans would not be effectively contested by european powers
this control allowed the american government to ignore one of the articles in the treaty which would have returned the creek lands taken in the treaty of fort jackson
following the war jackson remained in command of troops in the southern half of the united states and was permitted to make his headquarters at the hermitage
jackson continued to displace the native americans in areas under his command
despite resistance from secretary of the treasury william crawford he signed five treaties between and in which the creek choctaw cherokee and chickasaw ceded tens of millions of acres of land to the united states
these included the treaty of tuscaloosa and the treaty of doaks stand
jackson soon became embroiled in conflict in florida
the former british post at prospect bluff which became known to americans as the negro fort remained occupied by more than a thousand former soldiers of the british royal and colonial marines escaped slaves and various indigenous peoples
it had become a magnet for escapees and was seen as a threat to the property rights of american enslavers even a potential source of insurrection by enslaved people
jackson ordered colonel duncan clinch to capture the fort in july
he destroyed it and killed many of the garrison
some survivors were enslaved while others fled into the wilderness of florida
white american settlers were in constant conflict with native american people collectively known as the seminoles who straddled the border between the us and florida
in december secretary of war john c
calhoun initiated the first seminole war by ordering jackson to lead a campaign with full power to conduct the war as he may think best
jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize florida from spain once and for all
before departing jackson wrote to president james monroe let it be signified to me through any channel
that the possession of the floridas would be desirable to the united states and in sixty days it will be accomplished
jackson invaded florida captured the spanish fort of st
marks and occupied pensacola
seminole and spanish resistance was effectively ended by may
he also captured two british subjects robert ambrister and alexander arbuthnot who had been working with the seminoles
after a brief trial jackson executed both of them causing an international incident with the british
jacksons actions polarized monroes cabinet
the occupied territories were returned to spain
calhoun wanted him censured for violating the constitution since the united states had not declared war on spain
secretary of state john quincy adams defended him as he thought jacksons occupation of pensacola would lead spain to sell florida which spain did in the adams ons treaty of
in february a congressional investigation exonerated jackson and his victory was instrumental in convincing the seminoles to sign the treaty of moultrie creek in which surrendered much of their land in florida
the panic of the united states first prolonged financial depression caused congress to reduce the militarys size and abolish jacksons generalship
in compensation monroe made him the first territorial governor of florida in
he served as the governor for two months returning to the hermitage in ill health
during his convalescence jackson who had been a freemason since at least became the grand master of the grand lodge of tennessee for
around this time he also completed negotiations for tennessee to purchase chickasaw lands
this became known as the jackson purchase
jackson overton and another colleague had speculated in some of the land and used their portion to form the town of memphis
in jackson agreed to run in the presidential election and he was nominated by the tennessee legislature in july
at the time the federalist party had collapsed and there were four major contenders for the democratic republican party nomination william crawford john quincy adams henry clay and john c
jackson was intended to be a stalking horse candidate to prevent tennessees electoral votes from going to crawford who was seen as a washington insider
jackson unexpectedly garnered popular support outside of tennessee and became a serious candidate
he benefited from the expansion of suffrage among white males that followed the conclusion of the war of
he was a popular war hero whose reputation suggested he had the decisiveness and independence to bring reform to washington
he also was promoted as an outsider who stood for all the people blaming banks for the countrys depression
during his presidential candidacy jackson reluctantly ran for one of tennessees us senate seats
jacksons political managers william berkeley lewis and john eaton convinced him that he needed to defeat incumbent john williams who opposed him
the legislature elected jackson in october
he was attentive to his senatorial duties
he was appointed chairman of the committee on military affairs but avoided debate or initiating legislation
he used his time in the senate to form alliances and make peace with old adversaries
eaton continued to campaign for jacksons presidency updating his biography and writing a series of widely circulated pseudonymous letters that portrayed jackson as a champion of republican liberty
democratic republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses
in most of the democratic republicans in congress boycotted the caucus and the power to choose nominees was shifting to state nominating committees and legislatures
jackson was nominated by a pennsylvania convention making him not merely a regional candidate but the leading national contender
when jackson won the pennsylvania nomination calhoun dropped out of the presidential race
afterwards jackson won the nomination in six other states and had a strong second place finish in three others
in the presidential election jackson won a percent plurality of the popular vote
more importantly he won a plurality of electoral votes receiving votes from states in the south west and mid atlantic
he was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base adams dominated new england crawford won virginia and georgia and clay took three western states
because no candidate had a majority of electoral votes the house of representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the twelfth amendment
the amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote winners are eligible to be elected by the house so clay was eliminated from contention
clay who was also speaker of the house and presided over the elections resolution saw a jackson presidency as a disaster for the country
clay threw his support behind adams who won the contingent election on the first ballot
adams appointed clay as his secretary of state leading supporters of jackson to accuse clay and adams of having struck a corrupt bargain
after the congressional session concluded jackson resigned his senate seat and returned to tennessee
after the election jacksons supporters formed a new party to undermine adams and ensure he served only one term
adamss presidency went poorly and adamss behavior undermined it
he was perceived as an intellectual elite who ignored the needs of the populace
he was unable to accomplish anything because congress blocked his proposals
in his first annual message to congress adams stated that we are palsied by the will of our constituents which was interpreted as his being against representative democracy
jackson responded by championing the needs of ordinary citizens and declaring that the voice of the people
must be heard
jackson was nominated for president by the tennessee legislature in october more than three years before the election
he gained powerful supporters in both the south and north including calhoun who became jacksons vice presidential running mate and new york senator martin van buren
meanwhile adamss support from the southern states was eroded when he signed a tax on european imports the tariff of which was called the tariff of abominations by opponents into law
jacksons victory in the presidential race was overwhelming
he won percent of the popular vote and percent of the electoral vote
the election ended the one party system that had formed during the era of good feelings as jacksons supporters coalesced into the democratic party and the various groups who did not support him eventually formed the whig party
the political campaign was dominated by the personal abuse that partisans flung at both candidates
jackson was accused of being the son of an english prostitute and a mulatto and he was labeled a slave trader who trafficked in human flesh
a series of pamphlets known as the coffin handbills accused him of having murdered white men including the soldiers he had executed for desertion and alleging that he stabbed a man in the back with his cane
they stated that he had intentionally massacred native american women and children at the battle of horseshoe bend ate the bodies of native americans he killed in battle and threatened to cut off the ears of congressmen who questioned his behavior during the first seminole war
jackson and rachel were accused of adultery for living together before her divorce was finalized and rachel heard about the accusation
she had been under stress throughout the election and just as jackson was preparing to head to washington for his inauguration she fell ill
she did not live to see her husband become president dying of a stroke or heart attack a few days later
jackson believed that the abuse from adams supporters had hastened her death stating at her funeral may god almighty forgive her murderers as i know she forgave them
i never can
jackson arrived in washington dc on february and began forming his cabinet
he chose van buren as secretary of state john eaton as secretary of war samuel d
ingham as secretary of treasury john branch as secretary of navy john m
berrien as attorney general and william t
barry as postmaster general
jackson was inaugurated on march adams who was embittered by his defeat refused to attend
jackson become the first president elect to take the oath of office on the east portico of the us capitol
in his inaugural address he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states respect the limits of the presidency reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees and observe a fair policy toward native americans
jackson invited the public to the white house which was promptly overrun by well wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings
the spectacle earned him the nickname king mob
jackson believed that adamss administration had been corrupt and he initiated investigations into all executive departments
these investigations revealed that was stolen from the treasury
they also resulted in a reduction in costs to the department of the navy saving million
jackson asked congress to tighten laws on embezzlement and tax evasion and he pushed for an improved government accounting system
jackson implemented a principle he called rotation in office
the previous custom had been for the president to leave the existing appointees in office replacing them through attrition
jackson enforced the tenure of office act an law that limited office tenure authorized the president to remove current office holders and appoint new ones
during his first year in office he removed about of all federal employees and replaced them with loyal democrats
jackson argued that rotation in office reduced corruption by making officeholders responsible to the popular will but it functioned as political patronage and became known as the spoils system
jackson spent much of his time during his first two and a half years in office dealing with what came to be known as the petticoat affair or eaton affair
the affair focused on secretary of war eatons wife margaret
she had a reputation for being promiscuous and like rachel jackson she was accused of adultery
she and eaton had been close before her first husband john timberlake died and they married nine months after his death
with the exception of barrys wife catherine the cabinet members wives followed the lead of vice president calhouns wife floride and refused to socialize with the eatons
though jackson defended margaret her presence split the cabinet which had been so ineffective that he rarely called it into session and the ongoing disagreement led to its dissolution
in the spring of jackson demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except barry who would resign in when a congressional investigation revealed his mismanagement of the post office
jackson tried to compensate van buren by appointing him the minister to great britain but calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie breaking vote against it
van buren along with newspaper editors amos kendall and francis preston blair would become regular participants in jacksons kitchen cabinet an unofficial varying group of advisors that jackson turned to for decision making even after he had formed a new official cabinet
jacksons presidency marked the beginning of a national policy of native american removal
before jackson took office the relationship between the southern states and the native american tribes who lived within their boundaries was strained
the states felt that they had full jurisdiction over their territories the native tribes saw themselves as autonomous nations that had a right to the land they lived on
significant portions of the five major tribes in the area then known as the southwest the cherokee choctaw chickasaw creek and seminoles began to adopt white culture including education agricultural techniques a road system and rudimentary manufacturing
in the case of the tensions between the state of georgia and the cherokee adams had tried to address the issue encouraging cherokee emigration west of the mississippi through financial incentives but most refused
in the first days of jacksons presidency some southern states passed legislation extending state jurisdiction to native american lands
jackson supported the states right to do so
his position was later made clear in the supreme court test case of this legislation worcester v
georgia had arrested a group of missionaries for entering cherokee territory without a permit the cherokee declared these arrests illegal
the court under chief justice john marshall decided in favor of the cherokee imposition of georgia law on the cherokee was unconstitutional
horace greeley alleges that when jackson heard the ruling he said well john marshall has made his decision but now let him enforce it
although the quote may be apocryphal jackson made it clear he would not use the federal government to enforce the ruling
jackson used the power of the federal government to enforce the separation of indigenous tribes and whites
in may jackson signed the indian removal act which congress had narrowly passed
it gave the president the right to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the eastern part of the united states in exchange for lands set aside for native americans west of the mississippi as well as broad discretion on how to use the federal funds allocated to the negotiations
the law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program but it was not implemented as one
jacksons administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes fraud and intimidation and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe
the relocations could be a source of misery too the choctaw relocation was rife with corruption theft and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people
in jackson personally negotiated with the chickasaw who quickly agreed to move
in the same year choctaw leaders signed the treaty of dancing rabbit creek the majority did not want the treaty but complied with its terms
in seminole leaders signed the treaty of paynes landing which stipulated that the seminoles would move west and become part of the muscogee creek confederacy if they found the new land suitable
most seminoles refused to move leading to the second seminole war in that lasted six years
members of the muscogee creek confederacy ceded their land to the state of alabama in the treaty of cusseta of
their private ownership of the land was to be protected but the federal government did not enforce this
the government did encourage voluntary removal until the creek war of after which almost all creek were removed to oklahoma territory
in cherokee leaders ceded their land to the government by the treaty of new echota
their removal known as the trail of tears was enforced by jacksons successor van buren
jackson also applied the removal policy in the northwest
he was not successful in removing the iroquois confederacy in new york but when some members of the meskwaki and the sauk triggered the black hawk war by trying to cross back to the east side of the mississippi the peace treaties ratified after their defeat reduced their lands further
during his administration he made about treaties with american indian tribes
he had removed almost all the native americans east of the mississippi and south of lake michigan about people from the united states though it was done at the cost of thousands of native american lives lost because of the unsanitary conditions and epidemics arising from their dislocation as well as their resistance to expulsion
jacksons implementation of the indian removal act contributed to his popularity with his constituency
he added over square miles of land to the public domain which primarily benefited the united states agricultural interests
the act also benefited small farmers as jackson allowed them to purchase moderate plots at low prices and offered squatters on land formerly belonging to native americans the option to purchase it before it was offered for sale to others
jackson had to confront another challenge that had been building up since the beginning of his first term
the tariff of which had been passed in the last year of adams administration set a protective tariff at a very high rate to prevent the manufacturing industries in the northern states from having to compete with lower priced imports from britain
the tariff reduced the income of southern cotton planters it propped up consumer prices but not the price of cotton which had severely declined in the previous decade
immediately after the tariffs passage the south carolina exposition and protest was sent to the us senate
this document which had been anonymously written by john c
calhoun asserted that the constitution was a compact of individual states and when the federal government went beyond its delegated duties such as enacting a protective tariff a state had a right to declare this action unconstitutional and make the act null and void within the borders of that state
jackson suspected calhoun of writing the exposition and protest and opposed his interpretation
jackson argued that congress had full authority to enact tariffs and that a dissenting state was denying the will of the majority
he also needed the tariff which generated of the federal revenue to achieve another of his presidential goals eliminating the national debt
the issue developed into a personal rivalry between the two men
for example during a celebration of thomas jeffersons birthday on april the attendees gave after dinner toasts
jackson toasted our federal union it must be preserved a clear challenge to nullification
calhoun whose toast immediately followed rebutted the union next to our liberty the most dear as a compromise jackson supported the tariff of which reduced the duties from the tariff of by almost half
the bill was signed on july but failed to satisfy extremists on either side
on november south carolina had passed the ordinance of nullification declaring both tariffs null and void and threatening to secede from the united states if the federal government tried to use force to collect the duties
in response jackson sent warships to charleston harbor and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession
on december he issued a proclamation against the nullifiers condemning nullification as contrary to the constitutions letter and spirit rejecting the right of secession and declaring that south carolina stood on the brink of insurrection and treason
on december calhoun who had been elected to the us senate resigned as vice president
jackson asked congress to pass a force bill authorizing the military to enforce the tariff
it was attacked by calhoun as despotism
meanwhile calhoun and clay began to work on a new compromise tariff
jackson saw it as an effective way to end the confrontation but insisted on the passage of the force bill before he signed
on march he signed into law the force bill and the tariff of
the south carolina convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance but nullified the force bill in a final act of defiance
two months later jackson reflected on south carolinas nullification the tariff was only the pretext and disunion and southern confederacy the real object
the next pretext will be the negro or slavery question
a few weeks after his inauguration jackson started looking into how he could replace the second bank of the united states
the bank had been chartered by president madison in to restore the united states economy after the war of
monroe had appointed nicholas biddle as the banks executive
the bank was a repository for the countrys public monies which also serviced the national debt it was formed as a for profit entity that looked after the concerns of its shareholders
in the country was prosperous and the currency was stable but jackson saw the bank as a fourth branch of government run by an elite what he called the money power that sought to control the labor and earnings of the real people who depend on their own efforts to succeed the planters farmers mechanics and laborers
additionally jacksons own near bankruptcy in due to credit fuelled land speculation had biased him against paper money and toward a policy favorable to hard money
in his first annual address in december jackson openly challenged the bank by questioning its constitutionality and the soundness of its money
jacksons supporters further alleged that it gave preferential loans to speculators and merchants over artisans and farmers that it used its money to bribe congressmen and the press and that it had ties with foreign creditors
biddle responded to jacksons challenge in early by using the banks vast financial holding to ensure the banks reputation and his supporters argued that the bank was the key to prosperity and stable commerce
by the time of the election biddle had spent over in printing pamphlets lobbying for pro bank legislation hiring agents and giving loans to editors and congressmen
on the surface jacksons and biddles positions did not appear irreconcilable
jackson seemed open to keeping the bank if it could include some degree of federal oversight limit its real estate holdings and have its property subject to taxation by the states
many of jacksons cabinet members thought a compromise was possible
in treasury secretary louis mclane told biddle that jackson was open to chartering a modified version of the bank but biddle did not consult jackson directly
privately jackson expressed opposition to the bank publicly he announced that he would leave the decision concerning the bank in the hands of the people
biddle was finally convinced to take open action by henry clay who had decided to run for president against jackson in the election
biddle would agree to seek renewal of the charter two years earlier than scheduled
clay argued that jackson was in a bind
if he vetoed the charter he would lose the votes of his pro bank constituents in pennsylvania but if he signed the charter he would lose his anti bank constituents
after the recharter bill was passed jackson vetoed it on july arguing that the country should not surrender the will of the majority to the desires of the wealthy
the presidential election demonstrated the rapid development of political parties during jacksons presidency
the democratic partys first national convention held in baltimore nominated jacksons choice for vice president martin van buren
the national republican party which had held its first convention in baltimore earlier in december nominated clay now a senator from kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania
an anti masonic party with a platform built around opposition to freemasonry supported neither jackson nor clay who both were masons
the party nominated william wirt of maryland and amos ellmaker of pennsylvania
in addition to the votes jackson would lose because of the bank veto clay hoped that jacksons indian removal act would alienate voters in the east but jacksons losses were offset by the acts popularity in the west and southwest
clay had also expected that jackson would lose votes because of his stand on internal improvements
jackson had vetoed the maysville road bill which funded an upgrade of a section of the national road in clays state of kentucky jackson had argued it was unconstitutional to fund internal improvements using national funds for local projects
clays strategy failed
jackson was able to mobilize the democratic partys strong political networks
the northeast supported jackson because he was in favor of maintaining a stiff tariff the west supported him because the indian removal act reduced the number of native americans in the region and made available more public land
except for south carolina which passed the ordinance of nullification during the election month and refused to support any party by giving its votes to the future governor of virginia john b
floyd the south supported jackson for implementing the indian removal act as well as for his willingness to compromise by signing the tariff of
jackson won the election by a landslide receiving percent of the popular vote and electoral votes
jackson saw his victory as a mandate to continue his war on the banks control over the national economy
in jackson signed an executive order ending the deposit of treasury receipts in the bank
when secretary of the treasury mclane refused to execute the order jackson replaced him with william j
duane who also refused
jackson then appointed roger b
taney as acting secretary who implemented jacksons policy
with the loss of federal deposits the bank had to contract its credit
biddle used this contraction to create an economic downturn in an attempt to get jackson to compromise
biddle wrote nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in congress
the attempt did not succeed the economy recovered and biddle was blamed for the recession
jacksons actions led those who disagreed with him to form the whig party
they claimed to oppose jacksons expansion of executive power calling him king andrew the first and naming their party after the english whigs who opposed the british monarchy in the th century
in march the senate censured jackson for inappropriately taking authority for the treasury department when it was the responsibility of congress and refused to confirm taneys appointment as secretary of the treasury
in april however the house declared that the bank should not be rechartered
by july the bank no longer held any federal deposits
jackson had federal funds deposited into state banks friendly to the administrations policies which critics called pet banks
the number of these state banks more than doubled during jacksons administration and investment patterns changed
the bank which had been the federal governments fiscal agent invested heavily in trade and financed interregional and international trade
state banks were more responsive to state governments and invested heavily in land development land speculation and state public works projects
in spite of the efforts of taneys successor levi woodbury to control them the pet banks expanded their loans helping to create a speculative boom in the final years of jacksons administration
in january jackson paid off the national debt the only time in us history that it had been accomplished
it was paid down through tariff revenues carefully managing federal funding of internal improvements like roads and canals and the sale of public lands
between and the government had an unprecedented spike in land sales at its peak in the profits from land sales were eight to twelve times higher than a typical year
during jacksons presidency million acres of public land about the size of the state of oklahoma was sold
after jacksons term expired in a democrat majority senate expunged jacksons censure
despite the economic boom following jacksons victory in the bank war land speculation in the west caused the panic of
jacksons transfer of federal monies to state banks in caused western banks to relax their lending standards the indian removal act made large amounts of former native american lands available for purchase and speculation
two of jacksons acts in contributed to the panic of
one was the specie circular which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by specie
the act was intended to stabilize the economy by reducing speculation on credit but it caused a drain of gold and silver from the eastern banks to the western banks to address the needs of financing land transactions
the other was the deposit and distribution act which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks
together they left eastern banks unable to pay specie to the british when they recalled their loans to address their economic problems in international trade
the panic drove the us economy into a depression that lasted until
jackson was the first president to be subjected to both a physical assault and an assassination attempt
on may robert b
randolph struck jackson in the face with his hand because jackson had ordered randolphs dismissal from the navy for embezzlement
jackson declined to press charges
while jackson was leaving the united states capitol on january richard lawrence an unemployed house painter from england aimed a pistol at him which misfired
lawrence pulled out a second pistol which also misfired
jackson attacked lawrence with his cane until others intervened to restrain lawrence who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and institutionalized
during jacksons presidency slavery remained a minor political issue
though federal troops were used to crush nat turners slave rebellion in jackson ordered them withdrawn immediately afterwards despite the petition of local citizens for them to remain for protection
jackson considered the issue too divisive to the nation and to the delicate alliances of the democratic party
jacksons view was challenged when the american anti slavery society agitated for abolition by sending anti slavery tracts through the postal system into the south in
jackson condemned these agitators as monsters who should atone with their lives because they were attempting to destroy the union by encouraging sectionalism
the act provoked riots in charleston and pro slavery southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials
to address the issue jackson authorized that the tracts could be sent only to subscribers whose names could be made publicly accountable
that december jackson called on congress to prohibit the circulation through the south of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection
the jackson administration successfully negotiated a trade agreement with siam the first east asian country to form a trade agreement with the us the administration also made trade agreements with great britain spain russia and the ottoman empire
in his first annual message to congress jackson addressed the issues of spoliation claims demands of compensation for the capture of american ships and sailors by foreign nations during the napoleonic wars
using a combination of bluster and tact he successfully settled these claims with denmark portugal and spain but he had difficulty collecting spoliation claims from france which was unwilling to pay an indemnity agreed to in an earlier treaty
jackson asked congress in to authorize reprisals against french property if the country failed to make payment as well as to arm for defense
in response france put its caribbean fleet on a wartime footing
both sides wanted to avoid a conflict but the french wanted an apology for jacksons belligerence
in his annual message to the congress jackson asserted that he refused to apologize but stated that he did not intend to menace or insult the government of france
the french were assuaged and agreed to pay to settle the claims
since the early s large numbers of americans had been immigrating into texas a territory of the newly independent nation of mexico
as early as jackson had supported acquiring the region for the united states
in he attempted to purchase it but mexico did not want to sell
by there were twice as many settlers from the united states as from mexico leading to tensions with the mexican government that started the texas revolution
during the conflict jackson covertly allowed the settlers to obtain weapons and money from the united states
they defeated the mexican military in april and declared the region an independent country the republic of texas
the new republic asked jackson to recognize and annex it
although jackson wanted to do so he was hesitant because he was unsure it could maintain independence from mexico
he also was concerned because texas had legalized slavery which was an issue that could divide the democrats during the election
jackson recognized the republic of texas on the last full day of his presidency march
jackson appointed six justices to the supreme court
most were undistinguished
jackson nominated roger b
taney in january to the court in reward for his services but the nomination failed to win senate approval
when chief justice marshall died in jackson again nominated taney for chief justice he was confirmed by the new senate serving as chief justice until
he was regarded with respect during his career on the bench but he is most remembered for his widely condemned decision in dred scott v
on the last day of his presidency jackson signed the judiciary act of which created two new supreme court seats and reorganized the federal circuit courts
two new states were admitted into the union during jacksons presidency arkansas and michigan
both states increased democratic power in congress and helped van buren win the presidency in as new states tended to support the party that had done the most to admit them
jacksons presidency ended on march
jackson left washington dc three days later retiring to the hermitage in nashville where he remained influential in national and state politics
to reduce the inflation caused by the panic of jackson supported an independent treasury system that would restrict the government from printing paper money and require it to hold its money in silver and gold
during the presidential election jackson campaigned for van buren in tennessee but van buren had become unpopular during the continuing depression
the whig party nominee william henry harrison won the election using a campaign style similar to that of the democrats van buren was depicted as an uncaring aristocrat while harrisons war record was glorified and he was portrayed as a man of the people
harrison won the election and the whigs captured majorities in both houses of congress but harrison died a month into his term and was replaced by his vice president former democrat john tyler
jackson was encouraged because tyler was not bound to party loyalties and praised him when he vetoed two whig sponsored bills to establish a new national bank in
jackson lobbied for the annexation of texas
he was concerned that the british could use it as a base to threaten the united states and insisted that it was part of the louisiana purchase
tyler signed a treaty of annexation in april but it became associated with the expansion of slavery and was not ratified
van buren who had been jacksons preferred candidate for the democratic party in the presidential election had opposed annexation
disappointed by van buren jackson convinced fellow tennessean james k
polk who was then set to be van burens running mate to run as the democratic partys presidential nominee instead
polk defeated van buren for the nomination and won the general election against jacksons old enemy henry clay
meanwhile the senate passed a bill to annex texas and it was signed on march
jackson died of dropsy tuberculosis and heart failure at years of age on june
he was surrounded by family enslaved persons and friends at his deathbed and he was recorded to have said do not cry i hope to meet you all in heaven yes all in heaven white and black
he was buried in the same tomb as his wife rachel
jackson and rachel had no children together but adopted andrew jackson jr the son of rachels deceased brother severn donelson
the jacksons acted as guardians for donelsons other children john samuel daniel smith and andrew jackson
they were also guardians for andrew jackson hutchings rachels orphaned grand nephew and the orphaned children of a friend edward butler caroline eliza edward and anthony who lived with the jacksons after their father died
jackson also had three creek children living with them lyncoya a creek orphan jackson had adopted after the battle of tallushatchee and two boys they called theodore and charley
for the only time in us history two women acted simultaneously as unofficial first lady for the widower jackson
rachels niece emily donelson was married to andrew jackson donelson and served as hostess at the white house
the president and emily became estranged for over a year during the petticoat affair but they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as white house hostess
sarah yorke jackson the wife of andrew jackson jr became co hostess of the white house in and took over all hostess duties after emily died from tuberculosis in
jackson had a reputation for being short tempered and violent which terrified his opponents
he was able to use his temper strategically to accomplish what he wanted
he could keep it in check when necessary his behavior was friendly and urbane when he went to washington as senator during the campaign leading up to the election
according to van buren he remained calm in times of difficulty and made his decisions deliberatively
he had the tendency to take things personally
if someone crossed him he would often become obsessed with crushing them
for example on the last day of his presidency jackson declared he had only two regrets that he had not hanged henry clay or shot john c
he also had a strong sense of loyalty
he considered threats to his friends as threats to himself but he demanded unquestioning loyalty in return
jackson was self confident without projecting a sense of self importance
this self confidence gave him the ability to persevere in the face of adversity
once he decided on a plan of action he would adhere to it
his reputation for being both quick tempered and confident worked to his advantage it misled opponents to see him as simple and direct leading them to often understimate his political shrewdness
in jackson became an official member of the first presbyterian church in nashville
both his mother and his wife had been devout presbyterians all their lives but jackson stated that he had postponed officially entering the church until after his retirement to avoid accusations that he had done so for political reasons
jacksons legacy is controversial and polarizing
his contemporary alexis de tocqueville depicted him as the spokesperson of the majority and their passions
he has been variously described as a frontiersman personifying the independence of the american west a slave owning member of the southern gentry and a populist who promoted faith in the wisdom of the ordinary citizen
he has been represented as a statesman who substantially advanced the spirit of democracy and upheld the foundations of american constitutionalism as well as an autocratic demagogue who crushed political opposition and trampled the law
in the s jacksons rise to power became associated with the idea of the common man
this idea defined the age as a populist rejection of social elites and a vindication of every persons value independent of class and status
jackson was seen as its personification an individual free of societal constraints who can achieve great things
in arthur m
schlesinger jrs influential age of jackson redefined jacksons legacy through the lens of franklin d
roosevelts new deal describing the common man as a member of the working class struggling against exploitation by business concerns
in the twenty first century jacksons indian removal act has been described as ethnic cleansing the use of force terror and violence to make an area ethnically homogeneous
to achieve the goal of separating native americans from the whites coercive force such as threats and bribes were used to effect removal and unauthorized military force was used when there was resistance as in the case of the second seminole war
the act has been discussed in the context of genocide and its role in the long term destruction of native american societies and their cultures continues to be debated
jacksons legacy has been variously used by later presidents
abraham lincoln referenced jacksons ideas when negotiating the challenges to the union that he faced during including jacksons understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the presidents right to interpret the constitution
franklin d
roosevelt used jackson to redefine the democratic party describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights
the members of the progressive party of to saw themselves as the heirs to jackson
donald trump used jacksons legacy to present himself as the president of the common man praising jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting american workers with a tariff
in president barack obamas administration announced it was removing jacksons portrait from the bill and replacing it with one of harriet tubman
though the plan was put on hold during trumps presidency president joe bidens administration resumed it in
jackson is usually rated highly as a president but his reputation began to decline in the s
his contradictory legacy is shown in opinion polls
a survey of political scientists rated jackson as the ninth highest rated president but the third most polarizing
he was also ranked the third most overrated president
in a c span poll of historians jackson was ranked the th in th in and nd in
andrew johnson was an american politician who served as the th president of the united states from to
he assumed the presidency following the assassination of abraham lincoln as he was vice president at that time
johnson was a democrat who ran with abraham lincoln on the national union party ticket coming to office as the civil war concluded
he favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the union without protection for the newly freed people who were formerly enslaved
this led to conflict with the republican dominated congress culminating in his impeachment by the house of representatives in
he was acquitted in the senate by one vote
johnson was born into poverty and never attended school
he was apprenticed as a tailor and worked in several frontier towns before settling in greeneville tennessee serving as an alderman and mayor before being elected to the tennessee house of representatives in
after briefly serving in the tennessee senate johnson was elected to the house of representatives in where he served five two year terms
he became governor of tennessee for four years and was elected by the legislature to the senate in
during his congressional service he sought passage of the homestead bill which was enacted soon after he left his senate seat in
southern slave states seceded to form the confederate states of america including tennessee but johnson remained firmly with the union
he was the only sitting senator from a confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his states secession
in lincoln appointed him as military governor of tennessee after most of it had been retaken
in johnson was a logical choice as running mate for lincoln who wished to send a message of national unity in his re election campaign and became vice president after a victorious election in
johnson implemented his own form of presidential reconstruction a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform their civil governments
southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed black codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties but congressional republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the southern actions
johnson vetoed their bills and congressional republicans overrode him setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency
johnson opposed the fourteenth amendment which gave citizenship to former slaves
in he went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies seeking to break republican opposition
as the conflict grew between the branches of government congress passed the tenure of office act restricting johnsons ability to fire cabinet officials
he persisted in trying to dismiss secretary of war edwin stanton but ended up being impeached by the house of representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the senate
he did not win the democratic presidential nomination and left office the following year
johnson returned to tennessee after his presidency and gained some vindication when he was elected to the senate in making him the only president to afterwards serve in the senate
he died five months into his term
johnsons strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for black americans is widely criticized
historians have consistently ranked him one of the worst presidents in american history
andrew johnson was born in raleigh north carolina on december to jacob johnson and mary mcdonough a laundress
he was of english scots irish and scottish ancestry
he had a brother william four years his senior and an older sister elizabeth who died in childhood
johnsons birth in a two room shack was a political asset in the mid th century and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins
jacob johnson was a poor man as had been his father william johnson but he became town constable of raleigh before marrying and starting a family
jacob johnson had been a porter for the state bank of north carolina appointed by william polk a relative of president james k
both jacob and mary were illiterate and had worked as tavern servants while johnson never attended school and grew up in poverty
jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell shortly after rescuing three drowning men when his son andrew was three
polly johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family
her occupation was then looked down on as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied
since andrew did not resemble either of his siblings there are rumors that he may have been fathered by another man
polly johnson eventually remarried to a man named turner doughtry who was as poor as she was
johnsons mother apprenticed her son william to a tailor james selby
andrew also became an apprentice in selbys shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his st birthday
johnson lived with his mother for part of his service and one of selbys employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills
his education was augmented by citizens who would come to selbys shop to read to the tailors as they worked
even before he became an apprentice johnson came to listen
the readings caused a lifelong love of learning and one of his biographers annette gordon reed suggests that johnson later a gifted public speaker learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth
johnson was not happy at james selbys and after about five years both he and his brother ran away
selby responded by placing a reward for their return ten dollars reward
ran away from the subscriber two apprentice boys legally bound named william and andrew johnson
to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in raleigh or i will give the above reward for andrew johnson alone
the brothers went to carthage north carolina where andrew johnson worked as a tailor for several months
fearing he would be arrested and returned to raleigh johnson moved to laurens south carolina
he found work quickly met his first love mary wood and made her a quilt as a gift
however she rejected his marriage proposal
he returned to raleigh hoping to buy out his apprenticeship but could not come to terms with selby
unable to stay in raleigh where he risked being apprehended for abandoning selby he decided to move west
johnson left north carolina for tennessee traveling mostly on foot
after a brief period in knoxville he moved to mooresville alabama
he then worked as a tailor in columbia tennessee but was called back to raleigh by his mother and stepfather who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west
johnson and his party traveled through the blue ridge mountains to greeneville tennessee
andrew johnson fell in love with the town at first sight and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration
in greeneville johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home
in at the age of he married year old eliza mccardle the daughter of a local shoemaker
the pair were married by justice of the peace mordecai lincoln first cousin of thomas lincoln whose son would become president
the johnsons were married for almost years and had five children martha charles mary robert and andrew jr
though she had tuberculosis eliza supported her husbands endeavors
she taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing
shy and retiring by nature eliza johnson usually remained in greeneville during johnsons political rise
she was not often seen during her husbands presidency their daughter martha usually served as official hostess
johnsons tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate
he later boasted of his talents as a tailor my work never ripped or gave way
he was a voracious reader
books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views
he also took part in debates at greeneville college
in johnson purchased his first slave dolly who was years old at the time
dolly had three children liz florence and william
soon after his purchase of dolly he purchased dollys half brother sam
sam johnson and his wife margaret had nine children
sam became a commissioner of the freedmens bureau and was known for being a proud man who negotiated the nature of his work with the johnson family
notably he received some monetary compensation for his labors and negotiated with andrew johnson to receive a tract of land which andrew johnson gave him for free in
in andrew johnson purchased henry who was at the time and would later accompany the johnson family to the white house
ultimately johnson owned at least ten slaves
andrew johnson freed his slaves on august they remained with him as paid servants
a year later johnson as military governor of tennessee proclaimed the freedom of tennessees slaves
sam and margaret johnsons former slaves lived in his tailor shop while he was president without rent
as a sign of appreciation for proclaiming freedom andrew johnson was given a watch by newly emancipated people in tennessee inscribed with for his untiring energy in the cause of freedom
johnson helped organize a mechanics ticket in the greeneville municipal election
he was elected town alderman along with his friends blackston mcdannel and mordecai lincoln
following nat turners rebellion in a state convention was called to pass a new constitution including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color
the convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates and provide ways of funding improvements to tennessees infrastructure
the constitution was submitted for a public vote and johnson spoke widely for its adoption the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure
on january his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of greeneville
in johnson made a bid for election to the floater seat which greene county shared with neighboring washington county in the tennessee house of representatives
according to his biographer hans l
trefousse johnson demolished the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin
during his greeneville days johnson joined the tennessee militia as a member of the th regiment
he attained the rank of colonel though while an enrolled member johnson was fined for an unknown offense
afterwards he was often addressed or referred to by his rank
in his first term in the legislature which met in the state capital of nashville johnson did not consistently vote with either the democratic or the newly formed whig party though he revered president andrew jackson a democrat and fellow tennessean
the major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals with the party system in a state of flux
the whig party had organized in opposition to jackson fearing the concentration of power in the executive branch of the government johnson differed from the whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation
after brookins campbell and the whigs defeated johnson for reelection in johnson would not lose another race for thirty years
in he sought to regain his seat initially as a whig but when another candidate sought the whig nomination he ran as a democrat and was elected
from that time he supported the democratic party and built a powerful political machine in greene county
johnson became a strong advocate of the democratic party noted for his oratory and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it people flocked to hear him
in johnson was selected as a presidential elector for tennessee giving him more statewide publicity
although democratic president martin van buren was defeated by former ohio senator william henry harrison johnson was instrumental in keeping greene county in the democratic column
he was elected to the tennessee senate in where he served a two year term
he had achieved financial success in his tailoring business but sold it to concentrate on politics
he had also acquired additional real estate including a larger home and a farm and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves
having served in both houses of the state legislature johnson saw election to congress as the next step in his political career
he engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain democratic support including the displacement of the whig postmaster in greeneville and defeated jonesborough lawyer john a
aiken by votes to
in washington he joined a new democratic majority in the house of representatives
johnson advocated for the interests of the poor maintained an anti abolitionist stance argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs
with eliza remaining in greeneville congressman johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the library of congress
although a fellow tennessee democrat james k
polk was elected president in and johnson had campaigned for him the two men had difficult relations and president polk refused some of his patronage suggestions
johnson believed as did many southern democrats that the constitution protected private property including slaves and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery
he won a second term in against william g
brownlow presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy
in his second term johnson supported the polk administrations decision to fight the mexican war seen by some northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward and opposed the wilmot proviso a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from mexico
he introduced for the first time his homestead bill to grant to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it
this issue was especially important to johnson because of his own humble beginnings
in the presidential election of the democrats split over the slavery issue and abolitionists formed the free soil party with former president van buren as their nominee
johnson supported the democratic candidate former michigan senator lewis cass
with the party split whig nominee general zachary taylor was easily victorious and carried tennessee
johnsons relations with polk remained poor the president recorded of his final new years reception in that johnson due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district also supported government assistance for the east tennessee and virginia railroad
during his campaign for a fourth term johnson concentrated on three issues slavery homesteads and judicial elections
he defeated his opponent nathaniel g
taylor in august with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns
when the house convened in december the party division caused by the free soil party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a speaker
johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a speaker by a plurality some weeks later others took up a similar proposal and democrat howell cobb was elected
once the speaker election had concluded and congress was ready to conduct legislative business the issue of slavery took center stage
northerners sought to admit california a free state to the union
kentuckys henry clay introduced in the senate a series of resolutions the compromise of to admit california and pass legislation sought by each side
johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of the slave trade in the nations capital
he pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators and of the president and limiting the tenure of federal judges to years
these were all defeated
a group of democrats nominated landon carter haynes to oppose johnson as he sought a fifth term the whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own
the campaign included fierce debates johnsons main issue was the passage of the homestead bill haynes contended it would facilitate abolition
johnson won the election by more than votes
though he was not enamored of the partys presidential nominee in former new hampshire senator franklin pierce johnson campaigned for him
pierce was elected but he failed to carry tennessee
in johnson managed to get the house to pass his homestead bill but it failed in the senate
the whigs had gained control of the tennessee legislature and under the leadership of gustavus henry redrew the boundaries of johnsons first district to make it a safe seat for their party
the nashville union termed this henry mandering lamented johnson i have no political future
if johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek reelection he soon changed his mind
his political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor
the democratic convention unanimously named him though some party members were not happy at his selection
the whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections and still controlled the legislature
that party nominated henry making the henry mandering of the first district an immediate issue
the two men debated in county seats the length of tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the august election due to illness in henrys family
johnson won the election by votes to some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support whig nathaniel taylor for his old seat in congress
tennessees governor had little power johnson could propose legislation but not veto it and most appointments were made by the whig controlled legislature
nevertheless the office was a bully pulpit that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views
he succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of john bell a whig for one of the states us senate seats
in his first biennial speech johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system abolition of the bank of tennessee and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures the last was passed
johnson was critical of the tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes either statewide or county by county a mixture of the two was passed
reforms carried out during johnsons time as governor included the foundation of the states public library and its first public school system and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers
although the whig party was on its final decline nationally it remained strong in tennessee and the outlook for democrats there in was poor
feeling that reelection as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought johnson agreed to make the run
meredith p
gentry received the whig nomination
a series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued
the issues in the campaign were slavery the prohibition of alcohol and the nativist positions of the know nothing party
johnson favored the first but opposed the others
gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question and had gained the support of the know nothings a group johnson portrayed as a secret society
johnson was unexpectedly victorious albeit with a narrower margin than in
when the presidential election of approached johnson hoped to be nominated some tennessee county conventions designated him a favorite son
his position that the best interests of the union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president
he was never a major contender the nomination fell to former pennsylvania senator james buchanan
though he was not impressed by either johnson campaigned for buchanan and his running mate john c
breckinridge who were elected
johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor with an eye towards election to the us senate
in while returning from washington his train derailed causing serious damage to his right arm
this injury would trouble him in the years to come
the victors in the state legislative campaign would once they convened in october elect a united states senator
former whig governor william b
campbell wrote to his uncle the great anxiety of the whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat andrew johnson for senator
should the democrats have the majority he will certainly be their choice and there is no man living to whom the americans and whigs have as much antipathy as johnson
the governor spoke widely in the campaign and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature
johnsons final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors and he made proposals popular among democrats
two days later the legislature elected him to the senate
the opposition was appalled with the richmond whig newspaper referring to him as the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the union
johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self employed tradesmen who made up much of tennessees electorate
he called them the plebeians he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state democratic party but none could match him as a vote getter
after his death one tennessee voter wrote of him johnson was always the same to everyone
the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen
always seen in impeccably tailored clothing he cut an impressive figure and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate
mostly denied the partys machinery he relied on a network of friends advisers and contacts
one friend hugh douglas stated in a letter to him you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time
at heart many of us never wanted you to be governor only none of the rest of us could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you
then we did not want you to go to the senate but the people would send you
the new senator took his seat when congress convened in december
he came to washington as usual without his wife and family eliza would visit washington only once during johnsons first time as senator in
johnson immediately set about introducing the homestead bill in the senate but as most senators who supported it were northern the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue
southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the homestead bill were more likely to be northern non slaveholders
the issue of slavery had been complicated by the supreme courts ruling earlier in the year in dred scott v
sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories
johnson a slaveholding senator from a southern state made a major speech in the senate the following may in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the homestead bill and slavery were not incompatible
nevertheless southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation
in it failed on a procedural vote when vice president breckinridge broke a tie against the bill and in a watered down version passed both houses only to be vetoed by buchanan at the urging of southerners
johnson continued his opposition to spending chairing a committee to control it
he argued against funding to build infrastructure in washington dc stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the citys streets even if it was the seat of government
he opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the mormons in utah territory arguing for temporary volunteers as the united states should not have a standing army
in october abolitionist john brown and sympathizers raided the federal arsenal at harpers ferry virginia
tensions in washington between pro and anti slavery forces increased greatly
johnson gave a major speech in the senate in december decrying northerners who would endanger the union by seeking to outlaw slavery
the tennessee senator stated that all men are created equal from the declaration of independence did not apply to african americans since the constitution of illinois contained that phrase and that document barred voting by african americans
johnson by this time was a wealthy man who owned slaves
johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the democratic party tore itself apart over the slavery question
busy with the homestead bill during the democratic national convention in charleston south carolina he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal making
the convention deadlocked with no candidate able to gain the required two thirds vote but the sides were too far apart to consider johnson as a compromise
the party split with northerners backing illinois senator stephen douglas while southerners including johnson supported vice president breckinridge for president
with former tennessee senator john bell running a fourth party candidacy and further dividing the vote the republican party elected its first president former illinois representative abraham lincoln
the election of lincoln known to be against the spread of slavery was unacceptable to many in the south
although secession from the union had not been an issue in the campaign talk of it began in the southern states
johnson took to the senate floor after the election giving a speech well received in the north i will not give up this government
no i intend to stand by it
and i invite every man who is a patriot to
rally around the altar of our common country
and swear by our god and all that is sacred and holy that the constitution shall be saved and the union preserved
as southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded he reminded mississippi senator jefferson davis that if southerners would only hold to their seats the democrats would control the senate and could defend the souths interests against any infringement by lincoln
gordon reed points out that while johnsons belief in an indissoluble union was sincere he had alienated southern leaders including davis who would soon be the president of the confederate states of america formed by the seceding states
if the tennessean had backed the confederacy he would have had small influence in its government
johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession
his successor as governor isham g
harris and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession when that failed they put the question of leaving the union to a popular vote
despite threats on johnsons life and actual assaults he campaigned against both questions sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him
although johnsons eastern region of tennessee was largely against secession the second referendum passed and in june tennessee joined the confederacy
believing he would be killed if he stayed johnson fled through the cumberland gap where his party was in fact shot at
he left his wife and family in greeneville
as the only member from a seceded state to remain in the senate and the most prominent southern unionist johnson had lincolns ear in the early months of the war
with most of tennessee in confederate hands johnson spent congressional recesses in kentucky and ohio trying in vain to convince any union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into east tennessee
johnsons first tenure in the senate came to a conclusion in march when lincoln appointed him military governor of tennessee
much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered
although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the confederates were defeated in an area lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over union controlled southern regions
the senate quickly confirmed johnsons nomination along with the rank of brigadier general
in response the confederates confiscated his land and his slaves and turned his home into a military hospital
later in after his departure from the senate and in the absence of most southern legislators the homestead bill was finally enacted
along with legislation for land grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad the homestead bill has been credited with opening the western united states to settlement
as military governor johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state
he demanded loyalty oaths from public officials and shut down all newspapers owned by confederate sympathizers
much of eastern tennessee remained in confederate hands and the ebb and flow of war during sometimes brought confederate control again close to nashville
however the confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him
johnson undertook the defense of nashville as well as he could though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by general nathan bedford forrest
relief from union regulars did not come until general william s
rosecrans defeated the confederates at murfreesboro in early
much of eastern tennessee was captured later that year
when lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation in january declaring freedom for all slaves in confederate held areas he exempted tennessee at johnsons request
the proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war as not all unionists supported abolition
johnson finally decided that slavery had to end
he wrote if the institution of slavery
seeks to overthrow it government then the government has a clear right to destroy it
he reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the union army feeling that african americans should perform menial tasks to release white americans to do the fighting
nevertheless he succeeded in recruiting black soldiers to serve the union
in lincolns running mate had been senator hannibal hamlin of maine
although hamlin had served competently was in good health and was willing to run again johnson emerged as running mate for lincolns reelection bid in
lincoln considered several war democrats for the ticket in and sent an agent to sound out general benjamin butler as a possible running mate
in may the president dispatched general daniel sickles to nashville on a fact finding mission
although sickles denied that he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor johnson biographer hans l
trefousse believes that sickless trip was connected to johnsons subsequent nomination for vice president
according to historian albert castel in his account of johnsons presidency lincoln was impressed by johnsons administration of tennessee
gordon reed points out that while the lincoln hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in having johnson the southern war democrat on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country
another factor was the desire of secretary of state william seward to frustrate the vice presidential candidacy of fellow new yorker and former senator daniel s
dickinson a war democrat as seward would probably have had to yield his place if another new yorker became vice president
johnson once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of sickles visit was active on his own behalf delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy
to sound a theme of unity in lincoln ran under the banner of the national union party rather than that of the republicans
at the partys convention in baltimore in june lincoln was easily nominated although there had been some talk of replacing him with a cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals
after the convention backed lincoln former secretary of war simon cameron offered a resolution to nominate hamlin but it was defeated
johnson was nominated for vice president by cm allen of indiana with an iowa delegate seconding it
on the first ballot johnson led with votes to for hamlin and for dickinson
on the second ballot kentucky switched its vote for johnson beginning a stampede
johnson was named on the second ballot with votes to hamlins and eight for dickinson the nomination was made unanimous
lincoln expressed pleasure at the result andy johnson i think is a good man
when word reached nashville a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the union
although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign johnson gave a number of speeches in tennessee kentucky ohio and indiana
he also sought to boost his chances in tennessee while reestablishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive in that voters would now have to swear that they opposed making a settlement with the confederacy
the democratic candidate for president george mcclellan hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters
lincoln declined to override johnson and their ticket took the state by votes
congress refused to count tennessees electoral votes but lincoln and johnson did not need them having won in most states that had voted and easily secured the election
now vice president elect johnson was eager to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in tennessee although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after inauguration day march
he hoped to remain in nashville to complete his task but was told by lincolns advisers that he could not stay but would be sworn in with lincoln
in these months union troops finished the retaking of eastern tennessee including greeneville
just before his departure the voters of tennessee ratified a new constitution which abolished slavery on february
one of johnsons final acts as military governor was to certify the results
johnson traveled to washington to be sworn into office although according to gordon reed in light of what happened on march it might have been better if johnson had stayed in nashville
johnson may have been ill castel cited typhoid fever though gordon reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis
on the evening of march johnson attended a party in his honor at which he drank heavily
hung over the following morning at the capitol he asked vice president hamlin for some whiskey
hamlin produced a bottle and johnson took two stiff drinks stating i need all the strength for the occasion i can have
in the senate chamber johnson delivered a rambling address as lincoln the congress and dignitaries looked on
almost incoherent at times he finally meandered to a halt whereupon hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president
lincoln who had watched sadly during the debacle then went to his own swearing in outside the capitol and delivered his acclaimed second inaugural address
in the weeks after the inauguration johnson only presided over the senate briefly and hid from public ridicule at the maryland home of a friend francis preston blair
when he did return to washington it was with the intent of leaving for tennessee to reestablish his family in greeneville
instead he remained after word came that general ulysses s
grant had captured the confederate capital of richmond virginia presaging the end of the war
lincoln stated in response to criticism of johnsons behavior that i have known andy johnson for many years he made a bad slip the other day but you need not be scared andy aint a drunkard
on the afternoon of april lincoln and johnson met for the first time since the inauguration
trefousse states that johnson wanted to induce lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors gordon reed agrees
that night president lincoln was shot and mortally wounded at fords theatre by john wilkes booth a confederate sympathizer
the shooting of the president was part of a conspiracy to assassinate lincoln johnson and seward the same night
seward barely survived his wounds while johnson escaped attack as his would be assassin george atzerodt got drunk instead of killing the vice president
leonard j
farwell a fellow boarder at the kirkwood house awoke johnson with news of lincolns shooting
johnson rushed to the presidents deathbed where he remained a short time on his return promising they shall suffer for this
they shall suffer for this
lincoln died at am the next morning johnsons swearing in occurred between and am with chief justice salmon p
chase presiding in the presence of most of the cabinet
johnsons demeanor was described by the newspapers as solemn and dignified
some cabinet members had last seen johnson apparently drunk at the inauguration
at noon johnson conducted his first cabinet meeting in the treasury secretarys office and asked all members to remain in their positions
the events of the assassination resulted in speculation then and subsequently concerning johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him
in the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of johnson was merely a ruse
conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination booth came to the kirkwood house and left one of his cards with johnsons private secretary william a
the message on it was dont wish to disturb you
are you at home j
wilkes booth
johnson presided with dignity over lincolns funeral ceremonies in washington before his predecessors body was sent home to springfield illinois for interment
shortly after lincolns death union general william t
sherman reported he had without consulting washington reached an armistice agreement with confederate general joseph e
johnston for the surrender of confederate forces in north carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power with private property rights to be respected
this did not even grant freedom to those in slavery
this was not acceptable to johnson or the cabinet who sent word for sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals which he did
further johnson placed a bounty on confederate president davis then a fugitive which gave johnson the reputation of a man who would be tough on the south
more controversially he permitted the execution of mary surratt for her part in lincolns assassination
surratt was executed with three others including atzerodt on july
upon taking office johnson faced the question of what to do with the former confederacy
president lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in virginia arkansas louisiana and tennessee as the union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the union
congress considered this too lenient its own plan requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath passed both houses in but lincoln pocket vetoed it
johnson had three goals in reconstruction
he sought a speedy restoration of the states on the grounds that they had never truly left the union and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government
to johnson african american suffrage was a delay and a distraction it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote
second political power in the southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved plebeians
johnson feared that the freedmen many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters might vote at their direction
johnsons third priority was election in his own right in a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish attempting to secure a democratic anti congressional reconstruction coalition in the south
the republicans had formed a number of factions
the radical republicans sought voting and other civil rights for african americans
they believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote republican in gratitude for emancipation and that black votes could keep the republicans in power and southern democrats including former rebels out of influence
they believed that top confederates should be punished
the moderate republicans sought to keep the democrats out of power at a national level and prevent former rebels from resuming power
they were not as enthusiastic about the idea of african american suffrage as their radical colleagues either because of their own local political concerns or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly
northern democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the southern states
they did not support african american suffrage which might threaten democratic control in the south
johnson was initially left to devise a reconstruction policy without legislative intervention as congress was not due to meet again until december
radical republicans told the president that the southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the union
but johnson with the support of other officials including seward insisted that the franchise was a state not a federal matter
the cabinet was divided on the issue
johnsons first reconstruction actions were two proclamations with the unanimous backing of his cabinet on may
one recognized the virginia government led by provisional governor francis pierpont
the second provided amnesty for all ex rebels except those holding property valued at or more it also appointed a temporary governor for north carolina and authorized elections
neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmens rights
the president ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states
as southern states began the process of forming governments johnsons policies received considerable public support in the north which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the south
while he received such support from the white south he underestimated the determination of northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing
it was important in northern public opinion that the south acknowledge its defeat that slavery be ended and that the lot of african americans be improved
voting rights were less important at the time only a handful of northern states gave african american men the right to vote on the same basis as whites and in late connecticut wisconsin and minnesota voted down african american suffrage proposals by large margins
northern public opinion tolerated johnsons inaction on black suffrage as an experiment to be allowed if it quickened southern acceptance of defeat
instead white southerners felt emboldened
a number of southern states passed black codes binding african american laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor
most southerners elected to congress were former confederates with the most prominent being georgia senator designate and former confederate vice president alexander stephens
congress assembled in early december johnsons conciliatory annual message to them was well received
nevertheless congress refused to seat the southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate reconstruction legislation
northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant confederate leaders such as stephens rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw
they saw the black codes placing african americans in a position barely above slavery
republicans also feared that restoration of the southern states would return the democrats to power
in addition according to david o
stewart in his book on johnsons impeachment the violence and poverty that oppressed the south would galvanize the opposition to johnson
congress was reluctant to confront the president and initially only sought to fine tune johnsons policies towards the south
according to trefousse if there was a time when johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the republican party it was the period following the return of congress
the president was unhappy about the provocative actions of the southern states and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there but made no statement publicly believing that southerners had a right to act as they did even if it was unwise to do so
by late january he was convinced that winning a showdown with the radical republicans was necessary to his political plans both for the success of reconstruction and for reelection in
he would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise african americans in the district of columbia a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all white referendum
a bill to accomplish this passed the house of representatives but to johnsons disappointment stalled in the senate before he could veto it
illinois senator lyman trumbull leader of the moderate republicans and chairman of the judiciary committee was anxious to reach an understanding with the president
he ushered through congress a bill extending the freedmens bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in and the first civil rights bill to grant citizenship to the freedmen
trumbull met several times with johnson and was convinced the president would sign the measures
in fact the president opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty
additionally both of trumbulls bills were unpopular among white southerners whom johnson hoped to include in his new party
johnson vetoed the freedmans bureau bill on february to the delight of white southerners and the puzzled anger of republican legislators
he considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the senate the following day
johnson believed that the radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate republicans would form behind him he did not understand that moderates also wanted to see african americans treated fairly
on february washingtons birthday johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the white house and called for an address in honor of the first president
in his hour long speech he instead referred to himself over times
more damagingly he also spoke of men
still opposed to the union to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the south
when called upon by the crowd to say who they were johnson named pennsylvania congressman thaddeus stevens massachusetts senator charles sumner and abolitionist wendell phillips and accused them of plotting his assassination
republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war while one democratic ally estimated johnsons speech cost the party votes in the congressional midterm elections
although strongly urged by moderates to sign the civil rights act of johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on march
in his veto message he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when out of states were unrepresented in the congress and that it discriminated in favor of african americans and against whites
within three weeks congress had overridden his veto the first time that had been done on a major bill in american history
the veto often seen as a key mistake of johnsons presidency convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him
historian eric foner in his volume on reconstruction views it as the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career
according to stewart the veto was for many his defining blunder setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency
congress also proposed the fourteenth amendment to the states
written by trumbull and others it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part though johnson opposed it
the amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the civil rights act into the constitution but also went further
the amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the united states penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen and most importantly created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts
it also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of confederate war debts
further it disqualified many former confederates from office although the disability could be removed by congress not the president
both houses passed the freedmens bureau act a second time and again the president vetoed it this time the veto was overridden
by the summer of when congress finally adjourned johnsons method of restoring states to the union by executive fiat without safeguards for the freedmen was in deep trouble
his home state of tennessee ratified the fourteenth amendment despite the presidents opposition
when tennessee did so congress immediately seated its proposed delegation embarrassing johnson
efforts to compromise failed and a political war ensued between the united republicans on one side and on the other johnson and his northern and southern allies in the democratic party
he called a convention of the national union party
republicans had returned to using their previous identifier johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term in
the battleground was the election of southern states were not allowed to vote
johnson campaigned vigorously undertaking a public speaking tour known as the swing around the circle
the trip including speeches in chicago st
louis indianapolis and columbus proved politically disastrous with the president making controversial comparisons between himself and jesus and engaging in arguments with hecklers
these exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency
the republicans won by a landslide increasing their two thirds majority in congress and made plans to control reconstruction
johnson blamed the democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the national union movement
even with the republican victory in november johnson considered himself in a strong position
the fourteenth amendment had been ratified by none of the southern or border states except tennessee and had been rejected in kentucky delaware and maryland
as the amendment required ratification by three quarters of the states to become part of the constitution he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor leading to his election in
once it reconvened in december an energized congress began passing legislation often over a presidential veto this included the district of columbia voting bill
congress admitted nebraska to the union over a veto and the republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment
johnsons veto of a bill for statehood for colorado territory was sustained enough senators agreed that a district with a population of was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day
in january congressman stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts under martial law
the states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions
african americans could vote for or become delegates former confederates could not
in the legislative process congress added to the bill that restoration to the union would follow the states ratification of the fourteenth amendment and completion of the process of adding it to the constitution
johnson and the southerners attempted a compromise whereby the south would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former confederates and for limited black suffrage
the republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment and the deal fell through
although johnson could have pocket vetoed the first reconstruction act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the thirty ninth congress he chose to veto it directly on march congress overruled him the same day
also on march congress passed the tenure of office act over the presidents veto in response to statements during the swing around the circle that he planned to fire cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him
this bill requiring senate approval for the firing of cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards was immediately controversial with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to johnson whose key cabinet officers were lincoln holdovers
secretary of war edwin stanton was an able and hard working man but difficult to deal with
johnson both admired and was exasperated by his war secretary who in combination with general of the army grant worked to undermine the presidents southern policy from within his own administration
johnson considered firing stanton but respected him for his wartime service as secretary
stanton for his part feared allowing johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign despite his public disagreements with his president
the new congress met for a few weeks in march then adjourned leaving the house committee on the judiciary behind tasked in the first impeachment inquiry against johnson with reporting back to the full house whether there were grounds for johnson to be impeached
this committee duly met examined the presidents bank accounts and summoned members of the cabinet to testify
when a federal court released former confederate president davis on bail on may the committee investigated whether the president had impeded the prosecution
it learned that johnson was eager to have davis tried
a bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges the committee adjourned on june
later in june johnson and stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the south could override the civil authorities
the president had attorney general henry stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not
johnson sought to pin down stanton either as for and thus endorsing johnsons position or against showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the cabinet
stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications
when congress reconvened in july it passed a reconstruction act against johnsons position waited for his veto overrode it and went home
in addition to clarifying the powers of the generals the legislation also deprived the president of control over the army in the south
with congress in recess until november johnson decided to fire stanton and relieve one of the military commanders general philip sheridan who had dismissed the governor of texas and installed a replacement with little popular support
johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from grant but on august the president demanded stantons resignation the secretary refused to quit with congress out of session
johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of congress as permitted under the tenure of office act grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the army
grant under protest followed johnsons order transferring sheridan and another of the district commanders daniel sickles who had angered johnson by firmly following congresss plan
the president also issued a proclamation pardoning most confederates exempting those who held office under the confederacy or who had served in federal office before the war but had breached their oaths
although republicans expressed anger with his actions the elections generally went democratic
no seats in congress were directly elected in the polling but the democrats took control of the ohio general assembly allowing them to defeat for reelection one of johnsons strongest opponents senator benjamin wade
voters in ohio connecticut and minnesota turned down propositions to grant african americans the vote
the adverse results momentarily put a stop to republican calls to impeach johnson who was elated by the elections
nevertheless once congress met in november the judiciary committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against johnson
after much debate about whether anything the president had done was a high crime or misdemeanor the standard under the constitution the resolution was defeated by the house of representatives on december by a vote of in favor to opposed
johnson notified congress of stantons suspension and grants interim appointment
in january the senate disapproved of his action and reinstated stanton contending the president had violated the tenure of office act
grant stepped aside over johnsons objection causing a complete break between them
johnson then dismissed stanton and appointed lorenzo thomas to replace him
stanton refused to leave his office and on february the house impeached the president for intentionally violating the tenure of office act by a vote of to
the house subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment for the most part alleging that he had violated the tenure of office act and had questioned the legitimacy of congress
on march the impeachment trial began in the senate and lasted almost three months congressmen george s
boutwell benjamin butler and thaddeus stevens acted as managers for the house or prosecutors and william m
evarts benjamin r
curtis and former attorney general stanbery were johnsons counsel chief justice chase served as presiding judge
the defense relied on the provision of the tenure of office act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration
since lincoln had appointed stanton the defense maintained johnson had not violated the act and also argued that the president had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of congress
johnsons counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial nor publicly comment about the proceedings and except for a pair of interviews in april he complied
johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal for example he pledged to iowa senator james w
grimes that he would not interfere with congresss reconstruction efforts
grimes reported to a group of moderates many of whom voted for acquittal that he believed the president would keep his word
johnson also promised to install the respected john schofield as war secretary
kansas senator edmund g
ross received assurances that the new radical influenced constitutions ratified in south carolina and arkansas would be transmitted to the congress without delay an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal
one reason senators were reluctant to remove the president was that his successor would have been ohio senator wade the president pro tempore of the senate
wade a lame duck who left office in early was a radical who supported such measures as womens suffrage placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation
additionally a president wade was seen as an obstacle to grants ambitions
with the dealmaking johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict and in the days leading up to the ballot newspapers reported that stevens and his radicals had given up
on may the senate voted on the th article of impeachment accusing johnson of firing stanton in violation of the tenure of office of act once the senate had overturned his suspension
thirty five senators voted guilty and not guilty thus falling short by a single vote of the two thirds majority required for conviction under the constitution
ten republicans senators grimes ross trumbull james dixon james rood doolittle daniel sheldon norton william pitt fessenden joseph s
fowler john b
henderson and peter g
van winkle voted to acquit the president
with stevens bitterly disappointed at the result the senate then adjourned for the republican national convention grant was nominated for president
the senate returned on may and voted on the second and third articles with identical results
faced with those results johnsons opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings
stanton relinquished his office on may and the senate subsequently confirmed schofield
when johnson renominated stanbery to return to his position as attorney general after his service as a defense manager the senate refused to confirm him
allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial
even when it was in progress representative butler began an investigation held contentious hearings and issued a report unendorsed by any other congressman
butler focused on a new york based astor house group supposedly led by political boss and editor thurlow weed
this organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through cincinnati lawyer charles woolley to bribe senators to acquit johnson
butler went so far as to imprison woolley in the capitol building when he refused to answer questions but failed to prove bribery
soon after taking office as president johnson reached an accord with secretary of state william h
seward that there would be no change in foreign policy
in practice this meant that seward would continue to run things as he had under lincoln
seward and lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in the victor hoped that seward would succeed him as president in
at the time of johnsons accession the french had intervened in mexico sending troops there
while many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the mexican matter seward preferred quiet diplomacy warning the french through diplomatic channels that their presence in mexico was unacceptable
although the president preferred a more aggressive approach seward persuaded him to follow his lead
in april the french government informed seward that its troops would be brought home in stages to conclude by november
on august johnson and his cabinet gave a reception for queen emma of hawaii who was returning to hawaii after her trip to britain and europe
seward was an expansionist and sought opportunities to gain territory for the united states
after the loss of the crimean war in the s the russian government saw its north american colony as a financial liability and feared losing control to britain whose troops would easily swoop in and annex the territory from neighboring canada in any future conflict
negotiations between russia and the us over the sale of alaska were halted due to the outbreak of the civil war but after the us victory in the war talks resumed
russia instructed its minister in washington baron eduard de stoeckl to negotiate a sale
de stoeckl did so deftly getting seward to raise his offer from million to million and then getting added by raising various objections
this sum of million is equivalent to in present day terms
on march de stoeckl and seward signed the treaty working quickly as the senate was about to adjourn
johnson and seward took the signed document to the presidents room in the capitol only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment
the president summoned the senate into session to meet on april that body approved the treaty
emboldened by his success in alaska seward sought acquisitions elsewhere
his only success was staking an american claim to uninhabited wake island in the pacific which would be officially claimed by the us in
he came close with the danish west indies as denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite but the senate never voted on the treaty and it expired
another treaty that fared badly was the johnson clarendon convention negotiated in settlement of the alabama claims for damages to american shipping from british built confederate raiders
negotiated by the united states minister to britain former maryland senator reverdy johnson in late it was ignored by the senate during the remainder of the presidents term
the treaty was rejected after he left office and the grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from britain
johnson appointed nine article iii federal judges during his presidency all to united states district courts he did not appoint a justice to serve on the supreme court
in april he nominated henry stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of john catron but congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office
johnson appointed his greeneville crony samuel milligan to the united states court of claims where he served from until his death in
in june johnson signed the southern homestead act into law believing that the legislation would assist poor whites
around land claims were successfully patented although few former slaves benefitted from the law fraud was rampant and much of the best land was off limits reserved for grants to veterans or railroads
in june johnson signed an eight hour law passed by congress that established an eight hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the federal government
although johnson told members of a workingmens party delegation in baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight hour day he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all
according to richard f
selcer however the good intentions behind the law were immediately frustrated as wages were cut by
johnson sought nomination by the democratic national convention in new york in july
he remained very popular among southern whites and boosted that popularity by issuing just before the convention a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any confederate not already indicted meaning that only davis and a few others still might face trial
on the first ballot johnson was second to former ohio representative george h
pendleton who had been his democratic opponent for vice president in
johnsons support was mostly from the south and fell away as the ballots passed
on the nd ballot former new york governor horatio seymour was nominated and the president received only four votes all from tennessee
the conflict with congress continued
johnson sent congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six year term and make the president and the senate directly elected and for term limits for judges
congress took no action on them
when the president was slow to officially report ratifications of the fourteenth amendment by the new southern legislatures congress passed a bill again over his veto requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt
he still delayed as much as he could but was required in july to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the constitution
seymours operatives sought johnsons support but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign
it was not until october with the vote already having taken place in some states that he mentioned seymour at all and he never endorsed him
nevertheless johnson regretted grants victory in part because of their animus from the stanton affair
in his annual message to congress in december johnson urged the repeal of the tenure of office act and told legislators that had they admitted their southern colleagues in all would have been well
he celebrated his th birthday in late december with a party for several hundred children though not including those of president elect grant who did not allow his to go
on christmas day johnson issued a final amnesty this one covering everyone including davis
he also issued in his final months in office pardons for crimes including one for dr samuel mudd controversially convicted of involvement in the lincoln assassination and imprisoned in on floridas dry tortugas
on march the president hosted a large public reception at the white house on his final full day in office
grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as johnson as was customary and johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all
despite an effort by seward to prompt a change of mind he spent the morning of march finishing last minute business and then shortly after noon rode from the white house to the home of a friend
after leaving the presidency johnson remained for some weeks in washington then returned to greeneville for the first time in eight years
he was honored with large public celebrations along the way especially in tennessee where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners
he had arranged to purchase a large farm near greeneville to live on after his presidency
some expected johnson to run for governor of tennessee or for the senate again while others thought that he would become a railroad executive
johnson found greeneville boring and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son robert in
seeking vindication for himself and revenge against his political enemies he launched a senate bid soon after returning home
tennessee had gone republican but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and suppression of the african american vote by the ku klux klan led to a democratic victory in the legislative elections in august
johnson was seen as a likely victor in the senate election although hated by radical republicans and by some democrats because of his wartime activities
although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislatures balloting the republicans eventually elected henry cooper over johnson
in there was a special election for an johnson initially sought the democratic nomination but when he saw that it would go to former confederate general benjamin f
cheatham decided to run as an independent
the former president was defeated finishing third but the split in the democratic party defeated cheatham in favor of an old johnson unionist ally horace maynard
in johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered that year he lost about when the first national bank of washington went under though he was eventually repaid much of the sum
he began looking towards the next senate election to take place in the legislature in early
johnson began to woo the farmers grange movement with his jeffersonian leanings he easily gained their support
he spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour
few african americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as reconstruction faded in tennessee setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other southern states the white domination would last almost a century
in the tennessee legislative elections in august the democrats elected legislators to the republicans eight and johnson went to nashville for the legislative session
when the balloting for the senate seat began on january he led with votes but did not have the required majority as three former confederate generals one former colonel and a former democratic congressman split the vote with him
johnsons opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him but failed and he was elected on january on the th ballot with a margin of a single vote
nashville erupted in rejoicing remarked johnson thank god for the vindication
johnsons comeback garnered national attention with the st
louis republican calling it the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of american politics can show
at his swearing in in the senate on march he was greeted with flowers and sworn in alongside hamlin by incumbent vice president henry wilson
many republicans ignored senator johnson though some such as ohios john sherman shook his hand
johnson remains the only former president to serve in the senate
he spoke only once in the short session on march lambasting president grant for his use of federal troops in support of louisianas reconstruction government
the former president asked how far off is military despotism and concluded his speech may god bless this people and god save the constitution
johnson returned home after the special session concluded
in late july convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the ohio gubernatorial race he decided to travel there to give speeches
he began the trip on july and broke the journey at his daughter marys farm near elizabethton where his daughter martha was also staying
that evening he had a stroke but refused medical treatment until the next day when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from elizabethton
he seemed to respond to their ministrations but had another stroke on the evening of july and died early the following morning at the age of
president grant had the painful duty of announcing the death of the only surviving past president
northern newspapers in their obituaries tended to focus on johnsons loyalty during the war while southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president
johnsons funeral was held on august in greeneville
he was buried with his body wrapped in an american flag and a copy of the us constitution placed under his head according to his wishes
the burial ground was dedicated as the andrew johnson national cemetery in and with his home and tailors shop is part of the andrew johnson national historic site
according to castel historians johnsons presidency have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event through the remainder of the th century there were few historical evaluations of johnson and his presidency
memoirs from northerners who had dealt with him such as former vice president henry wilson and maine senator james g
blaine depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the south in reconstruction but was frustrated by congress
according to historian howard k
beale in his journal article about the historiography of reconstruction men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth
thus dates for the mermnad kings are uncertain and are based on a computation by j
bury and russell meiggs who estimated c c bc for the reign of gyges
herodotus gave reign lengths for gyges successors but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between and
bury and meiggs concluded that ardys and sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the th century bc but they did not propose dates for alyattes except their assertion that his son croesus succeeded him in bc
the timespan bc for the reign of croesus is almost certainly accurate
however based on an analysis of sources contemporary with gyges such as neo assyrian records anthony spalinger has convincingly deduced dated gygess death to bce and alexander dale has consequently dated alyattess reign as starting in c
bce and ending in bce
alyattes was the son of the king sadyattes of lydia and his sister and queen lyde of lydia both the children of the king ardys of lydia
alyattes ascended to the kingship of lydia during period of severe crisis during the th century bce the cimmerians a nomadic people from the eurasian steppe who had invaded western asia attacked lydia several times but had been repelled by alyattess great grandfather gyges
in bce the cimmerians led by their king lygdamis attacked lydia for the third time
the lydians were defeated sardis was sacked and gyges was killed following which he was succeeded by his son ardys
in bce during the seventh regnal year of ardys the thracian treres tribe who had migrated across the thracian bosporus and invaded anatolia under their king kobos and in alliance with the cimmerians and the lycians attacked lydia
they defeated the lydians again and for a second time sacked the lydian capital of sardis except for its citadel
it is probable that ardys was killed during this cimmerian attack or was deposed in bc for being unable to protect lydia from the cimmerian attacks and ardyss son and successor sadyattes might have also been either killed during another cimmerian attack in bce or deposed that year for his inability to successfully protect lydia from the cimmerian incursions
alyattes thus succeeded his father sadyattes amidst extreme turmoil in bce
alyattes started his reign by continuing the hostilities with the ionian city of miletus started by sadyattes
alyattess war with miletus consisted largely of a series of raids to capture the milesians harvest of grain which were severely lacking in the lydian core regions
these hostilities lasted until alyattess sixth year when he finally made peace with the citys tyrant thrasybulus and a treaty of friendship as well as one of military alliance was concluded between lydia and miletus whereby since miletus lacked auriferous and other metallurgic resources while cereals were scarce in lydia trade of lydian metal in exchange of milesian cereal was initiated to seal these treaties according to which miletus voluntarily provided lydia with military auxiliaries and would profit from the lydian control of the routes in inner anatolia and lydia would gain access to the markets and maritime networks of the milesians in the black sea and at naucratis
herodotuss account of alyattess illness caused by lydian troops destruction of the temple athena in assesos and which was cured after he heeded the pythia and rebuilt two temples of athena in assesos and then made peace with miletus is a largely legendary account of these events which appears to not be factual
this legendary account likely arose as a result of alyattess offerings to the sanctuary of delphi
unlike with the other greek cities of anatolia alyattes always maintained very good relations with ephesus to whose ruling dynasty the mermnads were connected by marriage alyattess great grandfather had married one of his daughters to the ephesian tyrant melas the elder alyattess grandfather ardys had married his daughter lyde to a grandson of melas the elder named miletus and alyattes himself married one of his own daughters to the then tyrant of miletus a descendant of miletus named melas the younger and from this union would be born pindar of ephesus
one of the daughters of melas the younger might have in turn married alyattes and become the mother of his less famous son pantaleon
thanks to these close ties ephesus had never been subject to lydian attacks and was exempt from paying tribute and offering military support to lydia and both the greeks of ephesus and the anatolian peoples of the region that is the lydians and carians shared in common the temple of an anatolian goddess equated by the greeks to their own goddess artemis
lydia and ephesus also shared important economic interests which allowed ephesus to hold an advantageous position between the maritime trade routes of the aegean sea and the continental trade routes going through inner anatolia and reaching assyria thus acting as an intermediary between the lydian kingdom which controlled access to the trade routes leading to the inside of asia and the greeks inhabiting the european continent and the aegean islands and allowing ephesus to profit from the goods transiting across its territory without fear of any military attack by the lydians
these connections in turn provided lydia with a port through which it could have access to the mediterranean sea
like his great grandfather gyges alyattes also dedicated lavish offerings to the oracle of the god apollo at delphi
according to the greek historian herodotus alyattess offerings consisted of a large silver crater and an iron crater stand which had been made by welding by glaucus of chios thus combining lydian and ionian artistic traditions
alyattess offering to delphi might have been sent to please the sanctuary of apollo and the delphains especially the priests to impress the greek visitors of the sanctuary and to influence the oracle to advise to periander of corinth an ally of thrasybulus of miletus to convince the latter to make peace with alyattes
according to tractatus de mulieribus lyde was the wife and sister of alyattes the ancestor of croesus
lydes son alyattes when he inherited the kingdom from his father committed the terrible crime of tearing the clothes of respectable people and spitting on many
she too held her son back as much as she could and placated those who were insulted with kind words and actions
she showed all his compassion to her son and made him feel great love for himself
when she believes that he is loved enough and abstains from food and other things citing his illness as an excuse xenophilos accompanies his mother that he does not eat in the same way and has changed enough to be extremely honest and fair alyattes after seeing this becomes a changed man
in the south alyattes continued what had been the lydian policy since gygess reign of maintaining alliances with the city states of the carians with whom the lydians also had strong cultural connections such as sharing the sanctuary of the god zeus of mylasa with the carians and the mysians because they believed these three peoples descended from three brothers
these alliances between the lydian kings and the various carian dynasts required the lydian and carian rulers had to support each other and to solidify these alliances alyattes married a woman from the carian aristocracy with whom he had a son croesus who would eventually succeed him
these connections established between the lydian kings and the carian city states ensured that the lydians were able to control caria through alliances with carian dynasts ruling over fortified settlements such as mylasa and pedasa and through lydian aristocrats settled in carian cities such as in aphrodisias
alyattes had inherited more than one war from his father and soon after his ascension and early during his reign with assyrian approval and in alliance with the lydians the scythians under their king madyes entered anatolia expelled the treres from asia minor and defeated the cimmerians so that they no longer constituted a threat again following which the scythians extended their domination to central anatolia until they were themselves expelled by the medes from western asia in the s bce
this final defeat of the cimmerians was carried out by the joint forces of madyes whom strabo credits with expelling the treres and cimmerians from asia minor and of alyattes whom herodotus of halicarnassus and polyaenus claim finally defeated the cimmerians
in polyaenus account of the defeat of the cimmerians he claimed that alyattes used war dogs to expel them from asia minor with the term war dogs being a greek folkloric reinterpretation of young scythian warriors who following the indo european passage rite of the would ritually take on the role of wolf or dog warriors
immediately after this first victory of his over the cimmerians alyattes expelled from the lydian borderlands a final remaining pocket of cimmerian presence who had been occupying the nearby city of antandrus for one century and to facilitate this he re founded the city of adramyttium in aeolis
alyattes installed his son croesus as the governor of adramyttium and he soon expelled these last remaining cimmerians from asia minor
adramyttium was moreso an important site for lydia because it was situated near atarneus and astyra where rich mines were located
alyattes turned towards phrygia in the east
the kings of lydia and of the former phrygian kingdom had already entertained friendly relations before the destruction of the latter by the cimmerians
after defeating the cimmerians alyattes took advantage of the weakening of the various polities all across anatolia by the cimmerian raids and used the lack of a centralised phrygian state and the traditionally friendly relations between the lydian and phrygian elites to extend lydian rule eastwards to phrygia
lydian presence in phrygia is archaeologically attested by the existence of a lydian citadel in the phrygian capital of gordion as well as lydian architectural remains in northwest phrygia such as in dascylium and in the phrygian highlands at midas city
lydian troops might have been stationed in the aforementioned locations as well as in hacturul afyonkarahisar and konya which would have provided to the lydian kingdom access to the produce and roads of phrygia
the presence of a lydian ivory plaque at kerkenes da suggests that alyattess control of phrygia might have extended to the east of the halys river to include the city of pteria with the possibility that he may have rebuilt this city and placed a phrygian ruler there pterias strategic location would have been useful in protecting the lydian empire from attacks from the east and its proximity to the royal road would have made of the city an important centre from which caravans could be protected
phrygia under lydian rule would continue to be administered by its local elites such as the ruler of midas city who held phrygian royal titles such as and but were under the authority of the lydian kings of sardis and had a lydian diplomatic presence at their court following the framework of the traditional vassalage treaties used since the period of the hittite and assyrian empires and according to which the lydian king imposed on the vassal rulers a treaty of vassalage which allowed the local phrygian rulers to remain in power in exchange of which the phrygian vassals had the duty to provide military support and sometimes offer rich tribute to the lydian kingdom
the status of gordion and dascylium is however less clear and it is uncertain whether they were also ruled by local phrygian kings vassal to the lydian king or whether they were directly ruled by lydian governors
with the defeat of the cimmerians having created a power vacuum in anatolia alyattes continued his expansionist policy in the east and of all the peoples to the west of the halys river whom herodotus claimed alyattess successor croesus ruled over the lydians phrygians mysians mariandyni chalybes paphlagonians thyni and bithyni thracians carians ionians dorians aeolians and pamphylians it is very likely that a number of these populations had already been conquered under alyattes especially since information is attested only about the relations between the lydians and the phrygians in both literary and archaeological sources and there is no available data concerning relations between the other mentioned peoples and the lydian kings
the only populations herodotus claimed were independent of the lydian empire were the lycians who lived in a mountainous country which would not have been accessible to the lydian armies and the cilicians who had already been conquered by neo babylonian empire
modern estimates nevertheless suggest that it is not impossible that the lydians might have subjected lycia given that the lycian coast would have been important for the lydians because it was close to a trade route connecting the aegean region the levant and cyprus
at some point in the later years of his reign alyattes conducted a military campaign in caria although the reason for this intervention is yet unknown
alyattess son croesus as governor of adramyttium had to provide his father with ionian greek mercenaries for this war
in bce alyattes resumed his military activities in the west and the second ionian city he attacked was smyrna despite the lydian kings having previously established good relations with the smyrniotes in the aftermath of a failed attack of gyges on the city leading to the lydians using the port of smyrna to export their products and import grain lydian craftsmen being allowed to settle in smyrniot workshops and alyattes having provided funding to the inhabitants of the city for the construction of their temple of athena
alyattes was thus able to acquire a port which gave the lydian kingdom permanent access to the sea and a stable source of grain to feed the population of his kingdom through this attack
smyrna was placed under the direct rule of a member of the mermnad dynasty and alyattes had new fortification walls built for smyrna from around to around bce
although under direct lydian rule smyrnas temple of athena and its houses were rebuilt and the city was not forced to provide the lydian kingdom with military troops or tribute smyrna itself was in ruins and it would only be around bce under the reign of alyattess son croesus that smyrna would finally start to recover
alyattes also initially initiated friendly relations with the ionian city of colophon which included a military alliance according to which the city had to offer the service of its famous and feared cavalry which was itself made up of the aristocracy of colophon to the lydian kingdom should alyattes request their help
following the capture of smyrna alyattes attacked the ionian city of clazomenae but the inhabitants of the city managed to successfully repel him with the help of the colophonian cavalry
following alyattess defeat the lydian kingdom and the city of clazomenae concluded a reconciliation agreement which allowed lydian craftsmen to operate in clazomenae and allowed the kingdom of lydia itself to participate in maritime trade most especially in the olive oil trade produced by the craftsmen of clazomenae but also to use the citys port to export products manufactured in lydia proper
soon after capturing smyrna and his failure to capture clazomenae alyattes summoned the colophonian cavalry to sardis where he had them massacred in violation of hospitality laws and redistributed their horses to lydian cavalrymen following which he placed colophon itself under direct lydian rule
the reason for alyattess breaking of the friendly relations with colophon are unknown although the archaeologist john manuel cook has suggested that alyattes might have concluded a treaty of friendship and a military alliance with colophon to secure the citys non interference in his military operations against the other greek cities on the western coast of asia minor but colophon first violated these agreements with alyattes by supporting clazomenae with its cavalry against alyattess attack prompting the lydian king to retaliate by massacring the mounted aristocracy of colophon
the status of the other ionian greek cities on the western coast of asia minor that is teos lebedus teichiussa melie erythrae phocaea and myus is still uncertain for the period of alyattess reign although they would all eventually be subjected by his son croesus
alyattess eastern conquests extended the lydian empire till the upper euphrates according to the scholar igor diakonoff who identified alyattes with the biblical gog
this expansionism brought the lydian empire in conflict in the s bce with the medes an iranian people who had expelled the majority of the scythians from western asia after participating in the destruction of the neo assyrian empire
after the majority of the scythians were expelled by the medes during that decade out of western asia and into the pontic steppe a war broke out between the median empire and another group of scythians probably members of a splinter group who had formed a kingdom in what is now azerbaijan
these scythians left median ruled transcaucasia and fled to sardis because the lydians had been allied to the scythians
after alyattes refused to accede to the demands of the median king cyaxares that these scythian refugees be handed to him a war broke out between the median and lydian kingdoms in bce which was waged in eastern anatolia beyond pteria
this war lasted five years until a solar eclipse occurred in bce during a battle opposing the lydian and median armies which both sides interpreted as an omen to end the war
the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar ii and the king syennesis of cilicia acted as mediators in the ensuing peace treaty which was sealed by the marriage of cyaxaress son astyages with alyattess daughter aryenis and the possible wedding of a daughter of cyaxares with either alyattes or with his son croesus
the border between the lydian and median empires was fixed at a yet undetermined location in eastern anatolia the graeco roman historians traditional account of the halys river as having been set as the border between the two kingdoms appears to have been a retroactive narrative construction based on symbolic role assigned by greeks to the halys as the separation between lower asia and upper asia as well as on the halys being a later provincial border within the achaemenid empire
alyattes died shortly after the battle of the eclipse in bce itself following which lydia faced a power struggle between his son pantaleon born from a greek woman and his other son croesus born from a carian noblewoman out of which the latter emerged successful
the tomb of alyattes is located in sardis at the site now called bin tepe in a large tumulus measuring sixty metres in height and of a diameter of two hundred and fifty metres
the tomb consisted of an antechamber and a chamber with a door separating them was built of well fitted and clamped large marble blocks its walls were finely finished on the inside and it contained a now lost crepidoma
