anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is skeptical of all justifications for authority and seeks to abolish the institutions it claims maintain unnecessary coercion and hierarchy typically including governments nation states and capitalism
anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations
as a historically leftwing movement this reading of anarchism is placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement
humans have lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states realms or empires
with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies scepticism toward authority also rose
although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment
during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation
various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period
anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the paris commune the russian civil war and the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism
in the last decades of the th and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more growing in popularity and influence within anticapitalist antiwar and antiglobalisation movements
anarchists employ diverse approaches which may be generally divided into revolutionary and evolutionary strategies there is significant overlap between the two
evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like but revolutionary tactics which have historically taken a violent turn aim to overthrow authority and the state
many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory critique and praxis
the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix an and the word arkhos
the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy
anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder
various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists
many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierrejoseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the midth century
since the s and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states
some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic freemarket philosophy only and freemarket anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism
while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party and extreme cultural liberals who are primarily concerned with civil liberties
additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism
anarchism is broadly used to describe the antiauthoritarian wing of the socialist movement
anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are stateoriented or from above
scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two
some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism and being both liberal and socialist but more so
many scholars reject anarchocapitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles
while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently
major definitional elements include the will for a noncoercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a noncoercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy
before the creation of towns and cities established authority did not exist
it was after the institution of authority that anarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction
the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece
in china philosophical anarchism was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi
alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism
anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece
aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy
socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience
cynics dismissed human law and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature
stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state
in medieval europe there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements
these and other muslim movements later gave birth to religious anarchism
in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i
in basra religious sects preached against the state
in europe various sects developed antistate and libertarian tendencies
renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of antiauthoritarian secularism particularly in france
enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority and the revolutions of the s and all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism
during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enrags and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of antistate and federalist sentiments
the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierrejoseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france
by the late s various anarchist schools of thought had become welldefined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from to
this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism
drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents
the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council
bakunins faction and proudhons followers opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress
anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in
bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers
in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st
imier international
under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarchocommunism overlapped with collectivism
anarchocommunists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs
by the turn of the th century anarchism had spread all over the world
it was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement
in china small groups of students imported the humanistic proscience version of anarchocommunism
tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from east asian countries who moved to the japanese capital to study
in latin america argentina was a stronghold for anarchosyndicalism where it became the most prominent leftwing ideology
during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence known as propaganda of the deed
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts
even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the us including the immigration act of also called the anarchist exclusion act
illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period
despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement especially in the makhnovshchina however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government had stabilised including during the kronstadt rebellion
several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine before the bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too
with the anarchists being repressed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism
the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party
seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements
in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international
in the spanish civil war of anarchists and syndicalists once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists
a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war and particularly in the spanish revolution of
in response to the army rebellion an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land
the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the may days as joseph stalin asserted soviet control of the republican government ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists
by the end of world war ii the anarchist movement had been severely weakened
the s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxismleninism and tensions built by the cold war
during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the antinuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the s and the new left
it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anticapitalist reformism
anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols
the established feminist tendencies of anarchafeminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism
black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic
this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america
around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anticapitalist antiwar and antiglobalisation movements
anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization the group of eight and the world economic forum
during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police
other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet
a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the seattle wto conference
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria
while having revolutionary aspirations many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays
instead they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation
scholar carissa honeywell takes the example of food not bombs group of collectives to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work direct action working together and in solidarity with those left behind
while doing so they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger ranging from defunding the arms industry to addressing monsanto seedsaving policies and patents helping farmers and commodification of food and housing
honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans but nonhumans and the environment as well
honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity but are causal factors as well resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole
anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution
the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership
in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the postclassical currents developed thereafter
beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy
anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy
anarchisms emphasis on anticapitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarchocapitalism and other types of economic libertarianism
anarchism is usually placed on the farleft of the political spectrum
much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian antistatist libertarian and radical interpretations of leftwing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories
as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely
one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mrmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time
belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists
despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authority and decentralisation
inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism
they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism
they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society
mutualism is an thcentury economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierrejoseph proudhon
its aims include abolishing the state reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people
mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism
in what is property proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin
collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism
collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
anarchocommunism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production held by a federal network of voluntary associations with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need
anarchocommunism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international
it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late th century
anarchosyndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically selfmanaged by workers
the basic principles of anarchosyndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers selfmanagement
individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants
early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau
through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation
anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left
interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the antiglobalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation
as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest
anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches
the anticapitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents
contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence
its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory
various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement
while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently
gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarchafeminists than anarchocommunists
anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government economic class systems autocratic religions patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism
anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed
the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions
this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy
anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends
a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other
evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two
anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century
anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches
during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency
not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed
assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful
anarchists also took part in revolutions
many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state
many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late s the early s and the s with some still occurring in the early s
their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions
anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial
anarchopacifists advocate for nonviolence means to achieve their stateless nonviolent ends
other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism
this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible
emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil
anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist
they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism
anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism
those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media
in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards
both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies
members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included
overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors
they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico
militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking antifascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening
anarchists commonly employ direct action
this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of selfmanaging their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and nonhierarchical collectives
decisionmaking is often handled in an antiauthoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism
contemporaryera anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations
in contrast with the biga anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term smalla anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classicalera anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierrejoseph proudhon to justify their opinions
those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize
the decisionmaking process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role
anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group
one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point
minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values
anarchists usually form small groups to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members
these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks
anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate
as in the past newspapers and journals are used and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message
anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals
anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free
the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance
anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces
during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal
as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action
acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds
adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity
as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common
its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory
the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism
anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened selfinterest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines
phenomena such as civilisation technology and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others
objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism
anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies
instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite
authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people
another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption
anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society
specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary
robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate
bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be
john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely
beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ
as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy many anarchists address analyse and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles
sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing
sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men
a historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love
in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory relationship anarchy and queer anarchism
free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men
the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure
those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together
free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love
anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage and prochoice and had a similar agenda
anarchist and nonanarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another
during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well
by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents
with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a poststructuralist critique of sexual normality
some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation
the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism
anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid
anarchist writers such as william godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges
in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church
ferrers approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance
ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students
the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested
nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world
christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free
in a similar token a
neill founded what became the summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion
anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation
ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism
late th century and contemporary anarchist writers intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society
contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality
while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modernday major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions
judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider americancanadian network of schools the selfmanaged learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain
the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others
in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neoromanticism movement
in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk
anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the nonartist what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life
other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends
in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris rob claims that anarchistinflected practices have increasingly structured movementbased video activism
throughout the th century many prominent anarchists and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts
three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists
it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests
as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect
the thcentury neoimpressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism
in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community
the most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot selfgovern and so a state is necessary for human survival
philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that eace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government
another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be selfgoverning a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism
another criticism of anarchism is that it is inherently unstable an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state
thomas hobbes and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the peoples interests and keep order
philosopher robert nozick argued that a nightwatchman state or minarchy would emerge out of anarchy through the process of an invisible hand in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies evolving into a minimal state
anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a state of nature would not just be in a state of war
anarchoprimitivists in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization such as hierarchies monopolies and inequality outweigh the benefits
philosophy lecturer andrew g
fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world such as at protests but in the world of ethics as well
secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically
this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it
the third argument is that anarchism is selfcontradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory
anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken
lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong
philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of proanarchist books such as a
john simmons moral principles and political obligations
law professor william a
edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious
edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate
in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion
one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority
joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success
raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction
anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment
anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively
classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering
friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticised anarchisms antiauthoritarianism as inherently counterrevolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian
academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas
the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values
according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence
marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act
in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining
albedo is the fraction of sunlight that is diffusely reflected by a body
it is measured on a scale from to
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee received by a surface
the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface
these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time
while bihemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
the temporal resolution may range from seconds to daily monthly or annual averages
unless given for a specific wavelength albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface
this spectrum includes visible light which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright
icealbedo feedback is a positive feedback climate process where a change in the area of ice caps glaciers and sea ice alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet
ice is very reflective therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water
icealbedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change
albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management
the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss
as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directionalhemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance
these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo
earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about
if earth were frozen entirely the average temperature of the planet would drop below
if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about
in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a socalled ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost
in scientists reported that earth dimmed by over two decades as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques
this may have both been cocaused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming
however the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend
this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
human activities change the albedo of various areas around the globe
as per campra et al
human impacts to the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the earths radiative energy balance even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites
the tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in almera spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs
a study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface area temperature of the highalbedo area although changes were localized
a followup study found that coeq
emissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land transformation and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change
it has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo which contributes to global warming
deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate urban heat island
ouyang et al
estimated that on a global scale an albedo increase of in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing gt of co emissions
intentionally enhancing the albedo of the earths surface along with its daytime thermal emittance has been proposed as a solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling
efforts toward widespread implementation of pdrcs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to high values so long as a thermal emittance of at least can be achieved
albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location
that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude
albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation
tropical and subtropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation
because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth
this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker and reflects less heat back into space
this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect
albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather
the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks increased by selfreinforcing or positive feedbacks and reduced by balancing or negative feedbacks
the main reinforcing feedbacks are the watervapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net effect of clouds
when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a snowtemperature feedback results
a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling
in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snowtemperature feedback
however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight cause melting
when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating
snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow
over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than if a marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack
just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snowcovered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water
sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow
when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snowcovered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases
the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts
as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback
both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming
cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates
because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snowcovered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions
albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon based compared to traditional spectralintegrated albedo predictions
research showed impacts of over for vertically mounted systems but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts
spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains of over have been observed for csi cells installed above healthy vegetation
an analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial commercial flat rooftops and residential pitchedroof applications
forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis
for this reason the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation
in other words the climate change mitigation effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight
in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration
the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds
scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
midtohighlatitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground thus contributing to warming
modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary mitigation benefit
in seasonally snowcovered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to
variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy
the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative effect of albedo change and effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes were neutral or perhaps warming
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvs
incidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator
however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction
because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
note that white caps on waves look white because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities
fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies
aerosols have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance
the direct effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect is less certain
as per spracklen et al
the effects are in extremely polluted cities like delhi aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day
another albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is w m with a range to w m
black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo
in astronomy the term albedo can be defined in several different ways depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved
the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of
another notable highalbedo body is eris with an albedo of
many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds
the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and nonlambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect
although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies
two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the geometric albedo and the bond albedo
their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion
in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the singlescattering albedo
it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
it depends on properties of the material the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
formula where formula is the astronomical albedo formula is the diameter in kilometers and formula is the absolute magnitude
in planetary radar astronomy a microwave pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target and the echo from the target is measured
in most instances the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse and the opposite sense
the echo power is measured in terms of radar crosssection formula formula or formula and is equal to the crosssectional area of a metallic sphere at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power
those components of the received echo that return from firstsurface reflections are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection
if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering
formula where the denominator is the effective crosssectional area of the target object with mean radius formula
a smooth metallic sphere would have formula
the values reported for the moon mercury mars venus and comet p jq are derived from the total radar albedo reported in those references
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria
a or a is the first letter and the first vowel of the latin alphabet used in the modern english alphabet the alphabets of other western european languages and others worldwide
its name in english is a plural aes
it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives
the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
the lowercase version can be written in two forms the doublestorey a and singlestorey
the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type
in english grammar a and its variant an are indefinite articles
the earliest known certain ancestor of a is aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants
in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in protosinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stopthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letterso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eighth century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged
