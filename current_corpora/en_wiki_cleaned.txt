anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is skeptical of all justifications for authority and seeks to abolish the institutions it claims maintain unnecessary coercion and hierarchy typically including governments nation states and capitalism
anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with stateless societies and voluntary free associations
as a historically left wing movement this reading of anarchism is placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement
humans have lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states realms or empires
with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies scepticism toward authority also rose
although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment
during the latter half of the th and the first decades of the th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation
various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period
anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the paris commune the russian civil war and the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism
in the last decades of the th and into the st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more growing in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements
anarchists employ diverse approaches which may be generally divided into revolutionary and evolutionary strategies there is significant overlap between the two
evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like but revolutionary tactics which have historically taken a violent turn aim to overthrow authority and the state
many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory critique and praxis
the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix an and the word arkhos
the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy
anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder
various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists
many revolutionaries of the th century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid th century
since the s and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states
some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free market philosophy only and free market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism
while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently been diluted by wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party and extreme cultural liberals who are primarily concerned with civil liberties
additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism
anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti authoritarian wing of the socialist movement
anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state oriented or from above
scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two
some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism and being both liberal and socialist but more so
many scholars reject anarcho capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles
while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently
major definitional elements include the will for a non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non coercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy
before the creation of towns and cities established authority did not exist
it was after the institution of authority that anarchistic ideas were espoused as a reaction
the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece
in china philosophical anarchism was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi
alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism
anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece
aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between laws imposed by the state and personal autonomy
socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience
cynics dismissed human law and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature
stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state
in medieval europe there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements
these and other muslim movements later gave birth to religious anarchism
in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i
in basra religious sects preached against the state
in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies
renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of anti authoritarian secularism particularly in france
enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority and the revolutions of the s and all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism
during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enrags and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments
the first anarchist currents developed throughout the th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france
by the late s various anarchist schools of thought had become well defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from to
this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism
drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents
the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council
bakunins faction and proudhons followers opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress
anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in
bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers
in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st
imier international
under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism
anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs
by the turn of the th century anarchism had spread all over the world
it was a notable feature of the international syndicalist movement
in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism
tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from east asian countries who moved to the japanese capital to study
in latin america argentina was a stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology
during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence known as propaganda of the deed
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts
even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to prevent anarchists immigrating to the us including the immigration act of also called the anarchist exclusion act
illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period
despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement especially in the makhnovshchina however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government had stabilised including during the kronstadt rebellion
several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine before the bolsheviks crushed the anarchist movement there too
with the anarchists being repressed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism
the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party
seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements
in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international
in the spanish civil war of anarchists and syndicalists once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists
a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war and particularly in the spanish revolution of
in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land
the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight between communists and other leftists in a series of events known as the may days as joseph stalin asserted soviet control of the republican government ending in another defeat of anarchists at the hands of the communists
by the end of world war ii the anarchist movement had been severely weakened
the s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war
during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti nuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the s and the new left
it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti capitalist reformism
anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols
the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism
black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic
this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america
around the turn of the st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements
anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization the group of eight and the world economic forum
during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police
other organisational tactics pioneered at this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet
a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the seattle wto conference
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria
while having revolutionary aspirations many forms of anarchism are not confrontational nowadays
instead they are trying to build an alternative way of social organization based on mutual interdependence and voluntary cooperation
scholar carissa honeywell takes the example of food not bombs group of collectives to highlight some features of how anarchist groups work direct action working together and in solidarity with those left behind
while doing so they inform about the rising rates of world hunger suggest a policy to tackle hunger ranging from de funding the arms industry to addressing monsanto seed saving policies and patents helping farmers and commodification of food and housing
honeywell also emphasizes that contemporary anarchists are interested in the flourishing not only of humans but non humans and the environment as well
honeywell argues that escalation of problems such as continuous wars and world poverty show that the current framework not only cannot solve those pressing problems for humanity but are causal factors as well resulting in the rejection of representative democracy and the state as a whole
anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution
the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership
in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late th century and the post classical currents developed thereafter
beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy
anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy
anarchisms emphasis on anti capitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism
anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum
much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist libertarian and radical interpretations of left wing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories
as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely
one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mrmol in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time
belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists
despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authority and decentralisation
inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism
they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism
they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society
mutualism is an th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon
its aims include abolishing the state reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people
mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism
in what is property proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property
collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin
collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism
collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
anarcho communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production held by a federal network of voluntary associations with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need
anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international
it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late th century
anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers
the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers self management
individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants
early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau
through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation
anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left
interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation
as the movement shaped st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest
anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches
the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents
contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence
its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory
various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement
while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently
gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarcho communists
anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government economic class systems autocratic religions patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism
anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed
the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions
this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy
anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends
a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other
evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two
anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century
anarchists during the early th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches
during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency
not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed
assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful
anarchists also took part in revolutions
many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state
many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late s the early s and the s with some still occurring in the early s
their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions
anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial
anarcho pacifists advocate for non violence means to achieve their stateless nonviolent ends
other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism
this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible
emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil
anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist
they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism
anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism
those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media
in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards
both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies
members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included
overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors
they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico
militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening
anarchists commonly employ direct action
this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives
decision making is often handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism
contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations
in contrast with the big a anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term small a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre joseph proudhon to justify their opinions
those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize
the decision making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role
anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group
one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point
minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values
anarchists usually form small groups to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members
these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks
anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate
as in the past newspapers and journals are used and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message
anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals
anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free
the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance
anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces
during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal
as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action
acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds
adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity
as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common
its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory
the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism
anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines
phenomena such as civilisation technology and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others
objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism
anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies
instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite
authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people
another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption
anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society
specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary
robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate
bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be
john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely
beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ
as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy many anarchists address analyse and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles
sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing
sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men
a historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love
in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory relationship anarchy and queer anarchism
free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men
the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure
those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together
free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love
anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage and pro choice and had a similar agenda
anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another
during the second half of the th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well
by the latest decades of the th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents
with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a post structuralist critique of sexual normality
some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation
the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism
anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid
anarchist writers such as william godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges
in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church
ferrers approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance
ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students
the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested
nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world
christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free
in a similar token a
neill founded what became the summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion
anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation
ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism
late th century and contemporary anarchist writers intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society
contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality
while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions
judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american canadian network of schools the self managed learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain
the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others
in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement
in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk
anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life
other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends
in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris rob claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism
throughout the th century many prominent anarchists and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts
three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists
it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests
as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect
the th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism
in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community
the most common critique of anarchism is the assertion that humans cannot self govern and so a state is necessary for human survival
philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that eace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government
another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self governing a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism
another criticism of anarchism is that it is inherently unstable an anarchist society would inevitably evolve back into a state
thomas hobbes and other early social contract theorists argued that the state emerges in response to natural anarchy in order to protect the peoples interests and keep order
philosopher robert nozick argued that a night watchman state or minarchy would emerge out of anarchy through the process of an invisible hand in which people would exercise their liberty and buy protection from protection agencies evolving into a minimal state
anarchists reject these criticisms by arguing that humans in a state of nature would not just be in a state of war
anarcho primitivists in particular argue that humans were better off in a state of nature in small tribes living close to the land while anarchists in general argue that the negatives of state organization such as hierarchies monopolies and inequality outweigh the benefits
philosophy lecturer andrew g
fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world such as at protests but in the world of ethics as well
secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically
this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it
the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory as a ruling theory that has no ruling theory
anarchism also calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken
lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong
philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as a
john simmons moral principles and political obligations
law professor william a
edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious
edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate
in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion
one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority
joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success
raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction
anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment
anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively
classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering
friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticised anarchisms anti authoritarianism as inherently counter revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian
academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas
the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values
according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence
marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act
in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining
albedo is the fraction of sunlight that is diffusely reflected by a body
it is measured on a scale from to
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee received by a surface
the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface
these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time
while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
the temporal resolution may range from seconds to daily monthly or annual averages
unless given for a specific wavelength albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface
this spectrum includes visible light which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright
ice albedo feedback is a positive feedback climate process where a change in the area of ice caps glaciers and sea ice alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet
ice is very reflective therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water
ice albedo feedback plays an important role in global climate change
albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management
the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms
most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss
as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance
these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo
earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about
if earth were frozen entirely the average temperature of the planet would drop below
if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about
in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost
in scientists reported that earth dimmed by over two decades as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques
this may have both been co caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming
however the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend
this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
human activities change the albedo of various areas around the globe
as per campra et al
human impacts to the physical properties of the land surface can perturb the climate by altering the earths radiative energy balance even on a small scale or when undetected by satellites
the tens of thousands of hectares of greenhouses in almera spain form a large expanse of whitened plastic roofs
a study found that this anthropogenic change lowered the local surface area temperature of the high albedo area although changes were localized
a follow up study found that co eq
emissions associated to changes in surface albedo are a consequence of land transformation and can reduce surface temperature increases associated with climate change
it has been found that urbanization generally decreases albedo which contributes to global warming
deliberately increasing albedo in urban areas can mitigate urban heat island
ouyang et al
estimated that on a global scale an albedo increase of in worldwide urban areas would result in a cooling effect that is equivalent to absorbing gt of co emissions
intentionally enhancing the albedo of the earths surface along with its daytime thermal emittance has been proposed as a solar radiation management strategy to mitigate energy crises and global warming known as passive daytime radiative cooling
efforts toward widespread implementation of pdrcs may focus on maximizing the albedo of surfaces from very low to high values so long as a thermal emittance of at least can be achieved
albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location
that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude
albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation
tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation
because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth
this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker and reflects less heat back into space
this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect
albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather
the response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks increased by self reinforcing or positive feedbacks and reduced by balancing or negative feedbacks
the main reinforcing feedbacks are the water vapour feedback the ice albedo feedback and the net effect of clouds
when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results
a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling
in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback
however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight cause melting
when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating
snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snow
over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack
just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water
sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow
when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases
the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts
as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback
both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming
cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets
the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates
because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions
albedo works on a smaller scale too
in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions
research showed impacts of over for vertically mounted systems but such effects were substantially lower for systems with lower surface tilts
spectral albedo strongly affects the performance of bifacial solar cells where rear surface performance gains of over have been observed for c si cells installed above healthy vegetation
an analysis on the bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials provided effective albedo values for simulating the performance of seven photovoltaic materials mounted on three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications
forests generally have a low albedo because the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis
for this reason the greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation
in other words the climate change mitigation effect of carbon sequestration by forests is partially counterbalanced in that reforestation can decrease the reflection of sunlight
in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration
the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds
scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate
mid to high latitude forests have a much lower albedo during snow seasons than flat ground thus contributing to warming
modeling that compares the effects of albedo differences between forests and grasslands suggests that expanding the land area of forests in temperate zones offers only a temporary mitigation benefit
in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to
variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy
the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative effect of albedo change and effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes were neutral or perhaps warming
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs
incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator
however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction
because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
note that white caps on waves look white because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities
fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies
aerosols have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance
the direct effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect is less certain
as per spracklen et al
the effects are in extremely polluted cities like delhi aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day
another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is w m with a range to w m
black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo
in astronomy the term albedo can be defined in several different ways depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved
the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of
another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of
many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about
a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of
such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds
the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect
although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies
two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the geometric albedo and the bond albedo
their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion
in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single scattering albedo
it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
it depends on properties of the material the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
formula where formula is the astronomical albedo formula is the diameter in kilometers and formula is the absolute magnitude
in planetary radar astronomy a microwave pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target and the echo from the target is measured
in most instances the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse and the opposite sense
the echo power is measured in terms of radar cross section formula formula or formula and is equal to the cross sectional area of a metallic sphere at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power
those components of the received echo that return from first surface reflections are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection
if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering
formula where the denominator is the effective cross sectional area of the target object with mean radius formula
a smooth metallic sphere would have formula
the values reported for the moon mercury mars venus and comet p jq are derived from the total radar albedo reported in those references
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria
a or a is the first letter and the first vowel of the latin alphabet used in the modern english alphabet the alphabets of other western european languages and others worldwide
its name in english is a plural aes
it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha from which it derives
the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
the lowercase version can be written in two forms the double storey a and single storey
the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type
in english grammar a and its variant an are indefinite articles
the earliest known certain ancestor of a is aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants
in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eighth century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged
the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english
during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a
first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media
there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces
due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule
variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles
the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial
at the end of the roman empire several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe
among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain
by the ninth century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press
this form was derived through a combining of prior forms
th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today
these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version
the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right
this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers
the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it
both derive from the majuscule form
in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown
many fonts then made the right leg vertical
in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form
graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker a and double decker a respectively
italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest
there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a
the double sequence does not occur in native english words but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark
however occurs in many common digraphs all with their own sound or sounds particularly and
in most languages that use the latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or
an exception is saanich in which stands for a close mid front unrounded vowel
in algebra the letter a along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a variable with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics
moreover in ren descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x y and z and knowns by a b and c and this convention is still often followed especially in elementary algebra
in geometry capital a b c etc
are used to denote segments lines rays etc
a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a
a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a a or a the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork a grade for clean restaurants a list celebrities etc
such associations can have a motivating effect as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters
a is used as a prefix on some words such as asymmetry to mean not or without
in english grammar a and its variant an is an indefinite article used to introduce noun phrases
finally the letter a is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere
these are the code points for the forms of the letter in various systems in the hexadecimal numbering system a is a number that corresponds to the number in decimal counting
alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the united states bordered by tennessee to the north georgia to the east florida and the gulf of mexico to the south and mississippi to the west
alabama is the th largest by area and the th most populous of the us states
alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state after the state bird
alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state
the state tree is the longleaf pine and the state flower is the camellia
alabamas capital is montgomery and its largest city by population and area is huntsville
its oldest city is mobile founded by french colonists in as the capital of french louisiana
greater birmingham is alabamas largest metropolitan area and its economic center
originally home to many native tribes present day alabama was a spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the french acquired it in the early eighteenth century
the british won the territory in until losing it in the american revolutionary war
spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until
in december alabama was recognized as a state
during the antebellum period alabama was a major producer of cotton and widely used african american slave labor
in the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america with montgomery acting as its first capital and rejoined the union in
following the american civil war alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the states economy
similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws from the late th century up until the s
high profile events such as the selma to montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the s and s
during and after world war ii alabama grew as the states economy diversified with new industries
nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville would help alabamas economic growth in the mid to late th century by developing an aerospace industry
alabamas economy in the st century is based on automotive finance tourism manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology
the states geography is diverse with the north dominated by the mountainous tennessee valley and the south by mobile bay a historically significant port
politically as part of the deep south alabama is predominantly a conservative state and is known for its southern culture
within alabama american football particularly at the college level plays a major part of the states culture
the european american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people a muskogean speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river
in the alabama language the word for a person of alabama lineage is
the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega used while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in transliterations of the term
as early as the french called the tribe the with french maps identifying the river as
other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamou
and possibly alabahmu
the use of state names derived from native american languages is common in the us an estimated states have names of native american origin
sources disagree on the words meaning
some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw and
the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants
the state has numerous place names of native american origin
however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language
an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest
this notion was popularized in the s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek
experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation
indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization
trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period and continued until european contact
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ce with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama
this is the second largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in present day illinois which was the center of the culture
analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex
contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently
the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood
among the historical tribes of native american people living in present day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogean speaking alabama chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati
while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages
the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama during their exploration of north america in the th century
the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in
more than years later the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile in
the city was moved to the current site of mobile in
this area was claimed by the french from to as part of la louisiane
after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from to
after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain
the latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to us forces on april
thomas bassett a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile
he settled in the tombigbee district during the early s
the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county
what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and was finally added to the mississippi territory in
most of what is now the northern two thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period
it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards
following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia although heavily disputed
with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower one third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in
the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal
spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams ons treaty officially ceded it to the united states in
before mississippis admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory
the united states congress created the alabama territory on march
stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to
alabama was admitted as the nd state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention
from july to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution
huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county
cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to
the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation
part of the frontier in the s and s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded
the economy of the central black belt was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor
the area also drew many poor disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers
alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by
most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in
from to tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital
on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery
the first legislative session in the new capital met in december
a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia
the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in
this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day
it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine
by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color
on january alabama declared its secession from the union
after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america
the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery
alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war
although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky
the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails
this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army
alabamas slaves were freed by the th amendment in
alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in
from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state
alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s
turner and james t
following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton
during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights
legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation
organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans
besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league
reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence
they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools
the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools
railroad passenger cars were segregated in
the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor european americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test
the constitution required racial segregation of public schools
by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate
this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in
the numbers dropped even more in later decades
the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the s jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
by whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs
african americans
nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote
despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement
the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens
the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes
partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools
in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs
the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest
black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas
they often donated land and labor as well
beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children
a total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state
several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places
continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the th century as part of the great migration out of the south
reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama dropped by nearly half from to
at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city
by birmingham was the th largest city in the united states
heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy
its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution
this did not change until the late s following a lawsuit and court order
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war
rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile
between and more than people moved into the city to work for war related industries
cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
despite massive population changes in the state from to the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
one result was that jefferson county containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services
urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature
a study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature
in the united states supreme court cases of baker v
carr and reynolds v
sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties
african americans continued to press in the s and s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges
in the us supreme court ruled in brown v
board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply
during the s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation
the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches
these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the us congress
legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court
according to the new york times by many of alabamas african americans were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery
also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american
these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry

sims the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems
at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts
this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas
for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state budget but jefferson county received only th of state services in funding

the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the alabama constitutional commission
legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county
united states supreme court decisions in baker v
carr required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote
before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties

in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war the greatest of all the greek warriors and the central character of homers iliad
he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia
achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy
although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him with an arrow
later legends state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels
alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution
the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends
linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a ki re u and a ki re we the latter being the dative of the former
the name grew more popular becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form attested in attica in the fourth century bc and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon
achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in a proto form akh luos he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress
the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad
achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of
furthermore las has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster
with this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war
the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership
some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a pre greek language
achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity
robert s
beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of and in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language
in the account of dares the phrygian achilles was described having
a large chest a fine mouth and powerfully formed arms and legs
his head was covered with long wavy chestnut colored hair
though mild in manner he was very fierce in battle
his face showed the joy of a man richly endowed
achilles was the son of thetis a nereid and daughter of the old man of the sea and peleus the king of the myrmidons
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy that thetis would bear a son greater than his father
for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods
thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus
zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal
according to the achilleid written by statius in the st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier
in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage
none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability
to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaios son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander
he was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each hand one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood
in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel
in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow hit his torso
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur who lived on mount pelion to be reared
thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity
achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war
according to homer achilles grew up in phthia with his companion patroclus
according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus
when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron
later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot
some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of lycomedes king of skyros
there achilles properly disguised lived among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha cercysera or aissa
with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he raped achilles there fathered two sons neoptolemus and oneiros
according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid
odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods
when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign
in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women
while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away
according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons
he appointed five leaders menesthius eudorus peisander phoenix and alcimedon
when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus
in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal
guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy
according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound
achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge
alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed
according to the cypria when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities and killed tenes a son of apollo as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention
in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priams and hecubas five legitimate sons
despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer
prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him
yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios
later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace
in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents
had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides
homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war
achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem
the first two lines of the iliad read the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death
it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces
agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave
her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him
agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks
the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him
achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father
agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis
angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces
at the same time burning with rage over agamemnons theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour
as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior
agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix
they promise that if achilles returns to battle agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts
achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do
the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp
patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companions death
his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles
she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector
the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem
enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector
achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed
the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus
zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself
finally achilles finds his prey
achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face
after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable
wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses
accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him
achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me
achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot
after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion
at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orions dog a sign of evil
during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the evening western star while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus the morning eastern star has set
with the assistance of the god hermes hectors father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried
achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with a burial on the th
the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come
the aethiopis and a work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce relate further events from the trojan war
when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles
after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later
at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her
following the death of patroclus nestors son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion
when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon
consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon was also the son of a goddess
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the th century bc
the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors
the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times
in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship
homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations
although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors
commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures
in th century bc athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one usually a teenager
in patroclus and achilles case achilles would have been the younger as patroclus is usually seen as his elder
in platos symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover
however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women
many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship
the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions
starting with the oldest account in the iliad book xxii hector predicts with his last dying breath that paris and apollo will slay him at the scaean gates leading to troy
in book xxiii the sad spirit of dead patroclus visits achilles just as he drifts off into slumber requesting that his bones be placed with those of achilles in his golden vase a gift of his mother
in the odyssey book xi odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades
one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead
but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction
in the odyssey book xxiv we read dead king agamemnons ghostly account of his death achilles funeral pyre bleached bones had been mixed with those of patroclus and put into his mothers golden vase
also the bones of antilocus who had become closer to achilles than any other following patroclus death were separately enclosed
and the customary funeral games of a hero were performed and a massive tomb or mound was built on the hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate
achilles was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube
another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena
achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him
according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica
achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both mens presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour
furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades
after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide
odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles
when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus
the armour they fought for was made by hephaestus and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft
thetis had the gear made for achilles because his first set was worn by patroclus when he went to battle and taken by hector when he killed patroclus
the shield of achilles was also made by the fire god
his legendary spear was given to him by his mentor chiron before he participated in the trojan war
it was called the pelian spear which allegedly no other man could wield
a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf
the city was visited in bc by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the nd century ce
numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions
at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game
they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle
the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena
the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla
achilles cult was also to be found at other places e
on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had a sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero
the cult of achilles is illustrated in the bc polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles
strabo also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus todays black sea appears to have been remarkable
an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island
early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards
the cult was still thriving in the third century ce when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontrchs who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon
pliny the elder in his natural history mentions a port of the achi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him
this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly roman miles away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states
in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron
the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake island
plinys contemporary pomponius mela tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion
ruins of a square temple measuring meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island
a second exploration in showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple
a fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke
in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra regional hero veneration
the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical
already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus
well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it
guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death
the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who likely lived during the first century ce wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white
it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour
similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there
pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame
in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue
leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing
pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound
ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters on the island
strabo mentioned that the cape of the racecourse of achilles was sacred to achilles and although it was treeless was called alsos
alsos in greek means grove
a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles
herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achlleion built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad
later attestations point to an achlleion in messenia and an achlleios in laconia
nicolae densuianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law
the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus
alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor
he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy
in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus
the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars
the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel
extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play
the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today
in platos symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him
the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character
only a few fragments survive
towards the end of the th century bc a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis
the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible
as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions
in hippias minor a socratic dialogue attributed to plato an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates
the two get into a discussion about lying
they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying
socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point
the two also reference homer extensively
socrates and hippias agree that odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle was false intentionally
achilles like odysseus told numerous falsehoods
hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit
the two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident
socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally
the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles
virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children
other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career
this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benot de sainte maures and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the th century

thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky before losing all but of his land in court disputes over property titles
in the family moved to indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable
indiana was a free territory and they settled in an unbroken forest in hurricane township perry county indiana

in march fearing another milk sickness outbreak several members of the extended lincoln family including abraham moved west to illinois a free state and settled in macon county
abraham then became increasingly distant from thomas in part due to his fathers lack of education
in as thomas and other family members prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county illinois abraham struck out on his own
he made his home in new salem illinois for six years
lincoln and some friends took goods including live hogs by flatboat to new orleans louisiana where he first witnessed slavery
on january abraham lincoln then twenty eight years old delivered his first major speech at the lyceum in springfield illinois after the murder of newspaper editor elijah parish lovejoy in alton
lincoln warned that no trans atlantic military giant could ever crush us as a nation
it cannot come from abroad
if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher said lincoln
in essay on lincolns lyceum speech former illinois congressman and senator paul simon noted that politically cautious he did not mention lovejoy but denounced mob action and everyone present knew why
in alton campaign to end free speech two murders that provoked lincoln to run for president zann gill describes how two murders set off a chain reaction that prompted abraham lincoln to run for president
first an innocent black man francis mcintosh was burned alive in st
louis missouri on april
the brutal murder of francis mcintosh and its dismissal in court transformed lovejoy from a moderate into an abolitionist
for speaking out against burning a black man alive lovejoy was forced to leave missouri a slave state
he moved across the river to alton illinois taking his newspaper the st
louis observer with him where it became the alton observer
but the free state of illinois was not a safe harbor for escaped slaves nor for an abolitionist editor
on november lovejoy was murdered by a mob of white men in formal evening dress top hats and swallowtail coats
soon after abraham lincoln delivered his lyceum speech in springfield illinois just north of alton starting his twenty year path toward the presidency
speculation persists that lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he moved to new salem
witness testimony given decades afterward showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two
rutledge died on august most likely of typhoid fever saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on anns grave lincoln sunk into a serious episode of depression and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her
in the early s he met mary owens from kentucky
late in lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem
owens arrived that november and he courted her for a time however they both had second thoughts
on august he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship and she never replied
in lincoln met mary todd in springfield illinois and the following year they became engaged
she was the daughter of robert smith todd a wealthy lawyer and businessman in lexington kentucky
a wedding set for january was canceled at lincolns request but they reconciled and married on november in the springfield mansion of marys sister
while anxiously preparing for the nuptials he was asked where he was going and replied to hell i suppose
in the couple bought a house in springfield near his law office
mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative
lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons though his work regularly kept him away from home
the oldest robert todd lincoln was born in and was the only child to live to maturity
edward baker lincoln born in died february probably of tuberculosis
lincolns third son willie lincoln was born on december and died of a fever at the white house on february
the youngest thomas tad lincoln was born on april and survived his father but died of heart failure at age on july
lincoln was remarkably fond of children and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own
in fact lincolns law partner william h
herndon would grow irritated when lincoln brought his children to the law office
their father it seemed was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior
herndon recounted i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut
lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done
the deaths of their sons eddie and willie had profound effects on both parents
lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition now thought to be clinical depression
later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and robert committed her for a time to an asylum in
during and lincoln worked at a general store in new salem illinois
in he declared his candidacy for the illinois house of representatives but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war
when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war he planned to become a blacksmith but instead formed a partnership with william berry with whom he purchased a new salem general store on credit
because a license was required to sell customers single beverages berry obtained bartending licenses for each for lincoln and himself and in the lincoln berry general store became a tavern as well
as licensed bartenders lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits including liquor for cents a pint
they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food including takeout dinners
but berry became an alcoholic was often too drunk to work and lincoln ended up running the store by himself
although the economy was booming the business struggled and went into debt causing lincoln to sell his share
in his first campaign speech after returning from his military service lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack grabbed the assailant by his neck and the seat of his trousers and tossed him
in the campaign lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the sangamon river
he could draw crowds as a raconteur but lacked the requisite formal education powerful friends and money and lost the election
lincoln finished eighth out of candidates though he received of the votes cast in the new salem precinct
lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer
rather than studying in the office of an established attorney as was the custom lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys john todd stuart and thomas drummond purchased books including blackstones commentaries and chittys pleadings and read law on his own
he later said of his legal education that i studied with nobody
lincolns second state house campaign in this time as a whig was a success over a powerful whig opponent
then followed his four terms in the illinois house of representatives for sangamon county
he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal and later was a canal commissioner
he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males but adopted a free soil stance opposing both slavery and abolition
in he declared institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils
he echoed henry clays support for the american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia
he was admitted to the illinois bar on september and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john t
stuart mary todds cousin
lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross examinations and closing arguments
he partnered several years with stephen t
logan and in began his practice with william herndon a studious young man
true to his record lincoln professed to friends in to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay
their party favored economic modernization in banking tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and urbanization
in lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinois th district seat in the us house of representatives he was defeated by john j
hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term
lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in but also won the election
he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line
he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department
lincoln teamed with joshua r
giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter
he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support
on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke against the mexican american war which he imputed to president james k
polks desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood
he supported the wilmot proviso a failed proposal to ban slavery in any us territory won from mexico
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions
the war had begun with a killing of american soldiers by mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil
lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil
the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political support in his district
one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln
lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on presidential war making powers
lincoln had pledged in to serve only one term in the house
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the presidential election
taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the general land office
the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation
this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice
in his springfield practice lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer
twice a year he appeared for consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts this continued for years
lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges
as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him
he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v
rock island bridge company a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge
in he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water
the idea was never commercialized but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent
lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in cases he was sole counsel in cases of which were decided in his favor
from to one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad
his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe
lincoln argued in an criminal trial defending william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness
after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility
armstrong was acquitted
leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent rev
peter cartwright
harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison
lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay
lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule
instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrisons acquittal
the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave holding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of a legislative package designed to address the issue
in his eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue
as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen a
douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery
the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result but douglass kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may
lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech of october
lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency
he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery
i cannot but hate it
i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself
i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world
lincolns attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life
nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue
reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist
i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists
lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement
in lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat
the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas nebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate
at that time senators were elected by the state legislature
after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain a majority
lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull
trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig
lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson
violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong throughout the north
as the elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party
the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state
lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union
at the june republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john c
frmont and william dayton comprised the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois
the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore
buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois
dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the missouri compromise
after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom
his petition was denied in dred scott v
in his opinion supreme court chief justice roger b
taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution and that the missouri compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners property rights
while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north
lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power
he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
in douglas was up for re election in the us senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him
many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in and lincolns campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor
some eastern republicans supported douglas for his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state
many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference
for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition
lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal
after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing or all the other
the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion
the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas
when informed of lincolns nomination douglas stated is the strong man of the party
and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won
the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas
these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands
the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically
lincoln warned that douglas slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal
douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine in which he said local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists
lincolns argument assumed a moral tone as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery
douglass argument was more legal in nature claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the us supreme court as exercised in the dred scott decision
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas
however lincolns articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence
in may lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger a german language newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the states german americans voted for democrats but the german language paper mobilized republican support
in the aftermath of the election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william h
seward salmon p
chase edward bates and simon cameron
while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office
in january lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy
over the coming months lincoln was tireless making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail
by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric he quickly became the champion of the republican party
however despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states he was less appreciated in the east
horace greeley editor of the new york tribune at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred scott ruling which was promptly used against him by his political rivals
on february powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery
he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly
but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention
journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience
historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant
appearing in sewards home state sponsored by a group largely loyal to chase lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these republican rivals for the nomination
in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my mouth a little
on may the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement
exploiting his embellished frontier legend lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate
in lincoln described himself i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark complexion with coarse black hair and gray eyes
michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign
at times he was presented as the plain talking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe unpolished but trustworthy
on may at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase
a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket
lincolns success depended on his campaign team his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff
pennsylvania put him over the top led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support
lincolns managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincolns dictate to make no contracts that will bind me
as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party
throughout the s lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession
when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglass position on popular sovereignty and selected incumbent vice president john c
breckinridge as their candidate
a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee
lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south
prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties
people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln
as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party
the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials
republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story emphasizing his childhood poverty
the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts
the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold copies
though he did not give public appearances many sought to visit him and write him
in the runup to the election he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention
he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary who would remain in that role during the presidency
on november lincoln was elected the th president
he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west
no ballots were cast for him in of the southern slave states and he won only two of counties in all the southern states an omen of the impending civil war
lincoln received votes or of the total in a four way race carrying the free northern states as well as california and oregon
his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had votes to for his opponents
the south was outraged by lincolns election and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march
on december south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed
six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america and adopted a constitution
the upper south and border states initially rejected the secessionist appeal
president buchanan and president elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal
the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february
attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of free soil in the territories
lincoln said i will suffer death before i consent
to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right
lincoln supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office
that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed
on march in his first inaugural address lincoln said that because he holds such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable
a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution
on february lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield he would never again return to springfield alive
lincoln traveled east in a special train
due to secessionist plots a then unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train
en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north
the president elect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore
on february he arrived in disguise in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard
lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states major robert anderson commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent a request for provisions to washington and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war
on april confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight
historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war
donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft
sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood
but he also vowed not to surrender the forts
the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that
on april lincoln called on the states to send a total of volunteer troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states
this call forced states to choose sides
virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines
north carolina tennessee and arkansas followed over the following two months
secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky remained neutral
the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason dixon line to defend the nation
as states sent union regiments south on april baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains
local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials
lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington
john merryman one maryland official hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger b
taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus
in june in ex parte merryman taney not ruling on behalf of the supreme court issued the writ believing that article i section of the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend it
but lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas
lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy
he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander in chief by exercising unprecedented authority
he expanded his war powers imposed a blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers
lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions
lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict
it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions
copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery
the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
on august lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates
the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery
in august general john c
frmont the republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels
lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity
as a result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over
internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy
he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner
in the trent affair which threatened war with great britain the us navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered
lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats
biographer james g
randall dissected lincolns successful techniques lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department
he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party
in january after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton
stanton centralized the war departments activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government
stanton was a staunch unionist pro business conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction
he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official
stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman
lincolns war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was well defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt decisive victory
twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon
occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard
for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoine henri jomini
lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river
lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than merely capturing territory
in directing the unions war strategy lincoln valued the advice of gen
winfield scott even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army
on june president lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department
after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement lincoln appointed major general george b
mcclellan general in chief
mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign
mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington
mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capital
in lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction
he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia
pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack
but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington
two days after mcclellans return to command general robert e
lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam
that battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january
mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee
lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside
the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part
burnside against presidential advice launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december
desertions during came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker
in the midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market
the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations
in the spring of lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned and was replaced by george meade
meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands
at the same time grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river splitting the far western rebel states
the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states
lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented because these territories would be admitted to the union as free states and free states would come to outnumber slave states
he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves
lincoln rejected major general john c
frmonts august emancipation attempt as well as one by major general david hunter in may on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede
in june congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory which lincoln signed
in july the confiscation act of was enacted providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional
he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander in chief which he planned to exercise
on july lincoln reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet
peace democrats argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification but republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune in his public letter the prayer of twenty millions implored lincoln to embrace emancipation
in a public letter of august lincoln replied to greeley writing that while he personally wished all men could be free his first obligation as president was to preserve the union on september lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation which announced that in states still in rebellion on january the slaves would be freed
he spent the next days between september and january preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites
at the same time during those days lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact
but on january keeping his word lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves in states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas under such control
lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper
with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective union armies advancing south enable thousands of slaves to escape to freedom
the emancipation proclamation having stated that freedmen would be received into the armed service of the united states enlisting these freedmen became official policy
by the spring of lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers
in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of fifty thousand armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once
by the end of at lincolns direction general lorenzo thomas had enrolled twenty regiments of african americans from the mississippi valley
lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november
in words and three minutes lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in but in conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all
he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end and the future of democracy would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
defying his prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history
general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln
responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i cant spare this man
he fights
with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters while also including black troops
meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander
grant then assumed command of meades army
lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in
he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions and once assured that he had none lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington
authorization for such a promotion with the advice and consent of the senate was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate
his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march
grant in waged the bloody overland campaign which exacted heavy losses on both sides
when lincoln asked what grants plans were the persistent general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer
grants army moved steadily south
lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman
lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north
lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure plantations railroads and bridges hoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability
he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction for its own sake
lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in when confederate general jubal early raided washington dc legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position union captain oliver wendell holmes jr shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot as grant continued to weaken lees forces efforts to discuss peace began
confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads
lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal his objective to end the fighting was not realized
on april grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege
the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital
on april lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war
lincoln ran for reelection in while uniting the main republican factions along with war democrats edwin m
stanton and andrew johnson
lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers greatly expanded from peacetime to build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him
at its convention the republicans selected johnson as his running mate
to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party
grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns re election prospects and many republicans feared defeat
lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope
the pledge read as follows the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure but their candidate mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform
meanwhile lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support
shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism
the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln
the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation
state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads
on november lincoln carried all but three states including percent of union soldiers
on march lincoln delivered his second inaugural address
in it he deemed the war casualties to be gods will
historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semi sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial
lincoln said reconstruction preceded the wars end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves
when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy
lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states
his main goal was to keep the union together so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame but on how to rebuild the nation as one
lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals under rep
thaddeus stevens sen
charles sumner and sen
benjamin wade who otherwise remained lincolns allies
determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held
his amnesty proclamation of december offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance
as southern states fell they needed leaders while their administrations were restored
in tennessee and arkansas lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors
in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p
banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when percent of the voters agreed and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery
democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations
the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wade davis bill which lincoln vetoed
the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee
lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals
to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court he named the radicals choice salmon p
chase who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies
after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment
he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december an amendment was brought to congress
the senate passed it on april but the first vote in the house of representatives fell short of the required two thirds majority
passage became part of lincolns reelection platform and after his successful reelection the second attempt in the house passed on january
with ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december
lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen
he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves
the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen
lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short term military control pending readmission under the control of southern unionists
historians agree that it is impossible to predict how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived
biographers james g
randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that lincolns experience with native americans started early with their killing of his grandfather in front of the family
later he served as a captain in the state militia during the black hawk war but saw no combat
during his presidency his policy toward indians was based on politics
he used appointments to the indian bureau as a reward to supporters from minnesota and wisconsin
while in office his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraphs from indian attacks
on august the sioux or dakota uprising broke out in minnesota
hundreds of settlers were killed were displaced from their homes and washington was deeply alarmed
some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier
lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising
when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians lincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in minnesota
lincoln sent general john pope to minnesota as commander of the new department of the northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities
before he arrived the fond du lac band of chippewa sent lincoln a letter begging to go to war for the united states against the sioux so lincoln could send minnesotas troops to fight the south
in it the chippewa specified that they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare
that meant there would be no prisoners of war no surrender no peace agreement
lincoln did not accept the chippewa offer as he had no means to control the outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native american warfare
once word reached the other bands of chippewa he had no way of knowing how they would react to his sending the fond du lac on the warpath
one of the chippewa signing the letter chief naw gaw nub had received a presidential medal from lincoln earlier in the year
serving under gen
pope was minnesota congressman henry h
minnesotas governor had made sibley a colonel united states volunteers to command the us force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated little crows forces at the battle of wood lake
the day the mdewakanton force surrendered at camp release a chippewa war council met at minnesotas capitol with another chippewa offer to lincoln to fight the sioux
sibley thought he had to of men he wanted for trial while gen
pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried
when it was done had been given death sentences that were subject to presidential review
lincoln ordered gen pope send all of the trial transcripts to washington where he and two of his staff pored over the trials
the lawyer in lincoln saw issues
he slowly realized that the trials could be divided into two groups combat between combatants and combat against civilians
the groups could be identified by their transcripts the first group were all just three pages in length while the second group had more pages some up to twelve
he placed cases into the first group and commuted their sentences for the largest mass commutation in history
into the second group went forty
one he commuted for turning states witness
sibley dismissed another when overwhelming proof surfaced exonerating the man
the remaining were executed in the largest mass hanging in us history
very quickly questions arose concerning three of the executions that have not been answered
less than four months after the executions lincoln issued general order that relates more to the minnesota war than the civil war
now a congressman alexander ramsey told lincoln in that he would have gotten more re election support in minnesota had he executed all of the mdewakanton
lincoln responded i could not afford to hang men for votes
the men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at davenport iowa
a few of those he had released due to the efforts of bishop henry whipple
lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating
lincoln vetoed only four bills including the wade davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program
the homestead act made millions of acres of western government held land available for purchase at low cost
the morrill land grant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state
the pacific railway acts of and granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in
the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the s
in the selection and use of his cabinet lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency
lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet
we needed to hold our own people together
i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men
then i had no right to deprive the country of their services
goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals
there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs and a federal income tax
in lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs following the first enacted by buchanan
he also signed the revenue act of creating the first us income tax a flat tax of percent on incomes above
the revenue act of adopted rates that increased with income
the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas
the national banking act created the system of national banks
the us issued paper currency for the first time known as greenbacks printed in green on the reverse side
in congress created the department of agriculture
in response to rumors of a renewed draft the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market
lincoln attacked the media for such behavior and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days
lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday
thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the th century
it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates
the prior proclamation had been during james madisons presidency years earlier
in lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving
in june lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park
lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it
therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known
lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court
noah haynes swayne was an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union
samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the election and was an avowed abolitionist
david davis was lincolns campaign manager in and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced
democrat stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice provided geographic and political balance
finally lincolns treasury secretary salmon p
chase became chief justice
lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party
lincoln named his main political rival william h
seward as secretary of state and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio
however lincoln did select some of the top diplomats as part of his patronage policy
he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late to make sure there was no escalation into a war with britain
sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy
he was successful after indicating to britain and france that the union would declare war on them if they supported the south
john wilkes booth was a well known actor and a confederate spy from maryland though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service
after attending an april speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president
when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre
lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse
at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play
on april hours before he was assassinated lincoln signed legislation establishing the united states secret service and at in the evening booth entered the back of lincolns theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincolns head mortally wounding him
lincolns guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped
after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house
after remaining in a coma for eight hours lincoln died at in the morning on april
stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages
lincolns body was placed in a flag wrapped coffin which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers
president johnson was sworn in later that same day
two weeks later booth refusing to surrender was tracked to a farm in virginia and was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april
secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed
after a brief interview stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge
the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april to april
the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train
the train followed a circuitous route from washington dc to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands
many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief
poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him one of four poems he wrote about lincoln
african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses
in a larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war
historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death
lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb
as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic
he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it
he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others
he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs
throughout his public career lincoln often quoted scripture
his three most famous speeches the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture
in the s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power
with the death of his son edward in he more frequently expressed a dependence on god
he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in
in the s lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence
the death of his son willie in february may have caused him to look toward religion for solace
after willies death he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity
he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest
yet the contest began
and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day
yet the contest proceeds
lincoln did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by was expressing that belief in major speeches
by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april to a newspaper editor in kentucky this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least
lincoln explains therein that the cause purpose and result of the war was gods will
lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants
on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land
lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria
he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation
it is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning
several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination
these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting
it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type b
lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry v
jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman j
lincoln called the declaration of independence which emphasized freedom and equality for all the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the s
he did this at a time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse
diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the cooper union speech
instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism
his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract
furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state
many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs
as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats
lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise
nevertheless lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism
according to historian sean wilentz william c
harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism
james g
randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform
randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders
in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy
he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints
he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people
the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country
the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural and other times in the singular
the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the th century
in surveys of us scholars ranking presidents conducted since the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies
between and lincoln john f
kennedy and ronald reagan have been the top ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys according to gallup
a study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington
lincolns assassination left him a national martyr
he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty
republicans linked lincolns name to their party
many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability
historians have said he was a classical liberal in the th century sense
allen c
guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democrat an enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office
sociologist barry schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late th century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners
the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt
in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state
schwartz argues that in the s and s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life
during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful
franklin d
roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan
americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness
he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept
in the cold war years lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes
he had long been known as the great emancipator but by the late s some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr denied that lincoln deserved that title
bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in
he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks
bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country
the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them
defenders of lincoln such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible
dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously pointing to his narrow political agenda and faulty research
by the s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives apart from neo confederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white south for his intense nationalism his support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery his acting on lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers
lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world
barry schwartz wrote in that lincolns image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late th century
on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason
in the st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies
lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light
lincoln has been also admired by political figures outside the us including german political theorist karl marx indian independence leader mahatma gandhi former liberian president ellen johnson sirleaf and libyan revolutionary muammar gaddafi
lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny and the bill
his likeness also appears on many postage stamps
while he is usually portrayed bearded he did not grow a beard until at the suggestion of year old grace bedell
he was the first of five presidents to do so
he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the capital of nebraska
the united states navy is named after lincoln the second navy ship to bear his name
the lincoln memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital and is one of the top five most visited national park service sites in the country
fords theatre among the most visited sites in washington dc is across the street from petersen house where lincoln died
memorials in springfield illinois include the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum lincolns home and his tomb
a portrait carving of lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on mount rushmore which receives about million visitors a year
an stands in lincoln park chicago with recastings given as diplomatic gifts standing in parliament square london and parque lincoln mexico city
in congress officially dedicated room h in the us capitol to abraham lincoln
the room is located off of national statuary hall and previously served as the post office of the house while then representative abraham lincoln served in congress from
aristotle was an ancient greek philosopher and polymath
his writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences philosophy linguistics economics politics psychology and the arts
as the founder of the peripatetic school of philosophy in the lyceum in athens he began the wider aristotelian tradition that followed which set the groundwork for the development of modern science
little is known about aristotles life
he was born in the city of stagira in northern greece during the classical period
his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian
at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven
shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored his son alexander the great beginning in bc
he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls
though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication
aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him
it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry
as a result his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion
aristotles views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship
the influence of physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed
some of aristotles zoological observations found in his biology such as on the hectocotyl arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the th century
he also influenced judeo islamic philosophies during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church
aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher while the poet dante called him the master of those who know
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan
aristotles influence on logic continued well into the th century
in addition his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics
in general the details of aristotles life are not well established
the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points
aristotle was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km east of modern day thessaloniki
his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon
while he was young aristotle learned about biology and medical information which was taught by his father
both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian
although little information about aristotles childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy
at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy
he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn
aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in bc
the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died
aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor
after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon
while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece
they had a daughter whom they also named pythias
in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon
during aristotles time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric
in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants
by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years
while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira
they had a son whom aristotle named after his father nicomachus
if the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages is accurate he may also have had an ermenos palaephatus of abydus
this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works
he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived
those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students
his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics
aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre
near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death
following alexanders death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled
in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athenss trial and execution of socrates
he died in chalcis euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife
with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th century advances in mathematical logic
kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion
what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism aristotle himself would have labelled analytics
the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics
most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers
the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers
the books are the order of the books is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings
it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms and dialectics
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning
the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics
the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics
aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science as the contemplative philosophy which is theological and studies the divine
he wrote in his metaphysics aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence in his metaphysics and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism
in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed
for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc
or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form
like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the universal
aristotles ontology places the universal in particulars things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate
for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance
plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things
when one looks at an apple for example one sees an apple and one can also analyse a form of an apple
in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple
moreover one can place an apple next to a book so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things
for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form
aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things
in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals
where plato spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated
so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms
coming to be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality and actuality in association with the matter and the form
referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else
for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially a plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant
potentially beings can either act or be acted upon which can be either innate or learned
for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning
actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality
because the end is the principle of every change and potentiality exists for the sake of the end actuality accordingly is the end
referring then to the previous example it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do
in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end
then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality
with this definition of the particular substance aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being and the actual one are one and the same
aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these
aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles
aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences
in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences
aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry
aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science
however his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method
for aristotle all science is either practical poetical or theoretical
his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics
in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry
in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions
aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets
aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens
in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction
with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster
this would imply the equation incorrect in modern physics
natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens while the empedoclean elements move vertically up or down towards their natural resting places
in the physics aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional to its weight w and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible
opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws
henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this
archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition
aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period
john philoponus and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect
a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air
in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium
newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus
aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors
his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here
aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems book
the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in
with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the suns image always remained circular
he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image
according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous
there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to peoples moral choices
in astronomy aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then
the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them
aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations
he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime
the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption
aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology
for example he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early and correctly that when seawater is heated freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings
he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos
his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas
his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived
aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen
he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus
his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the th century
he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark
he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has a long neck and long legs and a sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet
darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution
aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents
for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes
he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results
to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct
aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense
he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection
in generation of animals he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside
instead he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these
this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics
it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed
in this sense aristotles biology is scientific
from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods that he studied
among these correct predictions are the following
brood size decreases with body mass so that an elephant has fewer young per brood than a mouse
lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier
as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice
aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a nonreligious version of the scala naturae with man at the top
his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs
animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals
he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood
those with blood were divided into the live bearing and the egg laying
those without blood were insects crustacea and the hard shelled molluscs
he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods
to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution
philosophers of science have generally concluded that aristotle was not interested in taxonomy but zoologists who studied this question in the early st century think otherwise
he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design
aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul posits three kinds of soul the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul
humans have a rational soul
the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally
the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous and logos
for aristotle the soul is the form of a living being
because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement
in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain
notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon
in on the soul aristotle famously criticizes platos theory of the soul and develops his own in response to platos
the first criticism is against platos view of the soul in the timaeus that the soul takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies
th century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed aristotles interpretation of plato and maintained that he had misunderstood plato
todays scholars have tended to re assess aristotles interpretation and have warmed up to it
aristotles other criticism is that platos view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a soul and its body to be mis matched in principle aristotle alleges any soul can go with any body according to platos theory
aristotles claim that the soul is the form of a living being is meant to eliminate that possibility and thus rule out reincarnation
according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past
in other words a memory is a mental picture that can be recovered
aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory
a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once
these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian and thinking
aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents
memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present
retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly
a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences both for previous experience and present experience
because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences
to search for these impressions people search the memory itself
within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for
recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another
if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next
when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed
recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression
only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words
animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations
remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed
aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association
aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind
a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience
according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled
aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness
sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body
while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness
since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire which is the result of sensation
however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus
in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner
aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then looks away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion
when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression
when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored
however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences
so dreams result from these lasting impressions
since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience
during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind
aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus
for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings
since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person
this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature
in de anima iii aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia
one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs
he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being
aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences
aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it
if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred
secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream
for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream
lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences
aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric
aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake
he wrote several treatises on ethics most notably including the nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight
aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch in accordance with reason
aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being
to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom and their intellect can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher
in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics
aristotle considered the city to be a natural community
moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part
he famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and argued that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality
aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others
aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city which functions as a political community or partnership
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together
this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences
to illustrate this approach aristotle proposed a first of its kind mathematical model of voting albeit textually described where the democratic principle of one voter one vote is combined with the oligarchic merit weighted voting for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see
aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages
in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade
his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbinss view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements
aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature
in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money
money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus
for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver
aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages
he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit
it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself
he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural
similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use
aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time
he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement
money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable
he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security
that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it
aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos pathos and logos
he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic forensic and deliberative
aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme and paradeigma
aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis each varying in imitation by medium object and manner
he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself
aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature
because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes
for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language
the forms also differ in their object of imitation
comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average
lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama
while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived
aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry
the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy
tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions
aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis
he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic
aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop
aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element
the biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well suited for reproduction which changes her body temperature which in turn makes her in aristotles view incapable of participating in political life
on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism
however aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men
more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived
he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields
according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did
among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method
taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long
as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones
evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind
jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought
aristotle has been called the father of logic biology political science zoology embryology natural law scientific method rhetoric psychology realism criticism individualism teleology and meteorology
aristotles pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants a pioneering work in botany
some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber
theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned
the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school
aristotles students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus
aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers
he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher
although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work
though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly
it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found
the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation
herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not
though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the th and th centuries
ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance
greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus
the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century
john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought
philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations
after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena
aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology
most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars
averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers
alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers
medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher
the title was later used by western philosophers who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy
with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from to except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke
after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance
these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages
scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic
the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him
phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that a womans charms could overcome even the greatest philosophers male intellect
artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme
besides dantes fellow poets the classical figure that most influenced the comedy is aristotle
dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking
dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of albert magnus
dante even acknowledges aristotles influence explicitly in the poem specifically when virgil justifies the infernos structure by citing the nicomachean ethics
moses maimonides adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy
maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived and styled him as the chief of the philosophers
also in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are sufficient by themselves and to all that were written before them
his intellect aristotles is the extreme limit of human intellect apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy there being no level higher
in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment
harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat as aristotle thought
galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight
the th century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle
aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people and the natural superiority of others
it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition
the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his book the laws of thought
this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two
charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology
in an letter he wrote that linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods though in very different ways but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle
also in later editions of the book on the origin of species darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle the text he cites is a summary by aristotle of the ideas of the earlier greek philosopher empedocles
james joyces favoured philosopher was aristotle whom he considered to be the greatest thinker of all times
samuel taylor coleridge said everybody is born either a platonist or an aristotelian
ayn rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three as aristotle aquinas and ayn rand
she also regarded aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers
karl marx considered aristotle to be the greatest thinker of antiquity and called him a giant thinker a genius and the great scholar
during the th century aristotles work was widely criticized
the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine
russell called aristotles ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy
russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors
the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceed so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses
in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility
by the start of the st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition
alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans
kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the film alexander while the firm rules of aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood
biologists continue to be interested in aristotles thinking
armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology while niko tinbergens four questions based on aristotles four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny
the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum
these texts as opposed to aristotles lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school
reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works
aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era
his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school
aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus
whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication
ciceros description of aristotles literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes
a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones now possessed came to be found
the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today
according to strabo and plutarch after aristotles death his library and writings went to theophrastus
after the death of theophrastus the peripatetic library went to neleus of scepsis
some time later the kingdom of pergamon began conscripting books for a royal library and the heirs of neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose
the library was stored there for about a century and a half in conditions that were not ideal for document preservation
on the death of attalus iii which also ended the royal library ambitions the existence of aristotelian library was disclosed and it was purchased by apellicon and returned to athens in about
apellicon sought to recover the texts many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored
he had them copied out into new manuscripts and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable
when sulla seized athens in he seized the library and transferred it to rome
there andronicus of rhodes organized the texts into the first complete edition of aristotles works
the aristotelian texts we have to day are based on these
aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries
among the best known depictions is raphaels fresco the school of athens in the vaticans apostolic palace where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image at the architectural vanishing point reflecting their importance
rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer too is a celebrated work showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones writes this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world ensnaring us in its musty glowing pitch black terrible knowledge of time
the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle
he was the first person known to conjecture in his book meteorology the existence of a landmass in the southern high latitude region and called it antarctica
aristoteles is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotles name
the secondary literature on aristotle is vast
the following is only a small selection
an american in paris is a jazz influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin first performed in
it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the
gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns
he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic
it was damrosch who had commissioned gershwin to write his concerto in f following the earlier success of rhapsody in blue
he completed the orchestration on november less than four weeks before the works premiere
he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor
although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study with ravel
after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be a second rate ravel when you can be a first rate gershwin gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour
to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel
gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march during a party held for ravels birthday by va gauthier
ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel
ravels high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris
yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him
boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could i give you that you havent already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w
yeats ernest hemingway f
scott fitzgerald and artist pablo picasso
gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer
gershwin called it a rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works
gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere
the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format
gershwins first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six
this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns
the b sections andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness
the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues
in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum
moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a
after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso
gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris
he stated that damroschs sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work
the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses
critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwins concerto in f
some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers csar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere
gershwin responded to the critics an american in paris was originally scored for flutes oboes english horn clarinets in b flat bass clarinet in b flat bassoons horns in f trumpets in b flat trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta taxi horns labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone and strings
although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it had been gershwins intention to use the notes a b d and a
it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played
a major revision of the work by composer and arranger f
campbell watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano and alto saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments
this became the standard performing edition until when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwins original manuscript including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watsons revision
gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian
william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in
on september it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released
the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent
it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process
the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released
the entire project was expected to take to years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series
two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher b note music in
the changes made by campbell watson were withdrawn in both editions
in the extended urtext bars of music were re integrated
conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance
on september the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan
this performance was of the original orchestration
an american in paris has been frequently recorded
the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra
gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio
then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording
this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat b flat a higher d and a lower a
the radio broadcast of the september hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in a two cd set
arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music
in arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in of gershwins original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today
the blues section of an american in paris has been recorded separately by a number of artists ralph flanagan his orchestra released it as a single in which reached no
on the billboard chart
harry james released a version of the blues section on his album one night stand recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago
in metro goldwyn mayer released the musical film an american in paris featuring gene kelly and leslie caron
winning the best picture oscar and numerous other awards the film was directed by vincente minnelli featured many tunes of gershwin and concluded with an extensive elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem costing
the academy award for best production design recognizes achievement for art direction in film
the categorys original name was best art direction but was changed to its current name in for the th academy awards
this change resulted from the art directors branch of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences being renamed the designers branch
since the award is shared with the set decorators
it is awarded to the best interior design in a film
the films below are listed with their production year
in the lists below the winner of the award for each year is shown first followed by the other nominees in alphabetical order
the academy awards also known as the oscars are awards for artistic and technical merit for the film industry
they are presented annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences in recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academys voting membership
the academy awards are regarded by many as the most prestigious significant awards in the entertainment industry in the united states and worldwide
the oscar statuette depicts a knight rendered in the art deco style
the major award categories are presented during a live televised hollywood ceremony that is typically held in february or march
it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony
the st academy awards were held in the second ceremony in was the first one broadcast by radio and the ceremony was the first one televised
it is also the oldest of the four major annual american entertainment awards its equivalents the emmy awards for television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music are modeled after the academy awards

the post awards party was held at the mayfair hotel
the cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was
fifteen statuettes were awarded honoring artists directors and other participants in the film making industry of the time for their works during the period
the ceremony ran for minutes
for this first ceremony winners were announced to the media three months earlier
for the second ceremony in and the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at pm on the night of the awards
in the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the following year the academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners
the term oscar is a registered trademark of the ampas however in the italian language it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony regardless of which field
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh
he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history
at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films
with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film
for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years
at the th ceremony held in the best foreign language film category now known as best international feature film was introduced
until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award
perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was year old robert opel who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing a peace sign on national us television at the th academy awards in
bemused host david niven quipped isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr robert metzler the shows business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be
the th academy awards held in presented the first academy award for best animated feature

the rd academy awards ceremony honoring the best films of and early was held on april after it was postponed from its original february schedule due to the impact of the covid pandemic on cinema
as with the two previous ceremonies there was no host
the ceremony was broadcast on abc
it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles california for the th consecutive year along with satellite location taking place at the union station also in los angeles
because of the virus impact on films and tv industries academy president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson announced that for the oscar ceremony streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return
the best known award is the academy award of merit more popularly known as the oscar statuette
made of gold plated bronze on a black metal base it is in tall weighs lb and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes
the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians
sculptor george stanley sculpted cedric gibbons design
the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze
within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally karat gold
due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years
following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones
the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base
the original oscar mold was cast in at the cw shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy award statuettes
from to approximately oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer rs owens company
it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture statuettes
in the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to walden new york based polich tallix fine art foundry now owned and operated by uap urban art projects
while based on a digital scan of an original oscar the statuettes retain their modern era dimensions and black pedestal
cast in liquid bronze from d printed ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in karat gold by brooklyn new york based epner technology
the time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months
rs owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating
the origin of the nickname of the trophy has been disputed as multiple people have taken credit for naming the trophy oscar
bette davis in her autobiography claimed she named it in after her first husband harmon oscar nelson of whom the statues rear end reminded her
but the term had been in use at least two years before and in a biography written by whitney stine with commentary from davis davis wrote i relinquish once and for all any claim that i was the one so academy of motion picture arts and sciences the honor is all yours
margaret herrick librarian and president of the academy may have said she named it after her supposed uncle oscar in
the only corroboration was a clipping from the los angeles examiner in which herrick told a story of her and her husband joking with each other using the phrase hows your uncle oscar
columnist sidney skolsky wrote in his memoir that he came up with the term in under pressure for a deadline mocking vaudeville comedians who asked will you have a cigar oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march which was written about that years th academy awards
but the newspaper clipping skolsky referred to he wrote that these statues are called oscars meaning that the name was already in use
bruce davis a former executive director of the academy credits eleanore lilleberg a secretary at the academy when the award was first introduced for the nickname as she had been in charge of pre ceremony handling of the awards
davis credits lilleberg because he found in an autobiography of einar lilleberg eleanores brother that einar had referenced a norwegian army veteran named oscar the two knew in chicago who einar described as having always stood straight and tall
he asserts credit should almost certainly belong to lilleberg
to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates
until winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars
since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription processing station at the governors ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony
the rs owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner
the nameplates for the non winning nominees are later recycled
prior to oscar statuettes were the property of the recipient
since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us
if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette
academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six figure sums
in michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his production of around the world in days to a movie prop collector
the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale
in harold russell consigned his oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses
though his decision caused controversy the first oscar ever to be sold passed to a private collector on august for
russell defended his action saying i dont know why anybody would be critical
my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons
the movie will be here even if oscar isnt
in december orson welles oscar for citizen kane was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy
on december it sold in an online auction for us
some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy which keeps them in its treasury
the academy also awards nicholl fellowships in screenwriting
from to the academy award nomination results were announced to the public in mid january
prior to that the results were announced in early february
in the nominees were announced in march
in the nominees were announced in early february for the first time since
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of over
academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production
actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering members of the academys composition
votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers since the th academy awards in
the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the academy in december to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in january of the next year then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees
membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures
new membership proposals are considered annually
the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join
the release also stated that it has just under voting members
while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then
in the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately of ampas voting membership
of the active voters confirmed were caucasian were male and were found to be over the age of
of voting members are former nominees and winners
in may the academy sent a letter advising its or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in
according to rules and of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january to midnight at the end of december in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify
additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between pm and pm local time
for example the best picture winner the hurt locker was originally first released in but did not qualify for the awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid thus qualifying for the awards
foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year
rule states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a mm or mm film print or in frame s or frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of by pixels
since the th academy awards presented in multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award
this followed the win of an eight hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in
the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film
the best international feature film award does not require a us release
it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection
the best documentary feature award requires either week long releases in both los angeles county and any of the five boroughs of new york city during the previous calendar year or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list or submission in the international feature film category as its countrys official selection
the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings
additionally a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times time out new york the los angeles times or la weekly
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year
the form includes the production credits for all related categories
then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases
awards in short film categories have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards
first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead covering one year starting on october st and ending on september th of the calendar year before the ceremony
second there are multiple methods of qualification
the main method is a week long theatrical release in either new york city or los angeles county during the eligibility period
films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy also without regard to prior public distribution
finally a film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible
the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards
only one screening per day is required
for the documentary award the screening must start between noon and pm local time for other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times
in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around active members
for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories
in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees
in all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ranked preferentially
in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches
in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members
since the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting
since re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects
film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season
the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified
it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders
for example a producer of the best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner
the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films in one place
it was introduced in for the oscars though dvd screeners and academy in person screenings were still provided
for films to be included on the platform the north american distributor must pay including a watermarking fee and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy
the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players
the watermarking process involved several video security firms creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings
in for the oscars the academy banned all physical screeners and in person screenings restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room
films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform
distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform
the in person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid pandemic
eligible films do not have to be added to the platform but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are
the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees
it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year
this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day
black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this
the academy awards is the worlds longest running awards show televised live from the us to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world
the oscars were first televised in by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until when abc took over televising the festivities through
nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in and its current contract with the academy runs through
the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets in more desirable local timeslots
the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast
by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in countries
a decade later the rights were already being sold to countries and by the tv rights to the awards were licensed in countries
the ceremonies were moved up from late march early april to late february since to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry
another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience
the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period
some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games
another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public
advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast
the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history with wins and nominations overall since that awards own launch in
after many years of being held on mondays at pm eastern pm pacific since the ceremonies it was moved to sundays at pm et pm pt
the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier
for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office
in the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season
however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers
furthermore a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games
in the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nd academy awards in
originally scheduled for april the th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march the rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington dc in an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members
this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names
criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead
this segment was later followed by a commercial break
in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours
the first oscars in lasted minutes
at the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes
in the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past seconds
this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion
in in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker
during the ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night while the show itself also faced mixed reception
following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself
currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions
in august ampas extended its contract with abc through the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast
historically the telecasts viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the best picture award
more than million viewers tuned to the telecast for the th academy awards in the year of titanic which generated a box office haul during its initial run of us million in the us a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years
the th academy awards ceremony in which received awards including best picture drew million viewers
the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the nd academy awards which drew a household rating on april
hoping to reinvigorate the pre show and ratings the oscars organizers hired members of the met gala creative team by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critical acclaim those films have received
the th academy awards which awarded low budget independent film crash generated an audience of million with a household rating of
in the th academy awards telecast was watched by million viewers on average with an household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the academy awards
the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film
whereas the nd academy awards drew an average of million viewers the rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of million the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in
the th and th editions drew and million viewers still below the audience of the nd edition
the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the oscars and material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows
copies are held in a variety of film video and digital formats
in the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel
from to the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles
graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from to
the st academy awards in were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood
from to the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre
with the advent of television the awards from to took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles
the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in
by the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center
in the late s and early s the ceremony returned to the shrine auditorium
in hollywoods dolby theatre became the presentations current venue
in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories
at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories
from the s through the s the art direction cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories
prior to the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup
in august the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony
following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all categories live
this followed several proposals that the academy had announced but did not implement
the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories
to date the following categories have been proposed the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole
they are not always presented on an annual basis
due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season
this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality
william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself
tim dirks editor of amcs filmsiteorg has written of the academy awards a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign
these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie
examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history
typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the us in the last three months of the calendar year
the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded
the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies
this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues
the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees
this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since which show that only of academy award nominees have been non white and since of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing
due to a variety of reasons including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples a number of high profile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters
it took until for an asian woman to win an academy award for best actress when michelle yeoh received the award for her performance in everything everywhere all at once
the th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on activists perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias
in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by
media critics find the academys efforts to address its racial gender and national biases are merely distractions especially since they continue to ignore asian performers
by contrast the golden globe awards already have multiple winners of asian descent in leading actress categories
some question whether the academys definition of merit is just or empowering for non americans
the academy doesnt have any rules for how to categorize whether a performance is leading or supporting and it is up to the discretion of the studios whether a given performance is submitted for either best actor actress or best supporting actor actress
this has led situations where a film has two or more co leads and one of these is submitted in a supporting category to avoid the two leads competing against each other and to increase the films chances of winning
this practice has been derisively called category fraud
for example rooney mara was nominated for best supporting actress for carol despite her having a comparable amount of screentime to cate blanchett who was nominated for best actress
another example is once upon a time in hollywood where brad pitt was nominated for and won best supporting actor even though he played an equally important role to best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio
in both these cases critics argued that the weinstein company the studio behind both films had placed someone who was actually a leading actor or actress into the supporting categories to avoid them competing against their co lead
acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work
following the st academy awards in february in which the netflix broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services
spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an oscar
the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the academy in march cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the academy
following its april board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs
during the th academy awards on march chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head with a gi jane reference
will smith walked onstage and slapped rock across the face then returned to his seat and told rock twice to keep my wifes name out your fucking mouth while later accepting the best actor award for king richard smith apologized to the academy and the other nominees but not to rock
rock decided not to press charges against smith
on april the academy made an announcement on a letter sent by president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson informing the public that will smith is banned from the oscars for years in result from the slap
some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars
the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols
nichols boycotted the th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild
nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony
nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career
george c
scott became the second person to refuse his award at the rd academy awards ceremony
scott described it as a meat parade saying i dont want any part of it
the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans
at the th academy awards ceremony brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a page speech in his place detailing his criticisms for which there was booing and cheering by the audience
littlefeather was much later discovered to have falsely misrepresented her ancestry as native american that is she was found to be a pretendian
it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars
in recent years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners
the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars
in the value was reported to be as high as us
the value has risen to the point where the us internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status
oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant videophones a four night stay at a hotel watches bracelets spa treatments bottles of vodka maple salad dressing weight loss gummie candy and up to worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from new york city facial plastic surgeon konstantin vasyukevich
some of the gifts have even had a risque element to them in the adult products retailer adam eve had a secret room gifting suite
celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag carolyn hennesy kate linder chris mulkey jim oheir and john salley
in an effort to revitalize the pre show and ratings the oscars organizers hired members of the met gala creative team
from onwards results are livesd all previous years are live viewing
the following nominees received at least nominations madhav sharma actresses is a catalan language spanish drama film produced and directed by ventura pons and based on the award winning stage play er by josep maria benet i jornet

actrius screened in at the graumans egyptian theatre in an american cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director
the film had first screened at the same location in
it was also shown at the stockholm international film festival
in movie film review christopher tookey wrote that though the actresses were competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers the film is visually unimaginative never escapes its stage origins and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident
noting that there were occasional refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness they did not justify comparisons to all about eve and were insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with rashomon
he also wrote that the guardian called the film a slow stuffy chamber piece and that the evening standard stated the films best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesomes composed veneers
mrqe wrote this cinematic adaptation of a theatrical work is true to the original but does not stray far from a theatrical rendering of the story

international atomic time is a high precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid
tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide
it is a continuous scale of time without leap seconds and it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time
it is the basis for coordinated universal time which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earths surface and which has leap seconds
utc deviates from tai by a number of whole seconds
when another leap second was put into effect utc is currently exactly seconds behind tai
the seconds result from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since
tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth
specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used
tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due primarily to the slowing rotation of the earth
tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories worldwide
the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units definition of the second is based on caesium
the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer
due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock
the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai
time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds
these time scales are denoted in the form utc in the utc form where npl here identifies the national physical laboratory uk
the tai form may be denoted tai
the latter is not to be confused with ta which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else
the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other
the international bureau of weights and measures combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible
this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical tai
this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc for each participating institution k
the same circular also gives tables of tai ta for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales
errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t
aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised
in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale
since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time
early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk
it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale called greenwich atomic
the united states naval observatory began the a scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october
the international time bureau began a time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals
the bih scale a and nbs a were defined by an epoch at the beginning of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a in and ta in
the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in
from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions that designated the bipm time scale international atomic time
in the s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks
starting from the julian date corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid
because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion
the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal
the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time geocentric coordinate time and terrestrial time which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system
all three of these time scales were defined to read jd exactly at that instant
tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai s
the continued existence of tai was questioned in a letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc
contrary to tai utc is a discontinuous time scale
it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds
between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time by a constant offset
from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut
afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut
this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale
the less frequent whole second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally
the fact that it continues to approximate ut means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc
altruism is the principle and practice of concern for the welfare and or happiness of other humans or animals
it is an important moral value in many religions
the objects of altruistic concern vary among cultures and religions
at one extreme altruism may become a synonym of selflessness the opposite of selfishness
the word altruism was popularized by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as for an antonym of egoism
he derived it from the italian which in turn was derived from latin meaning other people or somebody else
altruism as observed in populations of organisms is when an individual performs an action at a cost to themselves that benefits directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action
altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good
the latter are predicated upon social relationships whilst altruism does not consider relationships
whether true altruism is possible in human psychology is a subject of debate
the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification
the validity of this argument depends on whether such qualify as benefits
the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others
used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first
effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
the concept of altruism has a history in philosophical and ethical thought
the term was coined in the th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists evolutionary biologists and ethologists
whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism
in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them
marcel mausss essay the gift contains a passage called note on alms
this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms from the notion of sacrifice
in it he writes in the science of ethology and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor
in evolutionary psychology this term may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism
theories of apparently altruistic behavior were by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins
two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies
such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts
instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote certain altruistic behaviors
the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups
research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members in groups than to members of out groups
the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r
prices development of the price equation a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution
an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides
these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body
selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success
such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics for example by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his book and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left
jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs dor hospital network provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging
in their research they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex
however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region
these structures social attachment and bonding in other species
altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable
one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex basal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with empathy
the same study showed giving to charity and of social bonding
bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist in an fmri scanner test conducted with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions as jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists
one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in charity such as a persons environment and values
the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare
psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare
there has been some debate on whether humans are capable of psychological altruism
some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors
however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases selflessness of altruistic acts is difficult to prove
the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self
daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argued against the social exchange theory
he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self to ultimately benefit the other person to benefit a group or to uphold a moral principle
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless
the empathy altruism hypothesis states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering
feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need
empathy is thus not selfless since altruism works either as a way to avoid those negative unpleasant feelings and have positive pleasant feelings when triggered by others need for help or as a way to gain social reward or avoid social punishment by helping
people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering
helping behavior is seen in humans from about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues
in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service
people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress
the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping
greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility
however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders
many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well being
in a study of older adults those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live and less depression anxiety and somatization
volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages
one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a year period and found that of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one
a study on adults aged and older found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a lower likelihood of dying
after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a reduction in mortality
merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being
a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness
while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder
the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional
studies found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states
feeling over taxed by the needs of others has negative effects on health and happiness
for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one
pathological altruism is altruism taken to an unhealthy extreme such that it either harms the altruistic person or the persons well intentioned actions cause more harm than good
the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism
examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid
sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society
the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a commonly researched topic within the field
the american sociology association acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable
this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid popular and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies
how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society
the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study for example one study links the occurrence of moral outrage to altruistic compensation of victims
studies show that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate the generosity they observe in others
most if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value
buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc
place particular emphasis on altruistic morality
altruism figures prominently in buddhism
love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering
many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion
these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being
the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes the practitioners own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes
in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect
a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness
the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings
jainism preaches to live and let live not harming sentient beings ie uncompromising reverence for all life
it also considers all living things to be equal
the first rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things
the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul
jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become
because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in ones actions
jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small
this policy extends even to microscopic organisms
jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders
thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others
considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship he quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves
aquinas concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part
however he thought we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being
in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism
the aim and focus of christian life is a life that glorifies god with obeying christs command to treat others equally caring for them and understanding eternity in heaven is what jesus resurrection at calvary was all about
many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god
states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god
thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love
an altruistic action is not always a loving action
oord defines altruism as acting for the others good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall well being
german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak
one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence
another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love
nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business
at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc
directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse
in islam means preferring others to oneself
for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by allah on the human body considered to be property of allah alone
the importance of lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing as abiding by the highest degree of nobility
this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in
a constant concern for allah results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world
judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation
rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity
love is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism
this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god
kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence
rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this force of giving
modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework
ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another
ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity
altruism is essential to the sikh religion
the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed anyone can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony and truthfulness
or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism
the fifth guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth
the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity
in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy
he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield
some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy
sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield
what were you doing and why asked the guru
i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya
the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds
you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru
under the tutelage of the guru bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service
in hinduism selflessness love kindness and forgiveness are considered as the highest acts of humanity or
giving alms to the beggars or poor people is considered as a divine act or and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or and will led them to heaven or in afterlife
altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs
mass donation of clothes to poor people or blood donation camp or mass food donation for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies
the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga nishkam karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism
altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and are central to hindu morality
there is a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically
proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically
the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest
both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants
a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible
rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones self interest
effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values
it is the broad evidence based and cause neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity
effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence based practices
while a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or otherwise have the biggest benefit
people associated with the movement include philosopher peter singer facebook co founder dustin moskovitz cari tuna oxford based researchers william macaskill and toby ord and professional poker player liv boeree
oxtr cd comt drd drd igf and gabrb are candidate genes for influencing altruistic behavior
digital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of reciprocity and in the belief that in the end everyone benefits from sharing information via the internet
there are three types of digital altruism everyday digital altruism involving expedience ease moral engagement and conformity creative digital altruism involving creativity heightened moral engagement and cooperation and co creative digital altruism involving creativity moral engagement and meta cooperative efforts
alice oconnor better known by her pen name ayn rand was a russian born american writer and philosopher
she is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named objectivism
born and educated in russia she moved to the united states in
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two broadway plays she achieved fame with her novel the fountainhead
in rand published her best selling work the novel atlas shrugged
afterward until her death in she turned to non fiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays
rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge she rejected faith and religion
she supported rational and ethical egoism as opposed to altruism
in politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism statism and anarchism
instead she supported laissez faire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights including private property rights
although rand opposed libertarianism which she viewed as anarchism she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the united states
in art rand promoted romantic realism
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals
rands books have sold over million copies
her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics with reviews becoming more negative for her later work
although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy arguing that she has a polemical approach and that her work lacks methodological rigor
her writings have politically influenced some right libertarians and conservatives
the objectivist movement circulates her ideas both to the public and in academic settings
rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february to a russian jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg
she was the eldest of three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum a pharmacist and anna borisovna
she was twelve when the october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously
her fathers pharmacy was nationalized and the family fled to the city of yevpatoria in crimea which was initially under the control of the white army during the russian civil war
after graduating high school there in june she returned with her family to petrograd where they faced desperate conditions occasionally nearly starving
when russian universities were opened to women after the revolution rand was among the first to enroll at petrograd state university
at she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history
along with many other bourgeois students she was purged from the university shortly before graduating
after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were reinstated in the university
rand was among these reinstated students and she completed her studies at the renamed leningrad state university in october
she then studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad
for an assignment rand wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri it became her first published work
by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand and she adopted the first name ayn
in late rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in chicago
she departed on january and arrived in new york city on february
intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with her relatives learning english before leaving for hollywood california
in hollywood a chance meeting with famed director cecil b
demille led to work as an extra in his film the king of kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter
while working on the king of kings she met an aspiring young actor frank oconnor the two married on april
she became a permanent american resident in july and an american citizen on march
she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate
rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in although it was never produced
her courtroom drama night of january th first staged in hollywood in reopened successfully on broadway in
each night a jury was selected from members of the audience based on its vote one of two different endings would be performed
rand and oconnor moved to new york city in december so she could handle revisions for the broadway production
her first novel the semi autobiographical we the living was published in
set in soviet russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state
initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell
she adapted the story as a stage play but the broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week
after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in that has since sold over three million copies
rand started her next major novel the fountainhead in december but took a break from it in to write her novella anthem
the novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we
it was published in england in but rand could not find an american publisher at that time
as with we the living rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in and this sold over million copies
during the s rand became politically active
she and her husband were full time volunteers for republican wendell willkies presidential campaign
this work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free market capitalism
she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt who introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises
despite philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and they expressed admiration for her
mises once referred to her as the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman
rand became friends with libertarian writer isabel paterson
rand questioned her about american history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only non fiction book the god of the machine
rands first major success as a writer came in with the fountainhead a novel about an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as second handers those who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves
twelve publishers rejected it before bobbs merrill company accepted it at the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it
while completing the novel rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue
the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest
her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to mood swings and outbursts described by some of her later associates
the success of the fountainhead brought rand fame and financial security
in she sold the film rights to warner bros
and returned to hollywood to write the screenplay
producer hal b
wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and script doctor
her work for him included the screenplays for love letters and you came along
her contract with wallis also allowed time for other projects including a never completed nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism
while working in hollywood rand became involved with the anti communist motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals and wrote articles on the groups behalf
she also joined the anti communist american writers association
in during the second red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the united states house un american activities committee that the film song of russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as much better and happier than it was
she also wanted to criticize the lauded film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so
when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations effectiveness rand described the process as futile
after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in
although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing the acting and other elements
following the publication of the fountainhead rand received many letters from readers some of whom the book had influenced profoundly
in rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the federal reserve alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal and his wife barbara and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff
initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy
later rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged
in her close relationship with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the knowledge of their spouses
published in atlas shrugged is considered rands magnum opus
she described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest
it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement
the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy
the novels hero and leader of the strike john galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements
the novel contains an exposition of objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by galt
despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed rand
atlas shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher
in nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute to promote rands philosophy through public lectures
he and rand co founded the objectivist newsletter in to circulate articles about her ideas she later republished some of these articles in book form
rand was unimpressed by many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her
critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later described the culture of the nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand
some described the nbi or the objectivist movement as a cult or religion
rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair
some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers
some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new york
throughout the s and s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities
she began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum responding to questions from the audience
during these appearances she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day
these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft supporting israel in the yom kippur war of against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages claiming european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting despite advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it
she endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter
in nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married
nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand
when she learned of it in though her romantic involvement with branden was already over rand ended her relationship with both brandens and the nbi was closed
she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life
in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company
rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking
in she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare
during the late s her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november
one of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged
on march rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city
at her funeral a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket
in her will rand named peikoff as her heir
rand described her approach to literature as romantic realism
she wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was
this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters
her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive
her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals
rand often describes them as unattractive and some have names that suggest negative traits such as wesley mouch in atlas shrugged
rand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer anne heller described as tight elaborate fast paced plotting
romantic triangles are a common plot element in rands fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two men
in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her favorites
she considered them to be among the top rank of romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots
hugo was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting
in the introduction she wrote for an english language edition of his novel ninety three rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature
although rand disliked most russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and other nineteenth century russian writing most notably the novel what is to be done by nikolay chernyshevsky
rands experience of the russian revolution and early communist russia influenced the portrayal of her villains
beyond we the living which is set in russia this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of ellsworth toohey in the fountainhead and in the destruction of the economy in atlas shrugged
rands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios
they often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close up details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective
rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute
she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics aesthetics epistemology ethics and political philosophy
in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion
rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism
in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value judgments
according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness
as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature
she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will
in epistemology rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses
rand rejected all claims of non perceptual knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing
in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy
she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy
commentators including hazel barnes nathaniel branden and albert ellis have criticized rands focus on the importance of reason
barnes and ellis said rand was too dismissive of emotion and failed to recognize its importance in human life
branden said rands emphasis on reason led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be
in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism as the guiding moral principle
she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself
rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title
in it she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man
she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites
rands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy
several authors including robert nozick and william f
oneill in two of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the is ought problem
critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage
critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism
rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights
she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights
rand opposed collectivism and statism which she considered to include many specific forms of government such as communism fascism socialism theocracy and the welfare state
her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights
although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian rand preferred the term radical for capitalism
she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics
rand denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism
she rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice
several critics including nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails
others like libertarian philosopher michael huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions
some critics like roy childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government
except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her
acknowledging aristotle as her greatest influence rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three as aristotle aquinas and ayn rand
in a interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me
in an article for the claremont review of books political scientist charles murray criticized rands claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle
he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche
rand took early inspiration from nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in rands private journals
in she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer william edward hickman
there are other indications of nietzsches influence in passages from the first edition of we the living and in her overall writing style
by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsches ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed
rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankinds history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self interest
philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences
she was also critical of plato and viewed his differences with aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy
rands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic
she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse
she was dismissive of critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in depth analysis
she was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration
the first reviews rand received were for night of january th
reviews of the broadway production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer
although rand believed that her novel we the living was not widely reviewed over publications published approximately different reviews
overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work
her novella anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues
rands first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed
lorine pruettes positive review in the new york times which called the author a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly was one that rand greatly appreciated
there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications
some negative reviews said the novel was too long others called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian
atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative
atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity
whittaker chambers wrote what was later called the novels most notorious review for the conservative magazine national review
he accused rand of supporting a godless system claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard
commanding to a gas chamber go
rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels
the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged
philosopher sidney hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality
these reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics
her subsequent books got progressively less review attention
with over million copies sold rands books continue to be read widely
a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book of the month club in asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives
rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible
although rands influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work
rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like ira levin kay nolte smith and l
neil smith she has influenced later writers like erika holzer terry goodkind and comic book artist steve ditko
rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work
businessmen such as john allison of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands ideas
television shows movies songs and video games have referred to rand and her works
throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines as well as book length critiques by authors such as the psychologist albert ellis and trinity foundation president john w
rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by american authors including kay nolte smith mary gaitskill matt ruff and tobias wolff
nick gillespie former editor in chief of reason remarked that rands is a tortured immortality one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist
jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture
two movies have been made about rands life
a documentary film was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature
the passion of ayn rand a television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards
rands image also appears on a us postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano
rands works most commonly anthem or the fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading
since the ayn rand institute has provided free copies of rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum
the institute had distributed million copies in the us and canada by the end of
in rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom
although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had a continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism
rand is often considered one of the three most important women in the early development of modern american libertarianism
david nolan one founder of the libertarian party said that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist
in his history of that movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large
political scientist andrew koppelman called her the most widely read libertarian
historian jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right
the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives despite rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being pro choice and an atheist
she faced intense opposition from william f
buckley jr and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas
nevertheless a article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administrations novelist laureate
republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels
she has influenced some conservative politicians outside the us such as sajid javid in the united kingdom siv jensen in norway and ayelet shaked in israel
the financial crisis of spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis
opinion articles compared real world events with the novels plot
signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests
there was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left
critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan
in adam weiner said that through greenspan rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy
lisa duggan said that rands novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas
in cass sunstein said rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of rands fiction
during rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars
since her death interest in her work has increased gradually
in historian jennifer burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since
as of that year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study
from to over colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of bbt corporation that required teaching rands ideas or works in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about rand
in media critic eric burns said that rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher
that same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years
in john hospers discussed rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook an introduction to philosophical analysis
that same year hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics
when the first full length academic book about rands philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously
a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in the personalist
one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who criticized her meta ethical arguments
other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that nozick misstated rands case
in an article responding to nozick douglas den uyl and douglas b
rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional
the philosophic thought of ayn rand a collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen was the first academic book about rands ideas published after her death
in one essay political writer jack wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought
in the ayn rand society was founded as an affiliate of the american philosophical association
in a entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers jenny a
heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand
she said that rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy
yet throughout literary academia ayn rand is considered a philosopher
writing in the edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts
he said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of aristotles ethics and her political theory is of little interest because it is marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism
the journal of ayn rand studies a multidisciplinary peer reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas was established in
in a essay for the cato institute huemer argued very few people find rands ideas convincing especially her ethics
he attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that atlas shrugged outsells rands non fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism
in the pennsylvania state university press agreed to take over publication of the journal of ayn rand studies and the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the societys proceedings
the fall update to the entry about rand in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously
that same year political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as the traditional academic view of rand
philosopher skye c
cleary wrote in a article for aeon that philosophers love to hate ayn rand
its trendy to scoff at any mention of her
however cleary said that because many people take rands ideas seriously philosophers need to treat the ayn rand phenomenon seriously and provide refutations rather than ignoring her
academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy
mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the s
since her death scholars of english and american literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the s
several academic book series about important authors cover rand and her works as do popular study guides like cliffsnotes and sparknotes
in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation
in duggan described rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers despite being easy to criticize for her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots her rigid moralizing her middle to lowbrow aesthetic preferences
and philosophical strivings
after the closure of the nathaniel branden institute the objectivist movement continued in other forms
in the s peikoff began delivering courses on objectivism
in peter schwartz started a newsletter called the intellectual activist which rand endorsed
she also endorsed the objectivist forum a bimonthly magazine founded by objectivist philosopher harry binswanger which ran from to
in peikoff worked with businessman ed snider to establish the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works
in after an ideological disagreement with peikoff david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society
in historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia

print e book algeria officially the peoples democratic republic of algeria is a country in north africa
algeria is bordered to the northeast by tunisia to the east by libya to the southeast by niger to the southwest by mali mauritania and western sahara to the west by morocco and to the north by the mediterranean sea
it is considered part of the maghreb region of north africa
it has a semi arid geography with most of the population living in the fertile north and the sahara dominating the geography of the south
algeria covers an area of making it the worlds tenth largest nation by area and the largest nation in africa more than times as large as the continents smallest country the gambia
with a population of million algeria is the tenth most populous country in africa and the nd most populous country in the world
the capital and largest city is algiers located in the far north on the mediterranean coast
algeria produced and is linked to many civilizations empires and dynasties including numidians mauretanians phoenicians carthaginians romans vandals mauro romans byzantines umayyads ifranids abbasids rustamids idrisids sulaymanids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads marinids hafsids and the zayyanids
centuries of arab migration to the maghreb since the th century shifted the demographic scope in algeria
the spanish expansionism led to the establishment of ottoman algeria in a state that attracted people from all over the mediterranean making its capital algiers one of the largest wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities in the world
its decline in the th century resulted in its invasion by the french in
the conquest and pacification of the country that ensued lasted until and led to algeria becoming an integral part of france in and home to over a million european settlers
the stif and guelma massacre in marked a turning point in franco algerian relations and sparked the algerian war which concluded with algeria gaining its independence on july and the proclamation of the peoples democratic republic on september of that year
the official languages of algeria are arabic and berber
the majority of algerias population is arab practicing islam
the native algerian arabic is the main spoken language
french also serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts but it has no official status
algeria is a semi presidential republic with local constituencies consisting of provinces and communes
algeria is a regional power in north africa and a middle power in global affairs
it has the highest human development index of all continental african countries and one of the largest economies on the continent based largely on energy exports
algeria has the worlds sixteenth largest oil reserves and the ninth largest reserves of natural gas
sonatrach the national oil company is the largest company in africa supplying large amounts of natural gas to europe
algerias military is one of the largest in africa and has the largest defence budget on the continent
it is a member of the african union the arab league the oic opec the united nations and the arab maghreb union of which it is a founding member
other forms of the name are berber languages
it is officially the peoples democratic republic of algeria
algerias name derives from the city of algiers which in turn derives from the arabic in reference to four small islands off its coast a truncated form of the older
the name was given by buluggin ibn ziri after he established the city on the ruins of the phoenician city of icosium in
it was employed by medieval geographers such as muhammad al idrisi and yaqut al hamawi
the ottoman empire extended the name of al jazir over the entire country deriving it from the name of the capital city
thus it shares its etymology with numerous other places such as alzira in valencia algeciras in andalusia lezria in portugal cizre in turkey gira in malta the nile island of gezira in egypt and the state of gezira in sudan
around million year old stone artifacts from ain hanech were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa
stone artifacts and cut marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be million years old and even older stone artifacts to be as old as million years
hence the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought
the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multiple origin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa
neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles similar to those in the levant
algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques
tools of this era starting about bc are called aterian
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian
this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between and bc
neolithic civilization developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as bc or as late as between and bc
this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period
the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa
from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius and rusicade
these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages
as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically
berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states
trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others
by the early th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army
in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from to bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war
they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa
the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars
in bc the city of carthage was destroyed
as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew
by the nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged
two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage
west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean
the high point of berber civilisation unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the nd century bc
after masinissas death in bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times
masinissas line survived until ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region algeria is the second country in the world after italy home to the largest number of roman sites and remains among the most alive and well preserved
rome after getting rid of its powerful rival carthage in the year bc decided a century later to include numidia to become the new master of north africa
they built more than cities
like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products
saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius located in the roman province of africa
the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in and by controlled coastal numidia
they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes
in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival
furthermore during the rule of the romans byzantines vandals carthaginians and ottomans the berber people were the only or one of the few in north africa who remained independent
the berber people were so resistant that even during the muslim conquest of north africa they still had control and possession over their mountains
the collapse of the western roman empire led to the establishment of a native kingdom based in altava known as the mauro roman kingdom
it was succeeded by another kingdom based in altava the kingdom of altava
during the reign of kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern day fez in the west to the western aurs and later kairaouan and the interior of ifriqiya in the east
after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early th century
large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam
christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the th century and muslims only became a vast majority some time in the th
after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the zayyanids
the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the th century and the th
the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the th century
during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mumin and yghmrasen
it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb
these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo
the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded
in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them
the resultant war is recounted in the epic tghribt
in al tghrbt the amazigh zirid hero khlf al znat asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero bu zayd al hilal and many other arab knights in a string of victories
the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture
the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it
the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen
caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era
the berber people historically consisted of several tribes
the two main branches were the botr and barns tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes
each region of the maghreb contained several tribes
all these tribes made independent territorial decisions
several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands
ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid ifranid maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties
both of the hammadid and zirid empires as well as the fatimids established their rule in all of the maghreb countries
the zirids ruled land in what is now algeria tunisia morocco libya spain malta and italy
the hammadids captured and held important regions such as ouargla constantine sfax susa algiers tripoli and fez establishing their rule in every country in the maghreb region
the fatimids which was created and established by the kutama berbers conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east
following the berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the maghreb
in algeria the rustamid kingdom was established
the rustamid realm stretched from tafilalt in morocco to the nafusa mountains in libya including south central and western tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day maghreb countries in the south the rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of mali and included territory in mauritania
once extending their control over all of the maghreb part of spain and briefly over sicily originating from modern algeria the zirids only controlled modern ifriqiya by the th century
the zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of the fatimid caliphs of cairo
el muizz the zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence
the zirids also fought against other zenata kingdoms for example the maghrawa a berber dynasty originating from algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the maghreb ruling over much of morocco and western algeria including fez sijilmasa aghmat oujda most of the sous and draa and reaching as far as msila and the zab in algeria
as the fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion they found another means of revenge
between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin nomad tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulency
the banu hilal and the banu sulaym for example who regularly disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot their farms
the then fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he could not control and broke a deal with the chiefs of these beduouin tribes
the fatimids even gave them money to leave
whole tribes set off with women children elders animals and camping equipment
some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region arriving
the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the battlefield
the arabs usually did not take control over the cities instead looting them and destroying them
the invasion kept going and in the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they encircled the qalaa of banu hammad as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago
from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains
some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the almohads in the second half of the th century
the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant
ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert
the almohads originating from modern day morocco although founded by a man originating from algeria known as abd al mumin would soon take control over the maghreb
during the time of the almohad dynasty abd al mumins tribe the kouma were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire
defeating the weakening almoravid empire and taking control over morocco in they pushed into algeria in taking control over tlemcen oran and algiers wrestling control from the hilian arabs and by the same year they defeated hammadids who controlled eastern algeria
following their decisive defeat in the battle of las navas de tolosa in the almohads began collapsing and in the governor of modern day western algeria yaghmurasen ibn zyan declared his independence and established the kingdom of tlemcen and the zayyanid dynasty
warring with the almohad forces attempting to restore control over algeria for years they defeated the almohads in after killing their caliph in a successful ambush near oujda
the zayyanids retained their control over algeria for centuries
much of the eastern territories of algeria were under the authority of the hafsid dynasty although the emirate of bejaia encompassing the algerian territories of the hafsids would occasionally be independent from central tunisian control
at their peak the zayyanid kingdom included all of morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as tunis which they captured during the reign of abu tashfin
after several conflicts with local barbary pirates sponsored by the zayyanid sultans spain decided to invade algeria and defeat the native kingdom of tlemcen
in they invaded and captured mers el kbir and in after a bloody siege they conquered oran
following their decisive victories over the algerians in the western coastal areas of algeria the spanish decided to get bolder and invaded more algerian cities
in they led a series of sieges and attacks taking over bejaia in a large siege and leading a semi successful siege against algiers
they also besieged tlemcen
in they took control over cherchell and jijel and attacked mostaganem where although they were not able to conquer the city they were able to force a tribute on them
in the ottoman privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers
they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim al tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions
when aruj was killed in during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers
the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some janissaries
with the aid of this force and native algerians hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran
the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan who assumed the position in
he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins as his mother was an algerian mooresse
until beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits
subsequently with the institution of a regular administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms
the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha
discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha
as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in
plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa
algiers lost between and inhabitants to the plague in and had high fatalities in and
the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea
the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves
they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives
according to robert davis from the th to th century pirates captured million to million europeans as slaves
they often made raids on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire
in for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population
in the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo
barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands
the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera
the introduction of broad sail ships from the beginning of the th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic
in july two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves
two weeks earlier another pirate ship from sal in morocco had also raided in iceland
some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria
in pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands
in the taifa of raises or the company of corsair captains rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power
the new leader received the title of dey
after the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty nobles
it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the th century it had become the deys instrument
in the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role
although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire in reality they acted independently from the rest of the empire and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis
the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat
the dey was elected for a life term but in the years that the system was in place fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated
despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly
although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest
autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylia although in the regency was able to take control over the kingdom of kuku in western kabylia
many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control while the deeper parts of the sahara were completely independent from algiers
barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in and
for the attack in the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta
over cannonballs were fired much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk
in algiers took back oran and mers el kbir the two last spanish strongholds in algeria
in the same year they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda which they then abandoned in
in the th century algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a license tax in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels
attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars which ended the attacks on us ships in
a year later a combined anglo dutch fleet under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen
these efforts proved successful although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in
under the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in
historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by the french conquest was complete
the war had killed approximately indigenous algerians since
french losses from to were dead in the hospital and only killed in action
the population of algeria which stood at about million in reached nearly million in
french policy was predicated on civilising the country
the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest
the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed
a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from to
on september napoleon iii declared our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million arabs whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination
during this time only kabylia resisted the kabylians were not colonized until after the mokrani revolt in
alexis de tocqueville wrote and never completed an unpublished essay outlining his ideas for how to transform algeria from an occupied tributary state to a colonial regime wherein he advocated for a mixed system of total domination and total colonization whereby french military would wage total war against civilian populations while a colonial administration would provide rule of law and property rights to settlers within french occupied cities
from until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and dpartement of the nation
one of frances longest held overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied noirs
between and french people emigrated to algeria
these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land
many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities
during the late th and early th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population
the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after
the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonized countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human capital intensive agriculture
during the second world war algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch which saw the first large scale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign
gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france
in may the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the stif and guelma massacre
tensions between the two population groups came to a head in when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of november
historians have estimated that between and harkis and their dependents were killed by the national liberation front or by lynch mobs in algeria
the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals
in addition the french destroyed over villages and relocated over million algerians to concentration camps
the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries
historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence

he began working while still in school to show that he could have been successful without the aid of his familys wealth
later francisco bankrupts the danconia business to put it out of others reach
his full name is given as francisco domingo carlos andres sebastin danconia
john galt is the primary male hero of atlas shrugged
he initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for taggart transcontinental who often dines with eddie willers in the employees cafeteria and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental
only eddies side of their conversations is given in the novel
later in the novel the reader discovers this workers true identity
before working for taggart transcontinental galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity but abandoned his prototype and his employment when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment
this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden
galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel working a job and living by himself where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership
he delivers a lengthy broadcast speech that presents the authors philosophy of objectivism
henry rearden is one of the central characters in atlas shrugged
he owns the most important steel company in the united states and invents rearden metal an alloy stronger lighter cheaper and tougher than steel
he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian his brother philip and his elderly mother
rearden represents a type of self made man and eventually divorces lillian abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government planted workers and joins john galts strike
edwin eddie willers is the special assistant to the vice president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental
his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts and himself likewise
he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental
willers does not possess the creative ability of galts associates but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations
after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt willers maintains the railroad until its collapse
one of galts first followers and world famous as a pirate who seizes relief ships sent from the united states to the peoples states of europe
he works to ensure that once those espousing galts philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society they have enough capital to rebuild the world
kept in the background for much of the book danneskjld makes a personal appearance to encourage rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years
danneskjld is married to the actress kay ludlow their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world which only knows of ludlow as a retired film star
considered a misfit by galts other adherents he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galts perspective
according to barbara branden who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written there were sections written describing danneskjlds adventures at sea cut from the final published text
in a comment at a lecture rand said that danneskjlds name was a tribute to victor hugos novel wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskjld
in the published book danneskjld is always seen through the eyes of others except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter
the president of taggart transcontinental and the books most important antagonist
taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own
he relies on his sister dagny taggart to actually run the railroad but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti capitalist moral and political beliefs
in a sense he is the antithesis of dagny
this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends and the horror that he will succeed at this
in the final chapters of the novel he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect
the unsupportive wife of hank rearden who dislikes his habits and seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value
lillian achieves this when she passes information to james taggart about her husbands affair with his sister
this information is used to blackmail rearden to sign a gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to others
lillian thereafter uses james taggart for sexual satisfaction until hank abandons her
ferris is a biologist who works as co ordinator at the state science institute
he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement and publishes a book entitled why do you think you think he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal
he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan
ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon and is the creator of the ferris persuader a torture machine
when john galt is captured by the looters ferris uses the device on galt but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt
ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters
a former professor at patrick henry university and along with colleague hugh akston mentor to francisco danconia john galt and ragnar danneskjld
he has since become a sell out one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval to the detriment of the free
he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military including a sound based weapon known as project x
he is killed when cuffy meigs drunkenly overloads the circuits of project x causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a mile radius
the character was in part modeled on j
robert oppenheimer whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons
to his former student galt stadler represents the epitome of human evil as the man who knew better but chose not to act for the good
the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty
in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources
later in the novel he becomes its top co ordinator a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country
mouchs mantra whenever a problem arises from his prior policy is to say i cant help it
i need wider powers
the following secondary characters also appear in the novel
anthropology is the scientific study of humanity concerned with human behavior human biology cultures societies and linguistics in both the present and past including past human species
social anthropology studies patterns of behavior while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values
a portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today
linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life
biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans
archaeological anthropology often termed as anthropology of the past studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence
it is considered a branch of anthropology in north america and asia while in europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history and palaeontology
the abstract noun is first attested in reference to history
its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann
their neo latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words nthrpos and lgos
its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle
it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early th century
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by tienne serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de brau
various short lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed
the socit ethnologique de paris the first to use the term ethnology was formed in
its members were primarily anti slavery activists
when slavery was abolished in france in the socit was abandoned
meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in a break away group of the aborigines protection society
these anthropologists of the times were liberal anti slavery and pro human rights activists
they maintained international connections
anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier th century
theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making feature by feature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then
for them the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect
darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late s
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences
paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the socit de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the socit danthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in
when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism
his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature
broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech
he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech
he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called brocas area after him
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six volume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvlker
the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples
the last two volumes were published posthumously
waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man
following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him
he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation
the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison
it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men
waitz was influential among british ethnologists
in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology
it was the nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence
representatives from the french socit were present though not broca
in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard
among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist
previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist
similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the italian society of anthropology and ethnology and many others subsequently
the majority of these were evolutionists
one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists
not religious himself he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation
during the last three decades of the th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association
the major theorists belonged to these organizations
they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning
by educational institutions in countries had some curriculum in anthropology
none of the faculty members were under a department named anthropology
this meager statistic expanded in the th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions many thousands in number
anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more
practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene
the organization has reached a global level
for example the world council of anthropological associations a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations
since the work of franz boas and bronisaw malinowski in the late th and early th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross cultural comparisons long term in depth examination of context and the importance they place on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research
cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques
this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against th century racial ideology through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of post colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism
ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork
in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate
in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeological anthropology plus linguistic anthropology
these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques
european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology
it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc
early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by al biruni of the islamic golden age
as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies
according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies
during the s and s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline
during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology
in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist
due to this difference in epistemology the four sub fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups
cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history
in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations
there is no hard and fast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree
inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values
accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross cultural comparison
this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research ie an ethnographic monograph
as a methodology ethnography is based upon long term fieldwork within a community or other research site
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology
ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures
the process of participant observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic point of view
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal
sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language
comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized west
the standard cross cultural sample includes such cultures
biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non human primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions
it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation
archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains
artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies
archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways
linguistic anthropology seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and non verbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis
ethnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction
it often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions
ethnography views first hand experience and social context as important
tim ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience applicable in general and novel settings while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity
he argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most non western contexts
to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities
boas primitive art claude lvi strauss the way of the masks or geertzs art as cultural system are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics
media anthropology emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media
other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early s
ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire
ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields such as teaching politics cultural anthropology etc
while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the th and th centuries it was formally termed ethnomusicology by dutch scholar jaap kunst
later the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology
visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid s new media
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media
visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphs paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology
economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical
its origins as a sub field of anthropology begin with the polish british founder of anthropology bronisaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of gift giving exchange as an alternative to market exchange
economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange
the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast
economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective
political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to non capitalist societies
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture
three main areas of interest rapidly developed
the first of these areas was concerned with the pre capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes
sahlins work on hunter gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam
the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist world system
more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial capitalism around the world
applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems
it is a complex of related research based instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action and or the formulation of policy
applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community
it is closely related to development anthropology
anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves
over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship
broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent and also relatives by marriage
within kinship you have two different families
people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with
this is called consanguineal relations or blood ties people can also have a chosen family in which they chose who they want to be a part of their family
in some cases people are closer with their chosen family more than with their biological families
feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge
anthropology engages often with feminists from non western traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of europe america and elsewhere
from the perspective of the western world historically such peripheral perspectives have been ignored observed only from an outsider perspective and regarded as less valid or less important than knowledge from the western world
exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology
feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the patriarchal origins of anthropology and note that from to doctorates in anthropology went to males more than more than were under and only to anyone over years old thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first wave feminists until later in life
this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory history linguistics archaeology and anthropology
feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies
gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexism
according to st
clair drake vera mae green was until ell into the s the only african american female anthropologist who was also a caribbeanist
she studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied
however zora neale hurston although often primarily considered to be a literary author was trained in anthropology by franz boas and published tell my horse about her anthropological observations of voodoo in the caribbean
feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies
medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation
it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology
currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole
it focuses on the following six basic fields other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness
on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization
nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development for any given group of people
psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group with its own history language practices and conceptual categories shape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health
it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms
cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them
transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture
as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness and transpersonal experience
however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross cultural issues for instance the roles of myth ritual diet and text in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies
political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena
the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels
firstly anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state regulated sphere
secondly anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions
an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today
geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example
legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross cultural study of social ordering
earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation
more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings
public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub focus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in
the sub group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science
donna haraways cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings
digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital era technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect
it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture
the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases
these include techno anthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology
ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments
the sub field is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment
the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environments change across space and time
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology
many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land
often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly or indirectly
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park
social sciences like anthropology can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment
professor kay milton director of the anthropology research network in the school of history and anthropology describes anthropology as distinctive with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non industrial indigenous and traditional societies
anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition
milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory and finally an increased attention to globalization
environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization
anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline
knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems anthropology is now a study of human ecology
human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed
other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral universal etc
in exploring environmentalism the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected particularly from the harmful effects of human activities
environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways
anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by dependent and independent variables primitive ecological wisdom diverse environments resource management diverse cultural traditions and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture
ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names
the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures
modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it
urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism
ulf hannerz quotes a s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot anti urban by definition
various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes
there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities
these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other
by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities
by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city
anthrozoology is the study of interaction between living things
it is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy
biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture
physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences
after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non hominin primates
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present
it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present
forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition
a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable
the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law
paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology
it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints
genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field
markers on specimens such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations
contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges
the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association which was founded in
its members are anthropologists from around the globe
in a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe
the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology
hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub fields of anthropology sometimes divided up by nation or region and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines such as geology physics zoology paleontology anatomy music theory art history sociology and so on belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well
as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics
anthropologists like other researchers have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism
as part of their quest for scientific objectivity present day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the sub fields of anthropology
this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms
there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism sexism mutilation and torture
topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation to colonialism have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor sub fields
anthropologists involvement with the us government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline
franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists
but by the s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers
many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence
at the same time david h
prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies
attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up little
many anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement
numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous
the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments
no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given
the current principles of professional responsibility does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions
anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan
the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq
in the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions
after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology
there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work
one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical
the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia
in the s and s calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard
these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals
they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork
on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology
further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past
anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences
by making comparisons across cultural traditions and cultural regions anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science
because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises including but not limited to fossil hunting exploring documentary film making paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time and space
for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late s
now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors home
it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west
in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain and developing with the center founded by marc aug
since the s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale
there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists
in the th century johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum as a fertilizer
in john bennet lawes and joseph henry gilbert began a set of long term field experiments at rothamsted research in england some of which are still running as of
in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of which used the term agricultural science
the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer
the smith hughes act of shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built
for the next years after federal expenditures on agricultural research in the united states outpaced private expenditures
agriculture agricultural science and agronomy are often confused
however they cover different concepts alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in china india the muslim world and europe
in its western form alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in greco roman egypt during the first few centuries ad
alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials
common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals into noble metals the creation of an elixir of immortality and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease
the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus
the concept of creating the philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects
islamic and european alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques theories and terms some of which are still in use today
they did not abandon the ancient greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements and they tended to guard their work in secrecy often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism
in europe the th century translations of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of latin alchemy
this late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science
modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as eric j
holmyard and marie louise von franz that they should be understood as complementary
the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred
the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists
the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts
the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as
this name was itself adopted from the arabic word
the arabic in turn was a borrowing of the late greek term khmea also spelled khumeia and khma with al being the arabic definite article the
together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form
several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term
the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis who derived it from the name of a book the khemeu
hermanm diels argued in that it rather derived from used to describe metallic objects formed by casting
others trace its roots to the egyptian name meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand
according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word actually means the egyptian borrowing from the coptic word for egypt
this coptic word derives from demotic itself from ancient egyptian
the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black
alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents
these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships
one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from greco roman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths
in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions
it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other
the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the greek and roman periods
following the work of andr jean festugire modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art greek philosophy and different religious traditions
tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus
the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author can help in situating the other authors
zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewess pseudo democritus and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors
the most complete of their works the four books of pseudo democritus were probably written in the first century ad
recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices
it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way
zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence
zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices
since zosimos also called the demons the guardians of places and those who offered them sacrifices priests it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests
while critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the traditions recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples
mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion
alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation
these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others
the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus
his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes
hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemys principal symbols
according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge
the hermetica of thrice great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners
these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era
technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to bc
many writings were lost when the roman emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria
few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x
dating from ad they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver
these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements
between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art
philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character
an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire
according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed
the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are
true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word
the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form
later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth
st augustine later affirmed this in the th th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry
examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period
most of the greco roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes
others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text
after ad greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors
by the middle of the th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the th and th centuries
greek alchemy was preserved in medieval byzantine manuscripts after the fall of egypt and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of greek alchemy in the byzantine period
the nd millennium bc text vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold
a considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third century ad text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains such as saltpetre nitre perfume making granulated sugar
buddhist texts from the nd to th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold
according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim
the th century persian chemist and physician ab rayhn brn who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body and immortality while still embodied
sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess dev
some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath
other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyakrakam of ugrditya written in south india in the early th century
two famous early indian alchemical authors were ngrjuna siddha and nityantha siddha
ngrjuna siddha was a buddhist monk
his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine
nityantha siddha wrote rasaratnkara also a highly influential work
in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and ngrjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold
scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white
a modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white
the contents of sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g
jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature
the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating
chapter of himl various works on rasastra and ratnastra gives brief details of a further treatises
in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles
a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature
the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy
after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world
much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations
the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al kmiy
the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy
platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late th and early th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship
in the late ninth and early tenth centuries the arabic works attributed to jbir ibn hayyn introduced a new approach to alchemy
paul kraus who wrote the standard reference work on jabir put it as follows islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism
the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir
jabirs ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life
he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness
according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior
for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist
thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result
by this reasoning the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy
jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the elements physical properties
the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir
his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties
shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity
the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir
from the th to th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus ab al rayhn al brn avicenna and ibn khaldun
in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals
from the th century onwards many materials and practices originally belonging to indian alchemy were assimilated in the persian texts written by muslim scholars
researchers have found evidence that chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with arab alchemists during the medieval period
discovered in bc china the magic square of three was propagated to followers of ab ms jbir ibn ayyn at some point over the proceeding several hundred years
other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements
the silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods ideas ingredients religion and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined
whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine
the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists
in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears
as early as ad ge hong documented the use of metals minerals and elixirs in early chinese medicine
hong identified three ancient chinese documents titled scripture of great clarity scripture of the nine elixirs and scripture of the golden liquor as texts containing fundamental alchemical information
he also described alchemy along with meditation as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend
in his work inner chapters of the book of the master who embraces spontaneous nature hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide
in the centuries following ge hongs death the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among chinese daoists was reduced
in ad tao hongjing refuted hongs statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as shangqing meditation
while hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection he ultimately the found the scripture of the nine elixirs to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling aiming to implement more accessible practicing techniques
in the early s neidan was adopted by daoists as a new form of alchemy
neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practicing alchemy with compounds found in the body rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early dao alchemy
for example saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and didnt require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce
the inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region
although those who practiced neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation
eternal life remained a consideration for neidan alchemists as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfillment
black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists
it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life
described in th century texts and used in fireworks in china by the th century it was used in cannons by
from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in and in europe by the th century
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion
in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide
thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources chinese alchemy was introduced to the west by obed simon johnson
the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to february with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the from an arabic work attributed to khalid ibn yazid
although european craftsmen and technicians pre existed robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing
the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in th century toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath
translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and muhammad ibn zakariya al razi
these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent
alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples
meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought
the th century st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context
in the early th century peter abelard followed anselms work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west
in the early th century robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations
grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking
through much of the th and th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made
the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists
in the th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms
albertus magnus a dominican friar is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time
albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals
from the time shortly after his death through to the th century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist
likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas
roger bacon a franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time
while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology
bacons writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life
his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy
like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres
he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time
the practical confirmed the theoretical and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine
in later european legend he became an archmage
in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions
soon after bacon the influential work of pseudo geber appeared
his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods
it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described
by the end of the th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief
adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body
they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated
finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated
their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam
by purifying the two parts of mans soul man could be reunited with god
in the th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars
alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves
dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars
pope john xxiis edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists
roman catholic inquisitor general nicholas eymerichs directorium inquisitorum written in associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals which eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture
this did not however lead to any change in the inquisitions monitoring or prosecution of alchemists
in henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals
these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone
the th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova
nicolas flamel is a well known alchemist to the point where he had many pseudepigraphic imitators
although the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in
flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosophers stone
his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations
most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosophers stone
through the th and th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone
bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions
their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art
a common idea in european alchemy in the medieval era was a metaphysical homeric chain of wise men that link heaven and earth that included ancient pagan philosophers and other important historical figures
during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy
the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed
in the late th century marsilio ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin
these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent
renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel
esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala
a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists
in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy
he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy
paracelsus cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia
paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver
for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines
his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm
he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them
iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus
john dee followed agrippas occult tradition
although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work
his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below
during the th century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole
proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels
entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe
alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones
rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley
king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswick lneburg henry v duke of brunswick lneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hesse kassel all contracted alchemists
johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus
although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance
betrger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage
legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists
false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud
the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day
there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic
for example tycho brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory research institute
michael sendivogius a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around
sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in applied this in a submarine
isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics
other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont
their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science
the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the th century
as late as james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold
early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and anti aristotelian paracelsian and anti paracelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof
robert boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations
he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data
boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the th and th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of lavoisier and john dalton
beginning around a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry
by the s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud
in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the th century scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy
this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the th th and st centuries
during the occult revival of the early th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science
the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the th century held the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience
this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes
in the th century revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy
both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy
atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner
hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state
in baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion
in louis cattiaux published the message retrouv a work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy
in his lineage many researchers including emmanuel and charles dhooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium
several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy
michael maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers stone mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia
zosimos sister theosebia and isis the prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts
the first alchemist whose name we know was mary the jewess
early sources claim that mary devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry
her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes
the laboratory water bath known eponymously as the bain marie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her
essentially a double boiler it was used in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating
the tribikos and the kerotakis are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her
although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the early fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis
after the greco roman period womens names appear less frequently in alchemical literature
towards the end of the middle ages and beginning of the renaissance due to the emergence of print women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries
caterina sforza the countess of forl and lady of imola is one of the few confirmed female alchemists after mary the jewess
as she owned an apothecary she would practice science and conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories
being knowledgeable in alchemy and pharmacology she recorded all of her alchemical ventures in a manuscript named
the manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes covering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine
one of these recipes was for the water of talc
talc which makes up talcum powder is a mineral which when combined with water and distilled was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits
these supposed benefits included turning silver to gold and rejuvenation
when combined with white wine its powder form could be ingested to counteract poison
furthermore if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine it was said to be a source of protection from any poison sickness or plague
other recipes were for making hair dyes lotions lip colors
there was also information on how to treat a variety of ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer
in addition there were instructions on producing the quintessence an elixir which was believed to be able to heal all sicknesses defend against diseases and perpetuate youthfulness
she also wrote about creating the illustrious philosophers stone
due to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women
as the sixteenth century went on scientific culture flourished and people began collecting secrets
during this period secrets referred to experiments and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome
some women known for their interest in alchemy were catherine de medici the queen of france and marie de medici the following queen of france who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory
also isabella deste the marchioness of mantua made perfumes herself to serve as gifts
in this period the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was
this book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold medicine and cosmetics
however it is rumored that a man girolamo ruscelli was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers
this contributed to a bigger problem in which male authors would credit prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience
for example in the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to elisabetta gonzaga the duchess of urbino
in the same book isabella daragona the daughter of alfonso ii of naples is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury
ippolita maria sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones
mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery marks the return of women during the nineteenth century occult revival
the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study
as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements
institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism the european society for the study of western esotericism and the university of amsterdams sub department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents
a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam
journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis published by the history of science society
western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born
concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology
as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity
similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature
the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone
the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors
due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the th century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations
those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m
principe and william r
newman have interpreted the decknamen of alchemy as physical substances
these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts
at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as florin george clian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts
new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements
groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism
since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought
in the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and neo hermeticist practitioners alchemy is fundamentally spiritual
in this interpretation transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection
according to this view early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul
this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation
in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were like a veil hiding their true spiritual philosophy
in the neo hermeticist interpretation both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible
applied to the alchemist the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal
in texts that are held to have been written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning
alchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung
jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text translated by his friend richard wilhelm he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in his patients dreams visions or fantasies
he observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation a process that jung called individuation
specifically he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this process of individuation
together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marie louise von franz jung began collecting old alchemical texts compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross references and pored over them
the volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage
his writings are influential in general psychology but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces that comprise all psychic life
both von franz and jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture
among the volumes jung wrote on alchemy his magnum opus is volume of his collected works mysterium coniunctionis
alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment
literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j
rowling and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist
here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus
in the th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late sir terry pratchett
visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy
while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers
in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games
one goal of alchemy the transmutation of base substances into gold is now known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means
although not financially worthwhile gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as
an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth
they observe astronomical objects such as stars planets moons comets and galaxies in either observational or theoretical astronomy
examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies
a related but distinct subject is physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole
astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical
observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data
in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed
because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die
they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work
further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology
historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws
today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable
professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities
they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory
the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately members
this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy
the international astronomical union comprises almost members from countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond
contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a charge coupled device camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time
before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation
modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year
analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time
astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes
most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field
those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school
taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable
in college university most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics
while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs
most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties
the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from different nations
like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research
however amateurs span the range from so called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own science grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research
ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is a character encoding standard for electronic communication
ascii codes represent text in computers telecommunications equipment and other devices
because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented ascii has just code points of which only are which severely limited its scope
many computer systems instead use unicode which has millions of code points but the first of these are the same as the ascii set
the internet assigned numbers authority prefers the name us ascii for this character encoding
ascii is one of the ieee milestones
ascii was developed from telegraph code
its first commercial use was as a seven bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services
work on the ascii standard began in may with the first meeting of the american standards associations x subcommittee
the first edition of the standard was published in underwent a major revision during and experienced its most recent update during
compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters
the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in
that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in
originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified characters into seven bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above
ninety five of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z and punctuation symbols
in addition the original ascii specification included non printing control codes which originated with teletype machines most of these are now obsolete although a few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab codes
for example lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary hexadecimal decimal
despite being an american standard ascii does not have a code point for the cent
it also does not support english terms with diacritical marks such as rsum and jalapeo or proper nouns with diacritical marks such as beyonc
the american standard code for information interchange was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association called the x committee by its x subcommittee and later by that subcommittees x working group
the asa later became the united states of america standards institute and ultimately became the american national standards institute
with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code
there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet
the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks and and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard
the x task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meeting
locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified case insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers
the x committee made other changes including other new characters renaming some control characters and moving or removing others
ascii was subsequently updated as usas x then usas x ansi x and finally ansi x
in the x standard the x committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted and how it should be recorded on perforated tape
they proposed a track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats
the x subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems
like other character encodings ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols
this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate character oriented information such as written language
before ascii was developed the encodings in use included alphabetic characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols
to include all these and control characters compatible with the comit consultatif international tlphonique et tlgraphique international telegraph alphabet no
standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii
ita was in turn based on the bit telegraph code that mile baudot invented in and patented in
the committee debated the possibility of a shift function which would allow more than codes to be represented by a six bit code
in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes
it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable
the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a seven bit code
the committee considered an eight bit code since eight bits would allow two four bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary coded decimal
however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice
the committee voted to use a seven bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission
since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired
eight bit machines that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to
the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification
the first two so called ascii sticks were reserved for control characters
the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits
the committee decided it was important to support uppercase character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code
lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase
to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard
the digits are prefixed with but the remaining bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binary coded decimal straightforward
many of the non alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters
mechanical typewriters followed the de facto standard set by the remington no
the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of codice were codice early typewriters omitted and using o and l instead but codice and codice pairs became standard once and became common
thus in ascii codice were placed in the second stick positions corresponding to the digits in the adjacent stick
the parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character
this was accommodated by removing codice from and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with and
this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit paired keyboards notably the teletype model which used the left shifted layout corresponding to ascii differently from traditional mechanical typewriters
electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the ibm pc especially model m and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did
the codice pair also dates to the no
and the codice pairs were used on some keyboards or codice so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting
however ascii split the codice pair and rearranged mathematical symbols to codice
some then common typewriter characters were not included notably codice while codice were included as diacritics for international use and codice for mathematical use together with the simple line characters codice
the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position hex right before the letter a
the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message end of address end of message end of transmission who are you are you a reserved device control synchronous idle and acknowledge
these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns
ascii code order is also called asciibetical order
collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order
the main deviations in ascii order are an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values
ascii reserves the first codes for control characters which are characters originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices that make use of ascii or to provide meta information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape
for example character xa represents the line feed function and character represents backspace
refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as non whitespace control characters
except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line oriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document
other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting
the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character
the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete
probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader punch option
paper tape was a very popular medium for long term program storage until the s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape
in particular the teletype model machine assignments for codes and became de facto standards
the model was also notable for taking the description of control g literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character
because the keytop for the o key also showed a left arrow symbol a noncompliant use of code interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected
when a teletype asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control s it caused the tape reader to stop receiving control q caused the tape reader to resume
this so called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique
on some systems control s retains its meaning but control q is replaced by a second control s to resume output
the asr also could be configured to employ control r and control t to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively
the teletype could not move its typehead backwards so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a bs
instead there was a key marked that sent code
the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually input paper tape the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored
teletypes were commonly used with the less expensive computers from digital equipment corporation these systems had to use what keys were available and thus the del character was assigned to erase the previous character
because of this dec video terminals sent the del character for the key marked backspace while the separate key marked delete sent an escape sequence many other competing terminals sent a bs character for the backspace key
the unix terminal driver could only use one character to erase the previous character this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using
the assumption that no key sent a bs character allowed controlh to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs
many more of the control characters have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones
the escape character for example was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning an escape sequence
this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning
over time this interpretation has been co opted and has eventually been changed
in modern usage an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so called ansi escape code from ecma and its successors beginning with esc followed by a character
in contrast an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out of band character used to terminate an operation or special mode as in the teco and vi text editors
in graphical user interface and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit altogether
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems
the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems
teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return and line feed
the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary
the entire carriage had to be pushed to the right in order to position the paper for the next line
dec operating systems used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device would work
by the time so called glass ttys came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it
when gary kildall created cp m he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in decs rt operating system
until the introduction of pc dos in ibm had no influence in this because their s operating systems used ebcdic encoding instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless
ibms pc dos inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp m and windows in turn inherited it from ms dos
requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself
to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed alone as a line terminator
unix and unix like systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics
on the other hand the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos used carriage return alone as a line terminator however since apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the unix based macos operating system they now use line feed as well
the radio shack trs also used a lone cr to terminate lines
computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops and tenex using cr lf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used ebcdic rather than ascii encoding
the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal so that connections between hosts with different line ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network
telnet used ascii along with cr lf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt
the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode
this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for e mail and the world wide web on systems not using the nvts cr lf line ending convention
the pdp monitor and its pdp successor tops used control z as an end of file indication for input from a terminal
some operating systems such as cp m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control z to mark the end of the actual text in the file
for these reasons eof or end of file was used colloquially and conventionally as a three letter acronym for control z instead of substitute
the end of text character also known as control c was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using control z as the control character to end a file is analogous to the letter zs position at the end of the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid
a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx character convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard
the unix terminal driver uses the end of transmission character also known as control d to indicate the end of a data stream
in the c programming language and in unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such null terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero
other representations might be used by specialist equipment for example iso graphics or hexadecimal numbers
codes hex to ehex known as the printable characters represent letters digits punctuation marks and a few miscellaneous symbols
there are printable characters in total
code hex the space character denotes the space between words as produced by the space bar of a keyboard
since the space character is considered an invisible graphic it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section
code fhex corresponds to the non printable delete control character and is therefore omitted from this chart it is covered in the previous sections chart
earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret and the left arrow instead of the underscore
ascii was first used commercially during as a seven bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx network
twx originally used the earlier five bit ita which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system
bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence
his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemer ross code in europe
because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii
on march us president lyndon b
johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used
ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december when utf encoding surpassed it utf is backward compatible with ascii
as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non english languages that used roman based alphabets
one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve asciis character map in the bit range
furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii
from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard
other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling eg with code page
almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries
for example canada had its own version that supported french characters
many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non english letters currency symbols etc
see also yuscii
it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use
however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points
iso iec like ascii is a bit character set
it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries
escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general text processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway
because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso iec a german french or swedish etc
programmer using their national variant of iso iec rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as instead of c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use
many programmers kept their computers on us ascii so plain text in swedish german etc
contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to
for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get n jag har smrgsar as the answer which should be n jag har smrgsar meaning no ive got sandwiches
in japan and korea still a variation of ascii is used in which the backslash is rendered as or
this means that for example the file path cuserssmith is shown as cuserssmith or cuserssmith
in europe teletext character sets which are variants of ascii are used for broadcast tv subtitles defined by world system teletext and broadcast using the dvb txt standard for embedding teletext into dvb transmissions
in the case that the subtitles were initially authored for teletext and converted the derived subtitle formats are constrained to the same character sets
eventually as and bit computers began to replace and bit computers as the norm it became common to use an bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended bit relatives of ascii
in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original character mapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first characters
encodings include iscii viscii
although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard
most early home computer systems developed their own bit character sets containing line drawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from to with more graphics
kaypro cp m computers used the upper characters for the greek alphabet
the petscii code commodore international used for their bit systems is probably unique among post codes in being based on ascii instead of the more common ascii such as found on the zx spectrum computer
atari bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants
the ibm pc defined code page which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper positions
operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware
digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set for use in the popular vt terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics
the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript defined another character set both sets contained international letters typographic symbols and punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets
the iso iec standard finally provided a standard that most systems copied
a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing
iso windows and the original bit ascii were the most common character encodings until when utf became more common
iso iec introduced additional control codes defined in the f hexadecimal range as part of extending the bit ascii encoding to become an bit system
unicode and the iso iec universal character set have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso iec and ascii rapidly in many environments
while ascii is limited to characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification and encoding
ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first symbols so the bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets
this allows utf to be backward compatible with bit ascii as a utf file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters
even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set will preserve utf data unchanged

animation is a method by which still figures are manipulated so that they appear to be moving images
in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film
today many animations are made with computer generated imagery
computer animation can be very detailed d animation while d computer animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster real time renderings
other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three dimensional objects like paper cutouts puppets or clay figures
a cartoon is an animated film usually a short film featuring an exaggerated visual style
the style takes inspiration from comic strips often featuring anthropomorphic animals superheroes or the adventures of human protagonists
especially with animals that form a natural predator prey relationship the action often centers on violent pratfalls such as falls collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life
the illusion of animation as in motion pictures in general has traditionally been attributed to the persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain
the illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other with unnoticeable interruptions is a stroboscopic effect
while animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment
analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phnakisticope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film
television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally
for display on computers technology such as the animated gif and flash animation were developed
in addition to short films feature films television series animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects
the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics for instance moving images in magic lantern shows can also be considered animation
the mechanical manipulation of three dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata
electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics
the word animation stems from the latin animtin stem of animti meaning a bestowing of life
the earlier meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium
hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were physically manipulated in puppetry automata shadow play and the magic lantern
in the stroboscopic disc introduced the principle of modern animation which would also be applied in the zoetrope the flip book the praxinoscope and film
when cinematography eventually broke through in the s the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment
it took years before animation found its way to the cinemas
the successful short the haunted hotel by j
stuart blackton popularized stop motion and reportedly inspired mile cohl to create fantasmagorie regarded as the oldest known example of a complete traditional animation on standard cinematographic film
other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed hand drawn animation in films such as little nemo and gertie the dinosaur
during the s the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us
successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century
felix the cat who debuted in became the first fully realized animal character in the history of american animation
in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry
although disney animations actual output relative to total global animation output has always been very small the studio has overwhelmingly dominated the aesthetic norms of animation ever since
the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the s
the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel animated theatrical shorts
several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long lasting careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck fleischer studios paramount cartoon studios out of the inkwell koko the clown bimbo and betty boop popeye and casper warner bros
cartoons looney tunes porky pig daffy duck elmer fudd bugs bunny tweety wile e
coyote and road runner mgm cartoon studios tom and jerry and droopy walter lantz productions universal studio cartoons woody woodpecker terrytoons th century foxs mighty mouse and united artists pink panther
in italian argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature length film el apstol which became a critical and commercial success
it was followed by cristianis sin dejar rastros in but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government
after working on it for three years lotte reiniger released the german feature length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in the oldest extant animated feature
in walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs still one of the highest grossing traditional animation features
the fleischer studios followed this example in with gullivers travels with some success
partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war disneys next features pinocchio fantasia fleischer studios second animated feature mr bug goes to town and disneys feature films cinderella alice in wonderland and lady and the tramp failed at the box office
for decades afterward disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features
sullivan bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in
although relatively few titles became as successful as disneys features other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques
russias soyuzmultfilm animation studio founded in produced films per year on average and reached titles in
china czechoslovakia czech republic italy france and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films while japan became a true powerhouse of animation production with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation
animation became very popular on television since the s when television sets started to become common in most developed countries
cartoons were mainly programmed for children on convenient time slots and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday morning cartoons
many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the s the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series
hanna barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones scooby doo and belgian co production the smurfs
the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts matt groening the first cartoon the simpsons
quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late s and in the early s with hit series such as the simpsons as part of a renaissance of american animation
while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own child oriented programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation
japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the s and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co productions with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa wickie und die starken mnner maya the bee and the jungle book
computer animation was gradually developed since the s
d wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the s with an early appearance in the sci fi thriller futureworld
the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera
it was produced in a style thats very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late s
the so called d style more often associated with computer animation became the dominant technique following the success of pixars toy story the first computer animated feature in this style
most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the s as it proved cheaper and more profitable
not only the very popular d animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand crafted appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects
in the animation market was estimated to be worth circa us billion
by the value had increased to an estimated us billion
animated feature length films returned the highest gross margins of all film genres between and
animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early s
the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality
it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment
during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda
many american studios including warner bros
and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values
some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first feature length animation for their war efforts
animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide
some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs cereals
tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in which were very successful for the company
apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media
animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books
while many comic book characters found their way to the screen original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines
somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games have been derived from films and vice versa
some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media
stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media
songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media
while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example
since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products as have many other disney characters
this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickeys name but licensed disney products sell well and the so called disneyana has many avid collectors and even a dedicated disneyana fan club
disneyland opened in and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters
its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts
disneys earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies
criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception
with its popularity a large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated feature length films
criticisms regarding cultural representation and psychological effects on children have been raised around the animation industry which some claim has remained politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture
as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field
many are part of general or regional film award programs like the chinas golden rooster award for best animation
awards programs dedicated to animation with many categories include asifa hollywoods annie awards the emile awards in europe and the anima mundi awards in brazil
apart from academy awards for best animated short film and best animated feature animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories relatively often for best original song and best original score
beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture in
up and toy story also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten
the creation of non trivial animation works has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects
traits common to both live action and animated feature length films are labor intensity and high production costs
the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live action films
it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live action film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators
it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film
thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole
while live action films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards
another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger
animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film
since the early s teams of about to people of whom to are animators typically have created feature length animated films
it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult
this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins
character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles
on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles
unlike live action films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film
in the early s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late s
traditional animation was the process used for most animated films of the th century
the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper
to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it
the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings
the completed character cels are photographed one by one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film
the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the st century
today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system
various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects
the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm film and newer media with digital video
the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years
some animation producers have used the term tradigital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology
examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio animal farm lucky and zorba and the illusionist
traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king the prince of egypt akira spirited away the triplets of belleville and the secret of kells
full animation is the process of producing high quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation
fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros
animation studio
many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are non disney works the secret of nimh the iron giant and nocturna
fully animated films are often animated on twos sometimes on ones which means that to drawings are required for a single second of film
limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation
limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation
this is a more economic technique
pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboing boing yellow submarine and certain anime produced in japan
its primary use however has been in producing cost effective animated content for media for television and later the internet
rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in where animators trace live action movement frame by frame
the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life and a scanner darkly
some other examples are fire and ice heavy metal and aku no hana
live action animation is a technique combining hand drawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots
one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage
walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies in which a live action girl enters an animated world
other examples include allegro non troppo who framed roger rabbit volere volare space jam and osmosis jones
stop motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement
there are many different types of stop motion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation
computer software is widely available to create this type of animation traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive but more time consuming to produce than current computer animation
computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer
d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact
d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer
d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using d bitmap graphics and d vector graphics
this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping
d animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation
cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated
final line advection animation is a technique used in d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department
speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm
d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator
the d model maker usually starts by creating a d polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate
a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a d object or d environment
sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices
this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement
other techniques can be applied mathematical functions simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations
these techniques fall under the category of d dynamics
apollo or apollon is one of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology
the most greek of the gods apollo has been recognized as a god of archery music and dance truth and prophecy healing and diseases the sun and light poetry and more
one of the most important and complex of the greek gods he is the son of zeus and leto and the twin brother of artemis goddess of the hunt
seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros
apollo is known in greek influenced etruscan mythology as apulu
as the patron deity of delphi apollo is an oracular god the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle
apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil various epithets call him the averter of evil
medicine and healing are associated with apollo whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius
apollo delivered people from epidemics yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows
the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis
apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows
apollos capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona
as a protector of the young apollo is concerned with the health and education of children
he presided over their passage into adulthood
long hair which was the prerogative of boys was cut at the coming of age and dedicated to apollo
apollo is an important pastoral deity and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds
protection of herds flocks and crops from diseases pests and predators were his primary duties
on the other hand apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions is associated with dominion over colonists and was the giver of laws
his oracles might be consulted before setting laws in a city
as the god of mousike apollo presides over all music songs dance and poetry
he is the inventor of string music and the frequent companion of the muses functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations
the lyre is a common attribute of apollo
in hellenistic times especially during the th century bce as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios the personification of the sun
in latin texts however there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until st century ce
apollo and helios sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the th century ce
apollo doric arcadocypriot aeolic the name apollo unlike the related older name paean is generally not found in the linear b texts although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form pe rjo on the kn e tablet though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read hyperion
the etymology of the name is uncertain
the spelling had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier
it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings at the initiation of the young men during the family festival
according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square
apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the
beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun and suggested a pre greek proto form apalyun
several instances of popular etymology are attested by ancient authors
thus the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb to destroy
plato in cratylus connects the name with redemption with purification and with simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with ever shooting
hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds
in the ancient macedonian language means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word and
the hittite form apaliunas is attested in the manapa tarhunta letter
the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from the comparison of cypriot with doric
the name of the lydian god qdns kns may reflect an earlier kalyn before palatalization syncope and the pre lydian sound change y d
note the labiovelar in place of the labial p found in pre doric j and hittite apaliunas
a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter
apollos chief epithet was phoebus literally bright
it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light
like other greek deities he had a number of others applied to him reflecting the variety of roles duties and aspects ascribed to the god
however while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth only a few occur in latin literature
apollos birthplace was mount cynthus on the island of delos
delphi and actium were his primary places of worship
apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire
in the traditionally celtic lands he was most often seen as a healing and sun god
he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character
apollo is considered the most hellenic of the olympian gods
the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the th century bce
the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollos twin sister
at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent python
for the greeks apollo was the most greek of all the gods and through the centuries he acquired different functions
in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing
in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil
walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a dorian northwest greek component a cretan minoan component and a syro hittite component
in classical times his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil and he was therefore called apotropaios and alexikakos
apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer
some commonly used examples are paion epikourios oulios and loimios
in later writers the word paion usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing
apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god paean who did not have a cult of his own
paean serves as the healer of the gods in the iliad and seems to have originated in a pre greek religion
it is suggested though unconfirmed that he is connected to the mycenaean figure pa ja wo ne
paean was the personification of holy songs sung by seer doctors which were supposed to cure disease
homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph
such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollos son asclepius the healer
about the th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered
it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music
apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won
in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra
he sends a plague to the achaeans
knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows called a hecatomb
the homeric hymn to apollo depicts apollo as an intruder from the north
the connection with the northern dwelling dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars
the family festival was dedicated to apollo
apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros
however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella stone
stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi
george huxley regarded the identification of apollo with the minoan deity paiawon worshipped in crete to have originated at delphi
in the homeric hymn apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices
apollo delphinios or delphidios was a sea god especially worshipped in crete and in the islands
apollos sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis the minoan mistress of the animals
in her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the master of the animals a bow wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular apollo
a non greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship
the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated
omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyro babylonian texts
these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites and from there into greece
homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war
he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods
the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa in asia minor but the word is not complete
the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo
a western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus and qdns whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms in surviving lydian texts
however recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qdns with apollo
the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column
however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day indicates a babylonian origin
the late bronze age hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague invoked during plague years
here we have an apotropaic situation where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it
aplu meaning the son of was a title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash
homer interprets apollo as a terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods
in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats
all these functions including the function of the healer god paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo
the vedic rudra has some similar functions to apollo
the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva
rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is a healer physician god
however the indo european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult
unusually among the olympic deities apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi
in cult practice delian apollo and pythian apollo were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality
lycia was sacred to the god for this apollo was also called lycian
apollos cult was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce
apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity
oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites
in the nd and rd century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the so called theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all encompassing highest deity
in the rd century apollo fell silent
julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed
apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma
his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus was important enough to be consulted by croesus
oracles were also given by sons of apollo
many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies
they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations
some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order
it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures
the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order
the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances
the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection
from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings
the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms
this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics
the doric order dominated during the th and the th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms
the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple
both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome
apollo appears often in the myths plays and hymns
as zeus favorite son apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans
a divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god
apollo was the son of zeus the king of the gods and leto his previous wife or one of his mistresses
growing up apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia the personification of truth
when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma
leto sought shelter in many lands only to be rejected by them
finally the voice of unborn apollo informed his mother about a floating island named delos that had once been asteria letos own sister
since it was neither a mainland nor an island leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree
all the goddesses except hera were present to witness the event
it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia the goddess of childbirth to prevent leto from going into labor
the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber yards long
when apollo was born clutching a golden sword everything on delos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance
swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight
he was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him
since leto was unable to feed him themis the goddess of divine law fed him with nectar or ambrosia
upon tasting the divine food apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery and interpret the will of zeus to humankind
zeus who had calmed hera by then came and adorned his son with a golden headband
apollos birth fixed the floating delos to the earth
leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the delians
according to some apollo secured delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time
this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god
apollo was born on the seventh day of the month thargelion according to delian tradition or of the month bysios according to delphian tradition
the seventh and twentieth the days of the new and full moon were ever afterwards held sacred to him
mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or was born on the island of ortygia then helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo
hyperborea the mystical land of eternal spring venerated apollo above all the gods
the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games
there a vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo
apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans
his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death
no prophecies were issued during this time
he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring
the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return
it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves
henceforth hyperborea became apollos winter home and wolves became sacred to him
his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus meaning wolf like
but apollo was also the wolf slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators
the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god
shamanistic elements in apollos cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman
shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo who hailed from hyperborea
in myths the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died became the waters of the river eridanos which surrounded hyperborea
apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes
he later gave this arrow to abaris
as a child apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted
since he learnt the art of building when young he later came to be known as archegetes the founder and a god who guided men to build new cities
from his father zeus apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans
in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows he was reared by thriae the bee nymphs who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills
apollo is also said to have invented the lyre and along with artemis the art of archery
he then taught the humans the art of healing and archery
phoebe his grandmother gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as a birthday gift
themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi thereon
python a chthonic serpent dragon was a child of gaia and the guardian of the delphic oracle whose death was foretold by apollo when he was still in letos womb
python was the nurse of the giant typhon
in most of the traditions apollo was still a child when he killed python
python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death and assaulted her
to avenge the trouble given to his mother apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus
the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry hie paean
after apollo was victorious they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to him
according to homer apollo encountered and killed the python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine
according to another version when leto was in delphi python attacked her
apollo defended his mother and killed python
euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath
a detailed account of apollos conflict with gaia and zeus intervention on behalf of his young son is also given
apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his a wish that zeus granted him readily
because of this athena who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles cast her pebbles away in displeasure
however apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified
because python was a child of gaia gaia wanted apollo to be banished to tartarus as a punishment
zeus didnt agree and instead exiled his son from olympus and instructed him to get purified
apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years
after the servitude was over as per his fathers order he travelled to the vale of tempe to bath in waters of peneus
there zeus himself performed purificatory rites on apollo
purified apollo was escorted by his half sister athena to delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by gaia
according to a variation apollo had also travelled to crete where carmanor purified him
apollo later established the pythian games to appropriate gaia
henceforth apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder made men aware of their guilt and purified them
soon after zeus instructed apollo to go to delphi and establish his law
but apollo disobeying his father went to the land of hyperborea and stayed there for a year
he returned only after the delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded with him to come back
zeus pleased with his sons integrity gave apollo the seat next to him on his right side
he also gave apollo various gifts like a golden tripod a golden bow and arrows a golden chariot and the city of delphi
soon after his return apollo needed to recruit people to delphi
so when he spotted a ship sailing from crete he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin
the crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to delphi
there apollo revealed himself as a god
initiating them to his service he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts
the pythia was apollos high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies
pythia is arguably the constant favorite of apollo among the mortals
hera once again sent another giant tityos to rape leto
this time apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword
according to another version artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows
after the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus
there he was pegged to the rock floor covering an area of where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver
admetus was the king of pherae who was known for his hospitality
when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python he served as a herdsman under admetus who was then young and unmarried
apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with admetus during his stay
after completing his years of servitude apollo went back to olympus as a god
because admetus had treated apollo well the god conferred great benefits on him in return
apollos mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins
apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis the daughter of king pelias by taming a lion and a boar to draw admetus chariot
he was present during their wedding to give his blessings
when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister
when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time
according to another version or perhaps some years later when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus
apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this but his mother leto intervened and reminding zeus of their old love pleaded with him not to kill their son
zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus
the love between apollo and admetus was a favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius
the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in letos womb
niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion
she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children seven male and seven female while leto had only two
she further mocked apollos effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance
leto insulted by this told her children to punish niobe
accordingly apollo killed niobes sons and artemis her daughters
according to some versions of the myth among the niobids chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto
amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge
a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept
her tears formed the river achelous
zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them
when chloris married and had children apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids
hence nestor was able to live for generations
once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance with zeus words
apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris
apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida while poseidon built the walls of troy
other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall
in ovids account apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre
in pindars odes the gods took a mortal named aeacus as their assistant
when the work was completed three snakes rushed against the wall and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus
apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacuss descendants the aeacidae
however the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised but also threatened to bind their feet and hands and sell them as slaves
angered by the unpaid labour and the insults apollo infected the city with a pestilence and poseidon sent the sea monster cetus
to deliver the city from it laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione
during his stay in troy apollo had a lover named ourea who was a nymph and daughter of poseidon
together they had a son named ileus whom apollo loved dearly
apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans
during the war the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis the daughter of apollos priest chryses and refused to return her
angered by this apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment
he demanded that they return the girl and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad
receiving the aegis from zeus apollo entered the battlefield as per his fathers command causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry
he pushed the greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers
he is described as the rouser of armies because he rallied the trojan army when they were falling apart
when zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war apollo was provoked by poseidon to a duel
however apollo declined to fight him saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals
when the greek hero diomedes injured the trojan hero aeneas aphrodite tried to rescue him but diomedes injured her as well

aeneas was then taken to pergamos a sacred spot in troy where he was healed
after the death of sarpedon a son of zeus apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his fathers wish and cleaned it
he then gave it to sleep and death

the trojan hero hector was favored by apollo
when he got severely injured apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms

when the greek warrior patroclus tried to get into the fort of troy he was stopped by apollo
encouraging hector to attack patroclus apollo stripped the armour of the greek warrior and broke his weapons
patroclus was eventually killed by hector
at last after hectors fated death apollo protected his corpse from achilles attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse shielding it from the rays of the sun
apollo held a grudge against achilles throughout the war because achilles had murdered his son tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son troilus in his own temple
not only did apollo save hector from achilles he also tricked achilles by disguising himself as a trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates
he foiled achilles attempt to mutilate hectors dead body
finally apollo caused achilles death by guiding an arrow shot by paris into achilles heel
in some versions apollo himself killed achilles by taking the disguise of paris
apollo helped many trojan warriors including agenor polydamas glaucus in the battlefield
though he greatly favored the trojans apollo was bound to follow the orders of zeus and served his father loyally during the war
after heracles was struck with madness and killed his family he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of apollo
apollo through the pythia commanded him to serve king eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him
only then would alcides be absolved of his sin
apollo also renamed him heracles
to complete his third task heracles had to capture the ceryneian hind a hind sacred to artemis and bring back it alive
after chasing the hind for one year the animal eventually got tired and when it tried crossing the river ladon heracles captured it
while he was taking it back he was confronted by apollo and artemis who were angered at heracles for this act
however heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her
after much pleading artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later
after he was freed from his servitude to eurystheus heracles fell in conflict with iphytus a prince of oechalia and murdered him
soon after he contracted a terrible disease
he consulted the oracle of apollo once again in the hope of ridding himself of the disease
the pythia however denied to give any prophesy
in anger heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away intending to start his own oracle
however apollo did not tolerate this and stopped heracles a duel ensued between them
artemis rushed to support apollo while athena supported heracles
soon zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them
he reprimanded heracles for this act of violation and asked apollo to give a solution to heracles
apollo then ordered the hero to serve under omphale queen of lydia for one year in order to purify himself
periphas was an attican king and a priest of apollo
he was noble just and rich
he did all his duties justly
because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as zeus
at one point they worshipped periphas in place of zeus and set up shrines and temples for him
this annoyed zeus who decided to annihilate the entire family of periphas
but because he was a just king and a good devotee apollo intervened and requested his father to spare periphas
zeus considered apollos words and agreed to let him live
but he metamorphosed periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds
when periphas wife requested zeus to let her stay with her husband zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish
a long time ago there were three kinds of human beings male descended from the sun female descended from the earth and androgynous descended from the moon
each human being was completely round with four arms and four legs two identical faces on opposite sides of a head with four ears and all else to match
they were powerful and unruly
otis and ephialtes even dared to scale mount olympus
to check their insolence zeus devised a plan to humble them and improve their manners instead of completely destroying them
he cut them all in two and asked apollo to make necessary repairs giving humans the individual shape they still have now
apollo turned their heads and necks around towards their wounds he pulled together their skin at the abdomen and sewed the skin together at the middle of it
this is what we call navel today
he smoothened the wrinkles and shaped the chest
but he made sure to leave a few wrinkles on the abdomen and around the navel so that they might be reminded of their punishment

immediately after his birth apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean thus becoming the god of music
as the divine singer he is the patron of poets singers and musicians
the invention of string music is attributed to him
plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music rhythm and harmony is the gift of apollo and the muses
according to socrates ancient greeks believed that apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together both for the gods and the humans
for this reason he was called homopolon before the homo was replaced by a
apollos harmonious music delivered people from their pain and hence like dionysus he is also called the liberator
the swans which were considered to be the most musical among the birds were believed to be the singers of apollo
they are apollos sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to hyperborea
aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to apollo the swans would join the chant in unison
among the pythagoreans the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of apollo their principal deity

apollo appears as the companion of the muses and as musagetes he leads them in dance
they spend their time on parnassus which is one of their sacred places
apollo is also the lover of the muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like orpheus and linus
apollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre
in his role as the god of banquets he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods like the marriage of eros and psyche peleus and thetis
he is a frequent guest of the bacchanalia and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs
apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others
he was the victor in all those contests but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris
the invention of the lyre is attributed either to hermes or to apollo himself
distinctions have been made that hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell whereas the lyre apollo invented was a regular lyre
myths tell that the infant hermes stole a number of apollos cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks
in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides
he used one of the cows intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre
upon discovering the theft apollo confronted hermes and asked him to return his cattle
when hermes acted innocent apollo took the matter to zeus
zeus having seen the events sided with apollo and ordered hermes to return the cattle
hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented
apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre
hence apollo then became the master of the lyre
according to other versions apollo had invented the lyre himself whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to marsyas
hermes lyre therefore would be a reinvention
once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest
the mountain god tmolus was chosen to umpire
pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present
then apollo struck the strings of his lyre
it was so beautiful that tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and everyone was pleased with the judgement
only midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award
apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey
marsyas was a satyr who was punished by apollo for his hubris
he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy
athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished
when marsyas played the flute everyone became frenzied with joy
this led marsyas to think that he was better than apollo and he challenged the god to a musical contest
the contest was judged by the muses or the nymphs of nysa
athena was also present to witness the contest
marsyas taunted apollo for wearing his hair long for having a fair face and smooth body for his skill in so many arts
he also further said the muses and athena sniggered at this comment
the contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could do whatever he wanted to the loser
according to one account after the first round they both were deemed equal by the nysiads
but in the next round apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance
marsyas argued against this saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating
but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute which needed air blown from the throat it was similar to singing and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all
the nymphs decided that apollos argument was just
apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time mesmerising the audience
marsyas could not do this
apollo was declared the winner and angered with marsyas haughtiness and his accusations decided to flay the satyr
according to another account marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat
out of shame he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack
another variation is that apollo played his instrument upside down
marsyas could not do this with his instrument
so the muses who were the judges declared apollo the winner
apollo hung marsyas from a tree to flay him
apollo flayed the limbs of marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god
he then gave the rest of his body for proper burial and nailed marsyas flayed skin to a nearby pine tree as a lesson to the others
marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas
but apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away
the lyre was later discovered by the muses and apollos sons linus and orpheus
the muses fixed the middle string linus the string struck with the forefinger and orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it
they took it back to apollo but the god who had decided to stay away from music for a while laid away both the lyre and the pipes at delphi and joined cybele in her wanderings to as far as hyperborea
cinyras was a ruler of cyprus who was a friend of agamemnon

apollo loved and kidnapped an oceanid nymph melia
her father oceanus sent one of his sons caanthus to find her but caanthus could not take her back from apollo so he burned apollos sanctuary
in retaliation apollo shot and killed caanthus
hyacinth a beautiful and athletic spartan prince was one of apollos favourite lovers
the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly
apollo is said to be filled with grief
out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas
he was later resurrected and taken to heaven
the festival hyacinthia was a national celebration of sparta which commemorated the death and rebirth of hyacinthus
another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles
apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth
cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked apollo to let his tears fall forever
apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk
admetus the king of pherae was also apollos lover
during his exile which lasted either for one year or nine years apollo served admetus as a herdsman
the romantic nature of their relationship was first described by callimachus of alexandria who wrote that apollo was fired with love for admetus
plutarch lists admetus as one of apollos lovers and says that apollo served admetus because he doted upon him
latin poet ovid in his ars amatoria said that even though he was a god apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of admetus
tibullus describes apollos love to the king as servitium amoris and asserts that apollo became his servant not by force but by choice
he would also make cheese and serve it to admetus
his domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family
when admetus wanted to marry princess alcestis apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed
this satisfied alcestis father and he let admetus marry his daughter
further apollo saved the king from artemis wrath and also convinced the moirai to postpone admetus death once

apollos children who became musicians and bards include orpheus linus ialemus hymenaeus philammon eumolpus and eleuther
apollo fathered daughters apollonis borysthenis and cephisso who formed a group of minor muses the musa apollonides
they were nicknamed nete mese and hypate after the highest middle and lowest strings of his lyre
phemonoe was a seer and poet who was the inventor of hexameter
apis idmon iamus tenerus mopsus galeus telmessus and others were gifted seers
anius pythaeus and ismenus lived as high priests
most of them were trained by apollo himself
arabus delphos dryops miletos tenes epidaurus ceos lycoras syrus pisus marathus megarus patarus acraepheus cicon chaeron and many other sons of apollo under the guidance of his words founded eponymous cities
he also had a son named chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist
his other daughters include eurynome chariclo wife of chiron eurydice the wife of orpheus eriopis famous for her beautiful hair melite the heroine pamphile the silk weaver parthenos and by some accounts phoebe hilyra and scylla
apollo turned parthenos into a constellation after her early death
additionally apollo fostered and educated chiron the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods including apollos sons
apollo also fostered carnus the son of zeus and europa
marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well

to avoid her death apollo turned her into a nymph saving her life
castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved
she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt
parnassos which was then named after her
water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses
cassandra was a daughter of hecuba and priam
apollo wished to court her
cassandra promised to return his love on one condition he should give her the power to see the future
apollo fulfilled her wish but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after
angered that she broke her promise apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future no one would ever believe her prophecies
the sibyl of cumae like cassandra promised apollo her love if he would give her a boon
the sibyl took a handful of sand and asked apollo to grant her years of life as many as the grains of sand she held in her hands
apollo granted her wish but sibyl went back on her word
although sibyl did live an extended life as apollo had promised he did not give her agelessness along with it so she shrivelled and shrank and only her voice remained
hestia the goddess of the hearth rejected both apollos and poseidons marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried
in one version of the prophet tiresiass origins he was originally a woman who promised apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons
apollo gave her her wish but then she went back on her word and refused him
apollo in anger turned her into a man
artemis as the sister of apollo is thea apollousa that is she as a female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as a male divinity
in the pre hellenic period their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo
however this relationship was never sexual but spiritual which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic period
artemis like her brother is armed with a bow and arrows
she is the cause of sudden deaths of women
she also is the protector of the young especially girls
though she has nothing to do with oracles music or poetry she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang
the laurel was sacred to both
artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians at a place called hypsoi
apollo daphnephoros had a temple in eretria a place where the citizens are to take the oaths
in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon
hecate the goddess of witchcraft and magic is the chthonic counterpart of apollo
they both are cousins since their mothers leto and asteria are sisters
one of apollos epithets hecatos is the masculine form of hecate and both names mean working from afar
while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness
if hecate is the gate keeper apollo agyieus is the door keeper
hecate is the goddess of crossroads and apollo is the god and protector of streets
the oldest evidence found for hecates worship is at apollos temple in miletos
there hecate was taken to be apollos sister counterpart in the absence of artemis
hecates lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements at the same time apollos solar nature
as a deity of knowledge and great power apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena
being zeus favorite children they were given more powers and duties
apollo and athena often took up the role of protectors of cities and were patrons of some of the important cities
athena was the principal goddess of athens apollo was the principal god of sparta
as patrons of arts apollo and athena were companions of the muses the former a much more frequent companion than the latter
apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus
in the trojan war as zeus executive apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does
apollos decisions were usually approved by his sister athena and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus
in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war
apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover
orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies
apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage
they invade his temple and he drives them away
he says that the matter should be brought before athena
apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollos supplicant
apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo
the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks
as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus
on the occasion of a pestilence in the s bce apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare
during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius
in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome
after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollos temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour
he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill
sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era
the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games
also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos
athenian annual festivals included the boedromia metageitnia pyanepsia and thargelia
spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia
thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria
apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow
other attributes of his included the kithara the plectrum and the sword
another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod representing his prophetic powers
the pythian games were held in apollos honor every four years at delphi
the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games
the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos
animals sacred to apollo included wolves dolphins roe deer swans cicadas ravens hawks crows snakes mice and griffins mythical eagle lion hybrids of eastern origin
homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had a hawk as his messenger
in many myths apollo is transformed into a hawk
in addition claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawk keepers who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god
eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the citys symbol is a man with a hawklike face
claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language
as god of colonization apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies especially during the height of colonization bce
according to greek tradition he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy
however this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars
in this interpretation apollos title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves
in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and reason characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian
however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase
apollo is often associated with the golden mean
this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony
in antiquity apollo was associated with the planet mercury
the ancient greeks believed that mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening because each twilight mercury would appear farther from the sun as it set than it had the night before
the morning planet was called apollo and the one at evening hermes mercury before they realised they were the same thereupon the name mercury hermes was kept and apollo was dropped
apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance
the earliest greek word for a statue is delight and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision
greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined
the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity
the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment
the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world
numerous free standing statues of male youths from archaic greece exist and were once thought to be representations of apollo though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals
in v
leonardos proposed the term kouros to refer to those from keratea this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in to cover all statues of this format
the earliest examples of life sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos
such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone
significantly more rare are the life sized bronze statues
one of the few originals which survived into the present day so rare that its discovery in was described as a miracle by ernst homann wedeking is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo
it was found in piraeus a port city close to athens and is believed to have come from north eastern peloponnesus
it is the only surviving large scale peloponnesian statue
the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara a sophisticated seven stringed variant of the lyre in his left arm
while none of the greek originals have survived several roman copies from approximately the late st or early nd century exist of which an example is the apollo barberini
apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a cithara or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree
the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the th century
the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between and bce
the life size so called adonis found in on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars
in the late nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem roman thysdrus he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo though now even a gods divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire
another haloed apollo in mosaic from hadrumentum is in the museum at sousse
the conventions of this representation head tilted lips slightly parted large eyed curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck were developed in the rd century bce to depict alexander the great
some time after this mosaic was executed the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed
apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music dance and poetry
apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture
percy bysshe shelley composed a hymn of apollo and the gods instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinskys apollon musagte
in the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom dionysus bringer of love
apollo has been portrayed in modern literature such as when charles handy in gods of management uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture
apollo represents a role culture where order reason and bureaucracy prevail
in author rick riordan published the first book in the trials of apollo series publishing four other books in the series in and
apollo has been depicted in modern films for instance by keith david in the animated feature film hercules by luke evans in the action film clash of the titans and by dimitri lekkos in the film
apollo has appeared in many modern video games
apollo appears as a minor character in santa monica studios action adventure game god of war iii with his bow being used by peirithous
he also appears in the hi rez studios multiplayer online battle arena game smite as a playable character
in the philosophical discussion of the arts a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity
friedrich nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable
psychologist carl jungs apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over intellectualise and maintain emotional distance

the us open was their first meeting in a grand slam tournament final
agassi was favored as he was ranked no
at the time compared to the no
ranking of sampras and because agassi had defeated sampras in their only previously completed match

with both sampras and agassi participating the us won the davis cup in
the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles meeting each other twice in the finals and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year
they met five times during the year all in the title matches including the australian open the newsweek champions cup the lipton international players championships the canadian open and the us open
agassi won three of the finals including the australian open however sampras took the us open title ending agassis match winning streak
after agassi had taken most of the fall season off sampras took over the no
ranking for the end of the season
agassi admitted this loss which gave sampras a lead in their head to head meetings took two years for him to get over it mentally
in the following three years while sampras continued winning grand slam titles every season agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions
the next time sampras and agassi met in a grand slam final was at wimbledon in where sampras won in straight sets

ranking to agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that years us open which agassi went on to win

in arguably their most memorable match ever sampras defeated agassi in the us open quarterfinals in four sets
there were no breaks of serve during the entire match
reruns of the match are frequently featured on television especially during us open rain delays and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players
their last meeting was the final of the us open which was their third meeting in a us open final but the first since
the match was also notable because they had defeated several up and coming players en route to the final

andy roddick in the quarterfinals while agassi had defeated no
and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the semi finals
sampras defeated agassi in four sets
this was the final atp tour singles match of samprass career
michael chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras
they met times on the tour level with agassi leading
chang unlike most of agassis big rivals had a playing style similar to his
both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more defensive minded
the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies
the rivalry began late in the s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both being of foreign descent
agassi won the first four matches including a straight set victory in round of the us open and defeating chang the defending champion in the french open in a four set quarterfinal
arguably their best match took place in the round of of the us open
while both players presented high quality shot making the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in a five set victory
it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title
their next two grand slam meetings came in with chang recording easy straight set victories in the semi finals of both the australian open and the us open

agassi won the last four of their matches with the last being in at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime
boris becker and agassi played times with agassi leading
becker won their first three matches in and before agassi reversed the rivalry in and won of their last matches
one contributing factor is that after their third match agassi picked up a tell regarding beckers serve and knew where his serves would be directed
they first played at indian wells in with becker prevailing
their most notable match was the davis cup semi final match which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks
agassi considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass shocked becker a three time champion in a five set quarterfinal at wimbledon in on his way to his first grand slam title
the intensity of the rivalry peaked in
becker won that years wimbledon semi final after being down a set and two breaks to eventually win in four sets
in a highly anticipated rematch in the us open semi final this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets
their final match was played at hong kong in which agassi won in three sets
agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading
the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters because of the players contrasting styles of play with rafter using traditional serve volley methods against agassis variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons
agassi led on hard courts but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the rome masters
they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each
agassi won the first two in and while rafter took their and encounters the latter two matches being gruelling setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played

he returned to the tour in may in the position of coach to novak djokovic for the french open
agassi announced the end of the partnership on march stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship
early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first strike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle
on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner
his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate two handed backhand hit well cross court but especially down the line
his forehand was nearly as strong especially his inside out to the ad court
agassis strength was in dictating play from the baseline and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise
while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way
when in control of a point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more
this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in
gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassis two handed backhand down the line as his very best shot
a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes
this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it
agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early major tournament success on the red clay of roland garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career

the austroasiatic languages are a large language family in mainland southeast asia south asia and east asia
these languages are scattered throughout parts of thailand laos india myanmar malaysia bangladesh nepal and southern china
austroasiatic constitute the majority languages of vietnam and cambodia
there are around million speakers of austroasiatic languages of which more than two thirds are vietnamese speakers
of these languages only vietnamese khmer and mon have a long established recorded history
only two have official status as modern national languages vietnamese in vietnam and khmer in cambodia
the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand
in myanmar the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state
santali is one of the scheduled languages of india
the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status
ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages
these form thirteen established families which have traditionally been grouped into two as mon khmer and munda
however one recent classification posits three groups while another has abandoned mon khmer as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger family
austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india bangladesh nepal and southern china separated by regions where other languages are spoken
they appear to be the extant original languages of mainland southeast asia with the neighboring and sometimes surrounding kra dai hmong mien austronesian and sino tibetan languages being the result of later migrations
the name austroasiatic was coined by wilhelm schmidt based on the latin word for south and asia
despite the literal meaning of its name only three austroasiatic branches are actually spoken in south asia khasic munda and nicobarese
regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed full syllable
this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original proto austroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants
as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely non existent in most branches except munda and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches
the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal voice and breathy voice or between modal voice and creaky voice
languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even four way voicing contrast
however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis
vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure
much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto mon khmer in harry l
shortos mon khmer comparative dictionary
little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented
with their demotion from a primary branch proto mon khmer becomes synonymous with proto austroasiatic
paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto mon khmer as follows this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for
is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in
linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon khmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh and nepal
however no evidence for this classification has ever been published
each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade
by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated
in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional mon khmer as a valid unit
however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review
in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo
diffloths widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in encyclopdia britannica and except for the breakup of southern mon khmer in ethnologue
peiros is a lexicostatistic classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary
this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact
indeed when sidwell replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal structure below
diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published
as a schematic we have or in more detail paul sidwell in a lexicostatistical comparison of languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic
he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence
sidwell blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a khasi palaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic
if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward
sidwell blench suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that a vieto katuic connection is worth investigating
in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since proto austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly
subsequently sidwell proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other
a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake like structure with an east west division occurring possibly as early as years before present
however he still considers the subbranching dubious
integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china
sidwell tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up years bp during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by bp austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan
both the reconstructed lexicon of proto austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around bp cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments
at bp this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre neolithic hunter gatherer cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by bp and in southern indochina by bp however sidwell found that iron is not reconstructable in proto austroasiatic since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages
during the iron age about bp relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic katuic pearic and khmer were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch underwent more extensive internal diversification
by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present day locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age
paul sidwell considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around years bp during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of proto austroasiatic itself is older than that date
the lexicon of proto austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum
the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items form part of the later stratum
roger blench suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies can be reconstructed for proto austroasiatic
blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp
eel prawn shrimp crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap
archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina dates back to only about years ago with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to bp sidwell proposes that the locus of proto austroasiatic was in the red river delta area about years before present instead of the middle mekong as he had previously proposed
austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys
khmuic palaungic and khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the red valley valley
based on their current distributions about half of all austroasiatic branches can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals
hence this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino tibetan whose speakers had a distinct non riverine culture
in addition to living an aquatic based lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft
as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as sino tibetan
sidwell gives a more nested classification of austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of austroasiatic languages using a word list
many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages
pakanic and shompen were not included
roger blench also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modern day languages
john peterson suggests that pre munda languages may have once dominated the eastern indo gangetic plain and were then absorbed by indo aryan languages at an early date as indo aryan spread east
peterson notes that eastern indo aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western indo aryan languages do not
other than latin based alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer thai lao and burmese alphabets
vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing
this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the th century
the following are examples of past used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages
austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis which also includes the austronesian languages and in some proposals also the kra dai languages and the hmong mien languages
several lexical resemblances are found between the hmong mien and austroasiatic language families some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt
this could imply a relation or early language contact along the yangtze
according to cai hmong mien people are genetically related to austroasiatic speakers and their languages were heavily influenced by sino tibetan especially tibeto burman languages
it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indo aryan languages including sanskrit and middle indo aryan languages
indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages
additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha and the ngas
mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup ob which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china and haplogroup ob which is common in todays japanese koreans and are the carriers of early rice agriculturalists from indochina
another study suggests that the haplogroup ob is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and ob the para austroasiatic lineage of the korean and yayoi people
a full genomic study by lipson et al
identified a characteristic lineage that can be associated with the spread of austroasiatic languages in southeast asia and which can be traced back to remains of neolithic farmers from mn bc in the red river delta in northern vietnam and to closely related ban chiang and vat komnou remains in thailand and cambodia respectively
this austroasiatic lineage can be modeled as a sister group of the austronesian peoples with significant admixture from a deeply diverging eastern eurasian source and which is ancestral to modern austroasiatic speaking groups of southeast asia such as the mlabri and the nicobarese and partially to the austroasiatic munda speaking groups of southeast asia
significant levels of austroasiatic ancestry were also found in austronesian speaking groups of sumatra and borneo
austroasiatic speaking groups in southern china predominatly carry the same mainland southeast asian neolithic farmer ancestry but with additional geneflow from northern and southern east asian lineages that can be associated with the spread of tibeto burman and kra dai languages respectively
larena et al
could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of basal east asians in mainland southeast asia which are estimated to have formed about kya years ago and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards
early austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage which split from ancestral east asians between and years ago and were among the first wave to replace distinct australasian related groups in insular southeast asia
east asian related ancestry became dominant in insular southeast asia already between years to years ago and may be associated with austroasiatic groups which however got again replaced by later austronesian groups some to years ago
early austroasiatic people were found to be best represented by the mlabri people in modern day thailand
proposals for austroasiatic substratum among later austronesian languages in western indonesia noteworthy among the dayak languages is strengthened by genetic data suggesting austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by austronesian speakers
according to chaubey et al
austro asiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia followed by extensive sex specific admixture with local indian populations
according to riccio et al
the munda people are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia
according to zhang et al
austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum circa years ago
arunkumar et al
suggest austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia occurred into northeast india kya and into east india kya
the afroasiatic languages also known as hamito semitic or semito hamitic are a language family of about languages spoken predominantly in western asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahara and sahel
over million people are native speakers of an afroasiatic language constituting the fourth largest language family after indo european sino tibetan and niger congo
most linguists divide the family into six branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian semitic and omotic
the vast majority of afroasiatic languages are considered indigenous to the african continent including all those not belonging to the semitic branch
arabic if counted as a single language is by far the most widely spoken within the family with around million native speakers concentrated primarily in the middle east and north africa
other major afroasiatic languages include the chadic hausa language with over million speakers the semitic amharic language with million and the cushitic somali language with million
other afroasiatic languages with millions of native speakers include the cushitic sidaama language the semitic tigrinya language and the omotic wolaitta language though most languages within the family are much smaller in size
there are many well attested afroasiatic languages from antiquity that have since died or gone extinct including egyptian and the semitic languages akkadian biblical hebrew phoenician amorite and ugaritic
there is no consensus among historical linguists as to precisely where or when the common ancestor of all afroasiatic languages known as proto afroasiatic was originally spoken
however most agree that the afroasiatic homeland was located somewhere in northeastern africa with specific proposals including the horn of africa egypt the eastern sahara and the levant
the reconstructed timelines of when proto afroasiatic was spoken vary extensively with dates ranging from bc to bc
even the latest plausible dating makes afroasiatic the oldest language family accepted by contemporary linguists
comparative study of afroasiatic is hindered by the massive disparities in textual attestation between its branches while the semitic and egyptian branches are attested in writing as early as the fourth millennium bc berber cushitic and omotic languages were often not recorded until the th or th centuries
while systematic sound laws have not yet been established to explain the relationships between the various branches of afroasiatic the languages share a number of common features
one of the most important for establishing membership in the branch is a common set of pronouns
other widely shared features include a prefix m which creates nouns from verbs evidence for alternations between the vowel a and a high vowel in the forms of the verb similar methods of marking gender and plurality and some details of phonology such as the presence of pharyngeal fricatives
other features found in multiple branches include a specialized verb conjugation using suffixes a specialized verb conjugation using prefixes verbal prefixes deriving middle causative and passive verb forms and a suffix used to derive adjectives
in current scholarship the most common names for the family are afroasiatic hamito semitic and semito hamitic
other proposed names that have yet to find widespread acceptance include erythraic erythraean lisramic noahitic and lamekhite
friedrich mller introduced the name hamito semitic to describe the family in his
the variant semito hamitic is mostly used in older russian sources
the elements of the name were derived from the names of two sons of noah as attested in the book of genesiss table of nations passage semitic from the first born shem and hamitic from the second born ham
within the table of nations each of noahs sons is presented as the common progenitor of various people groups deemed to be closely related among others shem was the father of the jews assyrians and arameans while ham was the father of the egyptians and cushites
this genealogy does not reflect the actual origins of these peoples languages for example the canaanites are descendants of ham according to the table even though hebrew is now classified as a canaanite language while the elamites are ascribed to shem despite their language being totally unrelated to hebrew
the term semitic for the semitic languages had already been coined in by august ludwig von schlzer following an earlier suggestion by gottfried wilhelm leibniz in
hamitic was first used by ernest renan in to refer to languages that appeared similar to the semitic languages but were not themselves provably a part of the family
the belief in a connection between africans and the biblical ham which had existed at least as far back as isidore of seville in the th century ad led scholars in the early th century to speak vaguely of hamian or hamitish languages
the term hamito semitic has largely fallen out of favor among linguists writing in english but is still frequently used in the scholarship of various other languages such as german
several issues with the label hamito semitic have led many scholars to abandon the term and criticize its continued use
one common objection is that the hamitic component inaccurately suggests that a monophyletic hamitic branch exists alongside semitic
in addition joseph greenberg has argued that hamitic possesses racial connotations and that hamito semitic overstates the centrality of the semitic languages within the family
by contrast victor porkhomovsky suggests that the label is simply an inherited convention and doesnt imply a duality of semitic and hamitic any more than indo european implies a duality of indic and european
because of its use by several important scholars and in the titles of significant works of scholarship the total replacement of hamito semitic is difficult
while greenberg ultimately popularized the name afroasiatic in it appears to have been coined originally by maurice delafosse as french in
the name refers to the fact that it is the only major language family with large populations in both africa and asia
due to concerns that afroasiatic could imply the inclusion of all languages spoken across africa and asia the name afrasian was proposed by igor diakonoff in
at present it predominantly sees use among russian scholars
the names lisramic based on the afroasiastic root lis and the egyptian word rm and erythraean referring to the core area around which the languages are spoken the red sea have also been proposed
scholars generally consider afroasiatic to have between five and eight branches
the five that are universally agreed upon are berber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic
most specialists consider the omotic languages to constitute a sixth branch
due to the presumed distance of relationship between the various branches many scholars prefer to refer to afroasiatic as a linguistic phylum rather than a language family
victoria almansa villatoro and silvia tubov nigrelli write that there are about languages in afroasiatic ethnologue lists languages
many scholars estimate fewer languages exact numbers vary depending on the definitions of language and dialect
the berber languages are spoken today by perhaps million people
they are often considered to constitute a single language with multiple dialects
other scholars however argue that they are a group of around twelve languages about as different from each other as the romance or germanic languages
in the past berber languages were spoken throughout north africa except in egypt since the th century ce however they have been heavily affected by arabic and have been replaced by it in many places
there are two extinct languages potentially related to modern berber
the first is the numidian language represented by over a thousand short inscriptions in the libyco berber alphabet found throughout north africa and dating from the nd century bce onward
the second is the guanche language which was formerly spoken on the canary islands and went extinct in the th century ce
the first longer written examples of modern berber varieties only date from the th or th centuries ce
chadic languages number between and making chadic the largest family in afroasiatic
the chadic languages are typically divided into three major branches east chadic central chadic and west chadic
most chadic languages are located in the chad basin with the exception of hausa
hausa is the largest chadic language by native speakers and is spoken by a large number of people as a lingua franca in northern nigeria
it may have as many as to million first and second language speakers
eight other chadic languages have around speakers other chadic languages often have few speakers and may be endangered of going extinct
only about chadic languages have been fully described by linguists
there are about cushitic languages more if omotic is included spoken around the horn of africa and in sudan and tanzania
the cushitic family is traditionally split into four branches the single language of beja the agaw languages eastern cushitic and southern cushitic
only one cushitic language oromo has more than million speakers other languages with more than a million speakers include somali saho afar hadiyya and sidaama
many cushitic languages have relatively few speakers
cushitic does not appear to be related to the written ancient languages known from its area meroitic or old nubian
the oldest text in a cushitic language probably dates from around written orthographies were only developed for a select number of cushitic languages in early th century
the egyptian branch consists of a single language ancient egyptian which was historically spoken in the lower nile valley
egyptian is first attested in writing around bce and finally went extinct around ce making it the language with the longest written history in the world
egyptian is usually divided into two major periods earlier egyptian which is further subdivided into old egyptian and middle egyptian and later egyptian which is further subdivided into late egyptian demotic and coptic
coptic is the only stage written alphabetically to show vowels whereas egyptian was previously written in egyptian hieroglyphs which only represent consonants
in the coptic period there is evidence for six major dialects which presumably existed previously but are obscured by pre coptic writing additionally middle egyptian appears to be based on a different dialect than old egyptian which in turn shows dialectal similarities to late egyptian
egyptian was replaced by arabic as the spoken language of egypt but coptic continues to be the liturgical language of the coptic orthodox church
the c
omotic languages are still mostly undescribed by linguists
they are all spoken in southwest ethiopia except for the ganza language spoken in sudan
omotic is typically split into north omotic and south omotic with the latter more influenced by the nilotic languages it is unclear whether the dizoid group of omotic languages belongs to the northern or southern group
the two omotic languages with the most speakers are wolaitta and gamo gofa dawro with about million speakers each
a majority of specialists consider omotic to constitute a sixth branch of afroasiatic
omotic was formerly considered part of the cushitic branch some scholars continue to consider it part of cushitic
other scholars have questioned whether it is afroasiatic at all due its lack of several typical aspects of afroasiatic morphology
there are between and languages in the semitic family
today semitic languages are spoken across north africa western asia and the horn of africa as well as on the island of malta making them the sole afroasiatic branch with members originating outside africa
arabic spoken in both asia and africa is by far the most widely spoken afroasiatic language today with around million native speakers while the ethiopian amharic has around million
most authorities divide semitic into two branches east semitic which includes the extinct akkadian language and west semitic which includes arabic aramaic the canaanite languages as well as the ethiopian semitic languages such as geez and amharic
the classification within west semitic remains contested
the only group with an african origin is ethiopian semitic
the oldest written attestations of semitic languages come from mesopotamia northern syria and egypt and date as early as c
there is no agreement on the relationships between and subgrouping of the different afroasiatic branches
whereas marcel cohen claimed he saw no evidence for internal subgroupings numerous other scholars have made proposals with carsten peust counting as of
common trends in proposals as of include using common or lacking grammatical features to argue that omotic was the first language to branch off often followed by chadic
in contrast to scholars who argue for an early split of chadic from afroasiatic scholars of the russian school tend to argue that chadic and egyptian are closely related and scholars who rely on percentage of shared lexicon often group chadic with berber
three scholars who agree on an early split between omotic and the other subbranches but little else are harold fleming christopher ehret and lionel bender
in contrast scholars relying on shared lexicon often produce a cushitic omotic group
additionally the minority of scholars who favor an asian origin of afroasiatic tend to place semitic as the first branch to split off
disagreement on which features are innovative and which are inherited from proto afroasiatic produces radically different trees as can be seen by comparing the trees produced by ehret and igor diakonoff
responding to the above tom gldemann criticizes attempts at finding subgroupings based on common or lacking morphology by arguing that the presence or absence of morphological features is not a useful way of discerning subgroupings in afroasiatic because it can not be excluded that families currently lacking certain features did not have them in the past this also means that the presence of morphological features cannot be taken as defining a subgroup
peust notes that other factors that can obscure genetic relationships between languages include the poor state of present documentation and understanding of particular language families
gene gragg likewise argues that more needs to be known about omotic still and that afroasiatic linguists have still not found convincing isoglosses on which to base genetic distinctions
one way of avoiding the problem of determining which features are original and which are inherited is to use a computational methodology such as lexicostatistics with one of the earliest attempts being fleming
this is also the method used by alexander militarev and sergei starostin to create a family tree
fleming was a more recent attempt by fleming with a different result from militarev and starostin
hezekiah bacovcin and david wilson argue that this methodology is invalid for discerning linguistic sub relationship
they note the methods inability to detect various strong commonalities even between well studied branches of aa
a relationship between hebrew arabic and aramaic and the berber languages was perceived as early as the th century ce by the hebrew grammarian and physician judah ibn quraysh who is regarded as a forerunner of afroasiatic studies
the french orientalist guillaume postel had also pointed out similarities between hebrew arabic and aramaic in and hiob ludolf noted similarities also to geez and amharic in
this family was formally described and named semitic by august ludwig von schlzer in
in theodor benfey first described the relationship between semitic and the egyptian language and connected both to the berber and the cushitic languages
in the same year tn newman suggested a relationship between semitic and the hausa language an idea that was taken up by early scholars of afroasiatic
in ernst renan named these languages related to semitic but not semitic hamitic in carl lottner proposed that they belonged to a single language family and in friedrich mller first described them as a hamito semitic language family
mller assumed that there existed a distinct hamitic branch of the family that consisted of egyptian berber and cushitic
he did not include the chadic languages though contemporary egyptologist karl richard lepsius argued for the relation of hausa to the berber languages
some scholars would continue to regard hausa as related to the other afroasiatic languages but the idea was controversial many scholars refused to admit that the largely unwritten negroid chadic languages were in the same family as the caucasian ancient civilizations of the egyptians and semites
an important development in the history of afroasiatic scholarship and the history of african linguistics was the creation of the hamitic theory or hamitic hypothesis by lepsius fellow egyptologist christian bunsen and linguist christian bleek
this theory connected the hamites the originators of hamitic languages with caucasians who were assumed to have migrated into africa and intermixed with indigenous negroid africans in ancient times
the hamitic theory would serve as the basis for carl meinhofs highly influential classification of african languages in his book
on one hand the hamitic classification was justified partially based on linguistic features for example meinhof split the presently understood chadic family into hamito chadic and an unrelated non hamitic chadic based on which languages possessed grammatical gender
on the other hand the classification also relied on non linguistic anthropological and culturally contingent features such as skin color hair type and lifestyle
ultimately meinhofs classification of hamitic proved to include languages from every presently recognized language family within africa
the first scholar to question to existence of hamitic languages was marcel cohen in with skepticism also expressed by a
klingenheben and dietrich westermann during the s and s
however meinhofs hamitic classification remained prevalent throughout the early th century until it was definitively disproven by joseph greenberg in the s based on racial and anthropological data
instead greenberg proposed a afroasiatic family consisting of five branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian and semitic
reluctance among some scholars to recognize chadic as a branch of afroasiatic persisted as late as the s
in harold fleming proposed that a group of languages classified by greenberg as cushitic were in fact their own independent omotic branch a proposal that has been widely if not universally accepted
these six branches now constitute an academic consensus on the genetic structure of the family
greenberg relied on his own method of mass comparison of vocabulary items rather than the comparative method of demonstrating regular sound correspondences to establish the family
an alternative classification based on the pronominal and conjugation systems was proposed by an tucker in
as of widely accepted sound correspondences between the different branches have not yet been firmly established
nevertheless morphological traits attributable to the proto language and the establishment of cognates throughout the family have confirmed its genetic validity
there is no consensus as to when proto afroasiatic was spoken
the absolute latest date for when proto afroasiatic could have been extant is after which egyptian and the semitic languages are firmly attested
however in all likelihood these languages began to diverge well before this hard boundary
the estimations offered by scholars as to when proto afroasiatic was spoken vary widely ranging from bce to bce
an estimate at the youngest end of this range still makes afroasiatic the oldest proven language family
contrasting proposals of an early emergence tom gldemann has argued that less time may have been required for the divergence than is usually assumed as it is possible for a language to rapidly restructure due to areal contact with the evolution of chadic serving as pertinent examples
likewise no consensus exists as to where proto afroasiatic originated
scholars have proposed locations for the afroasiatic homeland across africa and western asia
roger blench writes that the debate possesses a strong ideological flavor with associations between an asian origin and high civilization
an additional complicating factor is the lack of agreement on the subgroupings of afroasiatic this makes associating archaeological evidence with the spread of afroasiatic particularly difficult
nevertheless there is a long accepted link between the speakers of proto southern cushitic languages and the east african savanna pastoral neolithic and archaeological evidence associates the proto cushitic speakers with economic transformations in the sahara dating c
ago as well as the speakers of the proto zenati variety of the berber languages with an expansion across the maghreb in the th century ce
an origin somewhere on the african continent has broad scholarly support and is seen as being well supported by the linguistic data
most scholars more narrowly place the homeland near the geographic center of its present distribution in the southeastern sahara or adjacent horn of africa
the afroasiatic languages spoken in africa are not more closely related to each other than they are to semitic as one would expect if only semitic had remained in an western asian homeland while all other branches had spread from there
likewise all semitic languages are fairly similar to each other whereas the african branches of afroasiatic are very diverse this suggests the rapid spread of semitic out of africa
proponents of an origin of afroasiatic within africa assume the proto language to have been spoken by pre neolithic hunter gatherers arguing that there is no evidence of words in proto afroasiatic related to agriculture or animal husbandry
christopher ehret o
keita and paul newman also argue that archaeology does not indicate a spread of migrating farmers into africa but rather a gradual incorporation of animal husbandry into indigenous foraging cultures
a significant minority of scholars supports an asian origin of afroasiatic most of whom are specialists in semitic or egyptian studies
the main proponent of an asian origin is the linguist alexander militarev who argues that proto afroasiatic was spoken by early agriculturalists in the levant and subsequently spread to africa
militarev associates the speakers of proto afroasiatic with the levantine post natufian culture arguing that the reconstructed lexicon of flora and fauna as well as farming and pastoralist vocabulary indicates that proto aa must have been spoken in this area
scholar jared diamond and archaeologist peter bellwood have taken up militarevs arguments as part of their general argument that the spread of linguistic macrofamilies can be associated with the development of agriculture they argue that there is clear archaeological support for farming spreading from the levant into africa via the nile valley
afroasiatic languages share a number of phonetic and phonological features
egyptian cushitic berber omotic and most languages in the semitic branch all require a syllable to begin with a consonant
igor diakonoff argues that this constraint goes back to proto afroasiatic
some chadic languages allow a syllable to begin with a vowel however in many chadic languages verbs must begin with a consonant
in cushitic and chadic languages a glottal stop or glottal fricative may be inserted to prevent a word from beginning with a vowel
typically syllables only begin with a single consonant
with the exception of some chadic languages all afroasiatic languages allow both closed and open syllables many chadic languages do not allow a syllable to end in a consonant
most words end in a vowel in omotic and cushitic making syllable final consonant clusters rare
diakonoff argues that proto afroasiatic syllables disallowed consonant clusters or vowels at the end of a syllable
syllable weight plays an important role in aa especially in chadic it can affect the form of affixes attached to a word
several afroasiatic languages have large consonant inventories and it is likely that this is inherited from proto afroasiatic
all afroasiatic languages contain stops and fricatives some branches have additional types of consonants such as affricates and lateral consonants
aa languages tend to have pharyngeal fricative consonants with egyptian semitic berber and cushitic sharing and
in all aa languages consonants can be bilabial alveolar velar and glottal with additional places of articulation found in some branches or languages
additionally the glottal stop usually exists as a phoneme and there tends to be no phonemic contrast between and means the concentration of ho
the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid base reactions
the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid and the products are the conjugate base and h
the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton
because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka log ka
stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids
experimentally determined pka at c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material
arrhenius acids are named according to their anions
in the classical naming system the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table following
the prefix hydro is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element
for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the hydro prefix is used and the ide suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid
classical naming system in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound
thus for hydrogen chloride as an acid solution the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride
the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton
a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base a and none of the protonated acid ha
in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution
examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid hydroiodic acid hydrobromic acid perchloric acid nitric acid and sulfuric acid
in water each of these essentially ionizes
the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h
two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the h a bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the h a bond
acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base
stronger acids have a larger acid dissociation constant ka and a lower pka than weaker acids
sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids
a common example is toluenesulfonic acid
unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids
in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable
superacids are acids stronger than sulfuric acid
examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid
superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts
they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations
while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution
the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka
lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths
the relative acceptor strength of lewis acids toward a series of bases versus other lewis acids can be illustrated by c b plots
it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered
for pearsons qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for dragos quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent
common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid and nitric acid
on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid
examples in organic acids include formic acid acetic acid and benzoic acid
polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule
specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid and triprotic acid
some macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids can have a very large number of acidic protons
a diprotic acid can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph
each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka and ka
the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second
for example sulfuric acid can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion for which ka is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion wherein the ka is intermediate strength
the large ka for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid
in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion and lose a second to form carbonate anion
both ka values are small but ka ka
a triprotic acid can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka ka ka
an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid usually just called phosphoric acid
all three protons can be successively lost to yield hpo then hpo and finally po the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate
even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged
an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion
although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution
the fractional concentration for each species can be calculated
for example a generic diprotic acid will generate species in solution ha ha and a
the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k and k is known as a bjerrum plot
a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times where k and the other k terms are the dissociation constants for the acid
neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid
it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction
neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt
an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia
conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt
in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid
the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form
in lower ph solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form
solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions
to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution an acid base titration is commonly performed
a strong base solution with a known concentration usually naoh or koh is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added
the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes with the base volume on the x axis and the solutions ph value on the y axis
the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution
for each diprotic acid titration curve from left to right there are two midpoints two equivalence points and two buffer regions
due to the successive dissociation processes there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid
the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated
in other words the amount of oh added equals the original amount of ha at the first equivalence point
the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated
therefore the amount of oh added equals twice the amount of ha at this time
for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base the second equivalence point must occur at ph above due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution
at either equivalence point adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system
a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where phpka
since there are two different ka values the first midpoint occurs at phpka and the second one occurs at phpka
each segment of the curve that contains a midpoint at its center is called the buffer region
because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points
acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in modern industry
sulfuric acid a diprotic acid is the most widely used acid in industry and is also the most produced industrial chemical in the world
it is mainly used in producing fertilizer detergent batteries and dyes as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities
according to the statistics data in the annual production of sulfuric acid was around million tonnes in the world
for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning
in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts
for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer
additionally carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols to produce esters
acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling
they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery
tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind
natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids
citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits
oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid
ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla lemon citrus fruits and guava
many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives
phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks
acetic acid is used in day to day life as vinegar
citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles
carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks
during the manufacturing process co is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid
carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co at room temperature and pressure
therefore when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co bubbles come out
certain acids are used as drugs
acetylsalicylic acid is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers
acids play important roles in the human body
the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules
amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues
fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues
nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes
carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body
human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors
many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins
other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the bodys ph from undergoing large scale changes that would be harmful to cells
the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies
acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline
some acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration and condensation reactions
in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis
many biologically important molecules are acids
nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate groups include dna and rna
nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring
dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits
cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids
an amino acid has a central carbon that is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group an amino group a hydrogen atom and a variable group
the variable group also called the r group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid
in glycine the simplest amino acid the r group is a hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen
with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the
peptidoglycan found in some bacterial cell walls contains some d amino acids
at physiological ph typically around free amino acids exist in a charged form where the acidic carboxyl group loses a proton and the basic amine group gains a proton
the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains
aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for a net charge of at physiological ph
fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology
these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end
the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups
membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in acid base reactions
in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive pro enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin
some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid
acid base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing
oxygen gas drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide as a byproduct
oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation
for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing co into the blood stream
in aqueous solutions such as blood co exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion
it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess co and resupplying the cells with o
a sulfonic acid has the general formula rs oh where r is an organic radical
a carboxylic acid has the general formula r coh where r is an organic radical
the carboxyl group coh contains a carbonyl group co and a hydroxyl group o h
halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid
normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group
in vinylogous carboxylic acids a carbon carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups
bitumen is a sticky black highly viscous liquid or semi solid form of petroleum
in the us it is commonly referred to as asphalt
it may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product and is classed as a pitch
before the th century the term asphaltum was also used
the word is derived from the ancient greek sphaltos
the largest natural deposit of bitumen in the world estimated to contain million tons is the pitch lake in southwest trinidad
the primary use of bitumen is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete
its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs
in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common
worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material
for the manufactured material which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world however in american english asphalt is more commonly used
to help avoid confusion the phrases liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the us colloquially various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits although tar is a different material
naturally occurring bitumen is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen
its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen
the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands which cover an area larger than england
the word bitumen is from latin and passed via french into english
the latin word traces to the proto indo european root pitch see that link for other cognates
the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek a word meaning asphalt bitumen pitch which perhaps derives from not without ie the alpha privative and to cause to fall baffle err be balked of
the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application
specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall
from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french and english
in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt soaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads
bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today
in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen
however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete
in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product
diluted bitumen is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit
bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi solid form of petroleum
bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen
the oil sands of alberta canada are a similar material
neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars
tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested
the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined in long chains in the absence of oxygen
bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid
it may even be mixed in with coal deposits
bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around
bitumen typically contains elementally by weight of carbon hydrogen up to sulfur and molecularly between and by weight of asphaltenes dispersed in to maltenes
most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds nickel and vanadium are found at by intrauterine instillation and by other
according to the cdc due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortions if the removal of the dead fetus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion
the guttmacher institute estimated there were intact dilation and extraction procedures in the us during this accounts for the reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world
some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child domestic violence lack of support feeling they are too young and the wish to complete education or advance a career
additional reasons include not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or incest
some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures
these might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race disapproval of single or early motherhood stigmatization of people with disabilities insufficient economic support for families lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods or efforts toward population control
these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex selective abortion
an additional factor is maternal health which was listed as the main reason by about a third of women in of countries and about of women in a further of these countries
in the us the supreme court decisions in roe v
wade and doe v
bolton ruled that the states interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother
even after the point of viability the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman
under the right of privacy physicians must be free to use their medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother
on the same day that the court decided roe it also decided doe v
bolton in which the court defined health very broadly the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the well being of the patient
all these factors may relate to health
this allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment
public opinion shifted in america following television personality sherri finkbines discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to thalidomide
unable to obtain a legal abortion in the united states she traveled to sweden
from to an outbreak of german measles left babies with severe birth defects
in the american medical association publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws
a national opinion research center poll in showed supported abortion when the mothers life was at risk when birth defects were present and for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest
the rate of cancer during pregnancy is and in many cases cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment
this is particularly true for cervical cancer the most common type of which occurs in of every pregnancies for which initiation of treatment cannot co exist with preservation of fetal life
very early stage cervical cancers may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection radiation therapy or both while later stages are treated by radiotherapy
chemotherapy may be used simultaneously
treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations because lumpectomy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mastectomy unless late term pregnancy allows follow up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth
exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a risk of teratogenic effects on the fetus with higher risks for multiple drug treatments
treatment with more than gy of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion
exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester especially to weeks of development can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight
exposures above gy cause a dose dependent reduction in iq
it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus
the process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk
according to li et al
aginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels haemorrhage cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non surgical treatment
since ancient times abortions have been done using a number of methods including herbal medicines acting as abortifacients sharp tools through the use of force or through other traditional medicine methods
induced abortion has a long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as ancient china ancient india since its vedic age ancient egypt with its ebers papyrus and the roman empire in the time of juvenal
one of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at angkor wat
found in a series of friezes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion
in judaism the fetus is not considered to have a human soul until it is safely outside of the woman is viable and has taken its first breath
the fetus is considered valuable property of the woman and not a human life while in the womb
while judaism encourages people to be fruitful and multiply by having children abortion is allowed and is deemed necessary when a pregnant womans life is in danger
several religions including judaism which disagree that human life begins at conception support the legality of abortion on religious freedom grounds
in islam abortion is traditionally permitted until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fetus considered by various theologians to be at conception days after conception days after conception or quickening
abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa
some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hippocratic oath forbade physicians in ancient greece from performing abortions other scholars disagree with this interpretation and state that the medical texts of hippocratic corpus contain descriptions of abortive techniques right alongside the oath
the physician scribonius largus wrote in ce that the hippocratic oath prohibits abortion as did soranus of ephesus although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly at the time
according to soranus st or nd century ce work gynaecology one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the hippocratic oath the other party to which he belonged was willing to prescribe abortions only for the sake of the mothers health
in politics aristotle condemned infanticide as a means of population control
he preferred abortion in such cases with the restriction that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive
in the catholic church opinion was divided on how serious abortion was in comparison with such acts as contraception oral sex and sex in marriage for pleasure rather than procreation
the catholic church did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the th century
as early as ce the didache taught that abortion was sinful
several historians argue that prior to the th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before quickening or ensoulment as an abortion
among these authors were the doctors of the church such as st
augustine st
thomas aquinas and st
alphonsus liguori
in pope sixtus v was the only pope before pope pius ix to institute a church policy labeling all abortion as homicide and condemning abortion regardless of the stage of pregnancy
sixtus vs pronouncement was reversed in by pope gregory xiv
in the recodification of code of canon law apostolicae sedis was strengthened in part to remove a possible reading that excluded excommunication of the mother
statements made in the catechism of the catholic church the codified summary of the churchs teachings considers abortion from the moment of conception as homicide and called for the end of legal abortion
denominations that support abortion rights with some limits include the united methodist church episcopal church evangelical lutheran church in america and presbyterian church usa
a guttmacher survey of abortion patients in the united states found that many reported a religious affiliation were catholic while were protestant
a survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy protestants are less likely to do so and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so
a pew research center study found that most christian denominations were against overturning roe v
wade which in the united states legalized abortion at around except white evangelicals at
abortion has been a fairly common practice and was not always illegal or controversial until the th century
under common law including early english common law dating back to edward coke in abortion was generally permitted before quickening and at womens discretion it was whether abortion was performed after quickening that determined if it was a crime
in europe and north america abortion techniques advanced starting in the th century the conservatism of most in the medical profession with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of abortion techniques
other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services and they were not widely regulated until the th century when the practice sometimes called restellism was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom
some th century physicians one of the most famous and consequential being american horatio storer argued for anti abortion laws on racist and misogynist as well as moral grounds
church groups were also highly influential in anti abortion movements and religious groups more so since the th century
some of the early anti abortion laws punished only the doctor or abortionist and while women could be criminally tried for a self induced abortion they were rarely prosecuted in general
in the united states some argued that abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about when incremental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer
others maintain that in the th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe
several scholars argue that despite improved medical procedures the period from the s until the s saw more zealous enforcement of anti abortion laws alongside an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime
in soviet russia became the first country to legalize abortion after lenin insisted that no woman be forced to give birth
iceland and sweden would follow suit to legalize certain or all forms of abortion
in nazi germany a law permitted abortions for those deemed hereditarily ill while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortions
beginning in the second half of the th century abortion was legalized in a greater number of countries
in japan abortion was first legalized by the eugenics protection law meant to prevent the births of inferior humans
due to japans continuing strongly patriarchal culture and traditional views on womens societal roles women who want an abortion must normally get written permission from their partner
induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate
ethical moral philosophical biological religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems
opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights governmental authority and womens rights
in both public and private debate arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion or the justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion
the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated
abortion debates especially pertaining to abortion laws are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions
groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion including complete prohibition most often describe themselves as pro life while groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as pro choice
current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse
religious moral and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world
the right to life the right to liberty the right to security of person and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws
in jurisdictions where abortion is legal certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a legal abortion
these requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus often using a trimester based system to regulate the window of legality or as in the us on a doctors evaluation of the fetus viability
some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure prescribe the distribution of information on fetal development or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion
other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fetus father before aborting the fetus that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure sometimes including risks not supported by the medical literature and that multiple medical authorities certify that the abortion is either medically or socially necessary
many restrictions are waived in emergency situations
china which has ended their one child policy and now has a two child policy has at times incorporated mandatory abortions as part of their population control strategy
other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely
many but not all of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances
these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest the fetus development is impaired the womans physical or mental well being is endangered or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship
in countries where abortion is banned entirely such as nicaragua medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies
some countries such as bangladesh that nominally ban abortion may also support clinics that perform abortions under the guise of menstrual hygiene
this is also a terminology in traditional medicine
in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pregnancies
women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortions or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves
the organization women on waves has been providing education about medical abortions since
the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws
because the ships are registered in the netherlands dutch law prevails when the ship is in international waters
while in port the organization provides free workshops and education while in international waters medical personnel are legally able to prescribe medical abortion drugs and counseling
sonography and amniocentesis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth
the development of this technology has led to sex selective abortion or the termination of a fetus based on its sex
the selective termination of a female fetus is most common
sex selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries
the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan south korea india and china
this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex selective abortion or even sex screening
in china a historical preference for a male child has been exacerbated by the one child policy which was enacted in
many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex selective abortion
at the international conference on population and development in over states agreed to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in
the world health organization and unicef along with other united nations agencies have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex selective abortions than measures to reduce gender inequality
in a number of cases abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence including murder attempted murder kidnapping stalking assault arson and bombing
anti abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism
in the us and canada over incidents of violence trespassing and death threats have been recorded by providers since including over bombings arsons and hundreds of assaults
the majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts
in the united states four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered david gunn john britton barnett slepian and george tiller
also murdered in the us and australia have been other personnel at abortion clinics including receptionists and security guards such as james barrett shannon lowney lee ann nichols and robert sanderson
woundings and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada
hundreds of bombings arsons acid attacks invasions and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred
notable perpetrators of anti abortion violence include eric robert rudolph scott roeder shelley shannon and paul jennings hill the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider
legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal
these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction vandalism picketing and other actions or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment
far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure
in chris danze organized anti abortion organizations throughout texas to prevent the construction of a planned parenthood facility in austin
the organizations released the personal information online of those involved with construction sent them up to phone calls a day and contacted their churches
some protestors record women entering clinics on camera
spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals
for example in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs
in cows abortion may be caused by contagious disease such as brucellosis or campylobacter but can often be controlled by vaccination
eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows
several plants including broomweed skunk cabbage poison hemlock and tree tobacco are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats
in horses a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has lethal white syndrome
foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth
in many species of sharks and rays stress induced abortions occur frequently on capture
viral infection can cause abortion in dogs
cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons including hormonal imbalance
a combined abortion and spaying is performed on pregnant cats especially in trap neuter return programs to prevent unwanted kittens from being born
female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy known as the bruce effect
abortion may also be induced in animals in the context of animal husbandry
for example abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant or that are pregnant with twin foals
feticide can occur in horses and zebras due to male harassment of pregnant mares or forced copulation although the frequency in the wild has been questioned
male gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover causing miscarriage
in law an abstract is a brief statement that contains the most important points of a long legal document or of several related legal papers
the abstract of title used in real estate transactions is the more common form of abstract
an abstract of title lists all the owners of a piece of land a house or a building before it came into possession of the present owner
the abstract also records all deeds wills mortgages and other documents that affect ownership of the property
an abstract describes a chain of transfers from owner to owner and any agreements by former owners that are binding on later owners
in the context of patent law and specifically in prior art searches searching through abstracts is a common way to find relevant prior art document to question to novelty or inventive step of an invention
under united states patent law the abstract may be called abstract of the disclosure
the american revolutionary war also known as the revolutionary war or american war of independence was the military conflict of the american revolution in which american patriot forces under george washingtons command defeated the british establishing and securing the independence of the united states
fighting began on april at the battles of lexington and concord
the war was formalized and intensified following passage of the lee resolution which asserted that the thirteen colonies were free and independent states by the second continental congress in philadelphia on july and the unanimous ratification of the declaration of independence two days later on july
in the war american patriot forces were supported by the kingdom of france and the kingdom of spain
the british in turn were supported by hessian soldiers from germany some american indians loyalists and freedmen
the conflict was fought in north america the caribbean and the atlantic ocean
the american colonies were established by royal charter in the th and th centuries
they were initially largely autonomous in domestic affairs and commercially prosperous trading with britain its caribbean colonies and other european powers via their caribbean entrepts
after the british gained victory over the french in the seven years war in tensions and disputes arose between britain and the colonies over policies related to trade trans appalachian settlement and taxation including the stamp and townshend acts
colonial opposition led to the boston massacre in which strengthened american patriots desire for independence from britain
the british responded by repealing earlier taxation measures
but in the british parliament adopted the tea act a measure which led to the boston tea party on december
in response the british parliament imposed the intolerable acts in mid closed boston harbor and revoked massachusetts charter which placed the colony under the british monarchys direct governance
these measures stirred unrest throughout the colonies of which sent delegates to the first continental congress in philadelphia in early september to protest the measures and deliberate on potential responses
in philadelphia the congress drafted a petition to the king asking for peace and threatened a boycott of british goods known as the continental association if the intolerable acts were not withdrawn
fighting began at the battle of lexington on april
in june the second continental congress formalized patriot militias into the continental army and appointed george washington its commander in chief
the coercion policy advocated by the north ministry was opposed by a faction within the british parliament but both sides began to see military conflict as inevitable
congress sent the olive branch petition to king george iii in july but he rejected it and the british parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in august
as the revolutionary war formally launched washingtons forces drove the british army out of boston during the siege of boston in march and british commander in chief william howe responded by launching the new york and new jersey campaign
howe captured new york city in november and washington responded by clandestinely crossing the delaware river and winning small but significant victories at trenton and princeton which restored patriot confidence
in summer as howe was poised to capture philadelphia the continental congress prepared for philadelphias fall by fleeing the city for baltimore where they convened at henry fite house and protecting the liberty bell by relocating it to zion reformed church in allentown where it was hidden under the churchs floorboards for nine months
in october a separate british force under the command of john burgoyne was forced to surrender at saratoga in an american victory that proved crucial in convincing france and spain that an independent united states was a viable possibility
with philadelphia still occupied by the british washington and continental army troops secured refuge in valley forge from december to june
at valley forge general von steuben drilled the continental army into a more viable fighting unit but as many as continental army troops died from disease and possibly malnutrition over a brutal winter
france provided the continental army with informal economic and military support from the beginning of the war
after saratoga the two countries signed a commercial agreement and a treaty of alliance in february
in spain also allied with france against britain in the treaty of aranjuez though spain did not formally ally with the americans
access to ports in spanish louisiana allowed american patriots to import arms and supplies while the spanish gulf coast campaign deprived the british royal navy of key bases in the american south
closure of american ports undermined the strategy devised by howes replacement henry clinton which intended to take the war against the americans into the south
despite some initial success cornwallis was besieged by a franco american force in yorktown in september and october
cornwallis attempted to resupply the garrison but failed and was forced to surrender in october
the british wars with france and spain continued for another two years but britains forces in america were largely confined to several harbors and forts in great lakes and fighting largely ceased in america
in april the north ministry was replaced by a new british government which accepted american independence and began negotiating the treaty of paris ratified on september and britain acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the united states of america bringing the american revolutionary war to an end
the treaties of versailles resolved britains conflicts with france and spain
the french and indian war part of the wider global conflict known as the seven years war ended with the peace of paris which expelled france from britains possessions in new france
acquisition of territories in atlantic canada and west florida inhabited largely by french or spanish speaking catholics led british authorities to consolidate their hold by populating them with english speaking settlers
preventing conflict between settlers and indian tribes west of the appalachian mountains also avoided the cost of an expensive military occupation
the royal proclamation of was designed to achieve these aims by refocusing colonial expansion north into nova scotia and south into florida with the mississippi river as the dividing line between british and spanish possessions in america
settlement was tightly restricted beyond the limits and claims west of this line including by virginia and massachusetts were rescinded despite the fact that each colony argued that their boundaries extended from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean
the vast exchange of territory ultimately destabilized existing alliances and trade networks between settlers and indians in the west while it proved impossible to prevent encroachment beyond the proclamation line
with the exception of virginia and others deprived of rights to western lands the colonial legislatures agreed on the boundaries but disagreed on where to set them
many settlers resented the restrictions entirely and enforcement required permanent garrisons along the frontier which led to increasingly bitter disputes over who should pay for them
although directly administered by the crown acting through a local governor the colonies were largely governed by native born property owners
while external affairs were managed by london colonial militia were funded locally but with the ending of the french threat in the legislatures expected less taxation not more
at the same time the huge debt incurred by the seven years war and demands from british taxpayers for cuts in government expenditure meant parliament expected the colonies to fund their own defense
the to grenville ministry instructed the royal navy to cease trading smuggled goods and enforce customs duties levied in american ports
the most important was the molasses act routinely ignored prior to it had a significant economic impact since of new england rum exports were manufactured from imported molasses
these measures were followed by the sugar act and stamp act which imposed additional taxes on the colonies to pay for defending the western frontier
in july the whigs formed the first rockingham ministry which repealed the stamp act and reduced tax on foreign molasses to help the new england economy but re asserted parliamentary authority in the declaratory act
however this did little to end the discontent in a riot started in boston when the authorities seized the sloop liberty on suspicion of smuggling
tensions escalated further in march when british troops fired on rock throwing civilians killing five in what became known as the boston massacre
the massacre coincided with the partial repeal of the townshend acts by the tory based north ministry which came to power in january and remained in office until
north insisted on retaining duty on tea to enshrine parliaments right to tax the colonies the amount was minor but ignored the fact it was that very principle americans found objectionable
tensions escalated following the destruction of a customs vessel in the june gaspee affair then came to a head in
a banking crisis led to the near collapse of the east india company which dominated the british economy to support it parliament passed the tea act giving it a trading monopoly in the thirteen colonies
since most american tea was smuggled by the dutch the act was opposed by those who managed the illegal trade while being seen as yet another attempt to impose the principle of taxation by parliament
in december a group called the sons of liberty disguised as mohawk natives dumped crates of tea into boston harbor an event later known as the boston tea party
the british parliament responded by passing the so called intolerable acts aimed specifically at massachusetts although many colonists and members of the whig opposition considered them a threat to liberty in general
this led to increased sympathy for the patriot cause locally in british parliament and in the london press
throughout the th century the elected lower houses in the colonial legislatures gradually wrested power from their royal governors
dominated by smaller landowners and merchants these assemblies now established ad hoc provincial legislatures variously called congresses conventions and conferences effectively replacing royal control
with the exception of georgia twelve colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress to agree on a unified response to the crisis
many of the delegates feared that an all out boycott would result in war and sent a petition to the king calling for the repeal of the intolerable acts
however after some debate on september congress endorsed the massachusetts suffolk resolves and on october passed the continental association based on a draft prepared by the first virginia convention in august the association instituted economic sanctions and a full boycott of goods against britain
while denying its authority over internal american affairs a faction led by james duane and future loyalist joseph galloway insisted congress recognize parliaments right to regulate colonial trade
expecting concessions by the north administration congress authorized the extralegal committees and conventions of the colonial legislatures to enforce the boycott this succeeded in reducing british imports by from to
however on february parliament declared massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and instituted a blockade of the colony
in july the restraining acts limited colonial trade with the british west indies and britain and barred new england ships from the newfoundland cod fisheries
the increase in tension led to a scramble for control of militia stores which each assembly was legally obliged to maintain for defense
on april a british attempt to secure the concord arsenal culminated in the battles of lexington and concord which began the revolutionary war
after the patriot victory at concord moderates in congress led by john dickinson drafted the olive branch petition offering to accept royal authority in return for george iii mediating in the dispute
however since the petition was immediately followed by the declaration of the causes and necessity of taking up arms colonial secretary lord dartmouth viewed the offer as insincere he refused to present the petition to the king which was therefore rejected in early september
although constitutionally correct since george could not oppose his own government it disappointed those americans who hoped he would mediate in the dispute while the hostility of his language annoyed even loyalist members of congress
combined with the proclamation of rebellion issued on august in response to the battle at bunker hill it ended hopes of a peaceful settlement
backed by the whigs parliament initially rejected the imposition of coercive measures by votes fearing an aggressive policy would simply drive the americans towards independence
however by the end of the collapse of british authority meant both lord north and george iii were convinced war was inevitable
after boston gage halted operations and awaited reinforcements the irish parliament approved the recruitment of new regiments while allowing catholics to enlist for the first time
britain also signed a series of treaties with german states to supply additional troops
within a year it had an army of over men in america the largest ever sent outside europe at the time
the employment of german soldiers against people viewed as british citizens was opposed by many in parliament and by the colonial assemblies combined with the lack of activity by gage opposition to the use of foreign troops allowed the patriots to take control of the legislatures
support for independence was boosted by thomas paines pamphlet common sense which was published january and argued for american self government and was widely reprinted
to draft the declaration of independence the second continental congress appointed the committee of five consisting of thomas jefferson john adams benjamin franklin roger sherman and robert livingston
the declaration was written almost exclusively by jefferson who wrote it largely in isolation between june and june in a three story residence at market street in philadelphia
identifying inhabitants of the thirteen colonies as one people the declaration simultaneously dissolved political links with britain while including a long list of alleged violations of english rights committed by george iii
this is also one of the foremost times that the colonies were referred to as united states rather than the more common united colonies
on july congress voted for independence and published the declaration on july which washington read to his troops in new york city on july
at this point the revolution ceased to be an internal dispute over trade and tax policies and had evolved into a civil war since each state represented in congress was engaged in a struggle with britain but also split between american patriots and american loyalists
patriots generally supported independence from britain and a new national union in congress while loyalists remained faithful to british rule
estimates of numbers vary one suggestion being the population as a whole was split evenly between committed patriots committed loyalists and those who were indifferent
others calculate the split as patriot neutral loyalist but with considerable regional variations
at the onset of the war the second continental congress realized defeating britain required foreign alliances and intelligence gathering
the committee of secret correspondence was formed for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in great britain and other parts of the world
from to the committee shared information and built alliances through secret correspondence as well as employing secret agents in europe to gather intelligence conduct undercover operations analyze foreign publications and initiate patriot propaganda campaigns
paine served as secretary while benjamin franklin and silas deane sent to france to recruit military engineers were instrumental in securing french aid in paris
the revolutionary war included two principal campaign theaters within the thirteen colonies and a smaller but strategically important third one west of the appalachian mountains
fighting began in the northern theater and was at its most severe from to
american patriots achieved several strategic victories in the south
the americans defeated the british army at saratoga in october and the french seeing the possibility for an american patriot victory in the war formally entered the war as an american ally
during washington prevented the british army from breaking out of new york city while militia under george rogers clark conquered western quebec supported by francophone settlers and their indian allies which became the northwest territory
the war became a stalemate in the north in so the british initiated their southern strategy which aimed to mobilize loyalist support in the region and occupy american patriot controlled territory north to chesapeake bay
the campaign was initially successful with the british capture of charleston being a major setback for southern patriots however a franco american force surrounded the british army at yorktown and their surrender in october effectively ended fighting in america
on april sir thomas gage commander in chief north america since and also governor of massachusetts from received orders to take action against the patriots
he decided to destroy militia ordnance stored at concord massachusetts and capture john hancock and samuel adams who were considered the principal instigators of the rebellion
the operation was to begin around midnight on april in the hope of completing it before the american patriots could respond
however paul revere learned of the plan and notified captain parker commander of the concord militia who prepared to resist the attempted seizure
the first action of the war commonly referred to as the shot heard round the world was a brief skirmish at lexington followed by the full scale battles of lexington and concord
british troops suffered around casualties before withdrawing to boston which was then besieged by the militia
in may british reinforcements arrived under generals william howe john burgoyne and sir henry clinton
on june they seized the charlestown peninsula at the battle of bunker hill a frontal assault in which they suffered over casualties
dismayed at the costly attack which had gained them little gage appealed to london for a larger army to suppress the revolt but instead was replaced as commander by howe
on june congress took control of american patriot forces outside boston and congressional leader john adams nominated george washington as commander in chief of the newly formed continental army
washington previously commanded virginia militia regiments in the french and indian war and on june john hancock officially proclaimed him general and commander in chief of the army of the united colonies
he assumed command on july preferring to fortify dorchester heights outside boston rather than assaulting it
in early march colonel henry knox arrived with heavy artillery acquired in the capture of fort ticonderoga
under cover of darkness on march washington placed these on dorchester heights from where they could fire on the town and british ships in boston harbor
fearing another bunker hill howe evacuated the city on march without further loss and sailed to halifax nova scotia while washington moved south to new york city
beginning in august american privateers raided towns in nova scotia including saint john charlottetown and yarmouth
in john paul jones and jonathan eddy attacked canso and fort cumberland respectively
british officials in quebec began negotiating with the iroquois for their support while us envoys urged them to remain neutral
aware of native american leanings toward the british and fearing an anglo indian attack from canada congress authorized a second invasion in april
after defeat at the battle of quebec on december the americans maintained a loose blockade of the city until they retreated on may
a second defeat at trois rivires on june ended operations in quebec
british pursuit was initially blocked by american naval vessels on lake champlain until victory at valcour island on october forced the americans to withdraw to fort ticonderoga while in december an uprising in nova scotia sponsored by massachusetts was defeated at fort cumberland
these failures impacted public support for the patriot cause and aggressive anti loyalist policies in the new england colonies alienated the canadians
in virginia an attempt by governor lord dunmore to seize militia stores on april led to an increase in tension although conflict was avoided for the time being
this changed after the publication of dunmores proclamation on november promising freedom to any slaves who fled their patriot masters and agreed to fight for the crown
british forces were defeated at great bridge on december and took refuge on british ships anchored near the port of norfolk
when the third virginia convention refused to disband its militia or accept martial law dunmore ordered the burning of norfolk on january
the siege of savages old fields began on november in south carolina between loyalist and patriot militias and the loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony in the snow campaign
loyalists were recruited in north carolina to reassert british rule in the south but they were decisively defeated in the battle of moores creek bridge
a british expedition sent to reconquer south carolina launched an attack on charleston in the battle of sullivans island on june but it failed and left the south under patriot control until
a shortage of gunpowder led congress to authorize a naval expedition against the bahamas to secure ordnance stored there
on march an american squadron under the command of esek hopkins landed at the east end of nassau and encountered minimal resistance at fort montagu
hopkins troops then marched on fort nassau
hopkins had promised governor montfort browne and the civilian inhabitants of the area that their lives and property would not be in any danger if they offered no resistance to which they complied
hopkins captured large stores of powder and other munitions that was so great he had to impress an extra ship in the harbor to transport the supplies back home when he departed on march
a month later after a brief skirmish with they returned to new london connecticut the base for american naval operations during the revolution
after regrouping at halifax in nova scotia howe was determined to take the fight to the americans
he set sail for new york in june and began landing troops on staten island near the entrance to new york harbor on july
the americans rejected howes informal attempt to negotiate peace on july washington knew that an attack on the city was imminent and realized that he needed advance information to deal with disciplined british regular troops
on august patriot thomas knowlton was given orders to form an elite group for reconnaissance and secret missions
knowltons rangers which included nathan hale became the armys first intelligence unit
when washington was driven off long island he soon realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the british
he was committed to professionalizing military intelligence
with aid from benjamin tallmadge washington launched the six man culper spy ring
the efforts of washington and the culper spy ring substantially increased effective allocation and deployment of continental regiments in the field
over the course of the war washington spent more than percent of his total military funds on military intelligence operations
washington split the continental army into positions on manhattan and across the east river in western long island
on august at the battle of long island howe outflanked washington and forced him back to brooklyn heights but he did not attempt to encircle washingtons forces
through the night of august general henry knox bombarded the british
knowing they were up against overwhelming odds washington ordered the assembly of a war council on august all agreed to retreat to manhattan
washington quickly had his troops assembled and ferried them across the east river to manhattan on flat bottomed freight boats without any losses in men or ordnance leaving general thomas mifflins regiments as a rearguard
howe met with a delegation from the second continental congress at the september staten island peace conference but it failed to conclude peace largely because the british delegates only had authority to offer pardons and could not recognize independence
on september howe seized control of new york city when the british landed at kips bay and unsuccessfully engaged the americans at the battle of harlem heights the following day
on october howe failed to encircle the americans at the battle of pells point and the americans withdrew
howe declined to close with washingtons army on october at the battle of white plains and instead attacked a hill that was of no strategic value
washingtons retreat isolated his remaining forces and the british captured fort washington on november
the british victory there amounted to washingtons most disastrous defeat with the loss of prisoners
the remaining american regiments on long island fell back four days later
general henry clinton wanted to pursue washingtons disorganized army but he was first required to commit troops to capture newport rhode island to secure the loyalist port
general charles cornwallis pursued washington but howe ordered him to halt leaving washington unmolested
the outlook following the defeat at fort washington appeared bleak for the american cause
the reduced continental army had dwindled to fewer than men and was reduced further when enlistments expired at the end of the year
popular support wavered and morale declined
on december the continental congress abandoned the revolutionary capital of philadelphia and moved to baltimore where it remained for over two months until february
loyalist activity surged in the wake of the american defeat especially in new york state
in london news of the victorious long island campaign was well received with festivities held in the capital
public support reached a peak and king george iii awarded the order of the bath to howe
strategic deficiencies among patriot forces were evident washington divided a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one his inexperienced staff misread the military situation and american troops fled in the face of enemy fire
the successes led to predictions that the british could win within a year
in the meantime the british established winter quarters in the new york city area and anticipated renewed campaigning the following spring
two weeks after congress withdrew to baltimore on the night of december washington crossed the delaware river leading a column of continental army troops from todays bucks county pennsylvania located about miles upriver from philadelphia to todays mercer county new jersey in a logistically challenging and dangerous operation
meanwhile the hessians were involved with numerous clashes with small bands of patriots and were often aroused by false alarms at night in the weeks before the actual battle of trenton
by christmas they were tired and weary while a heavy snow storm led their commander colonel johann rall to assume no attack of any consequence would occur
at daybreak on the th the american patriots surprised and overwhelmed rall and his troops who lost over killed including rall while prisoners german cannons and much supply were captured
the battle of trenton restored the american armys morale reinvigorated the patriot cause and dispelled their fear of the what they regarded as hessian mercenaries
a british attempt to retake trenton was repulsed at assunpink creek on january during the night washington outmaneuvered cornwallis then defeated his rearguard in the battle of princeton the following day
the two victories helped convince the french that the americans were worthy military allies
after his success at princeton washington entered winter quarters at morristown new jersey where he remained until may and received congressional direction to inoculate all patriot troops against smallpox
with the exception of a minor skirmishing between the two armies which continued until march howe made no attempt to attack the americans
the campaign demonstrated that regaining new england would be a prolonged affair which led to a change in british strategy
this involved isolating the north from the rest of the country by taking control of the hudson river allowing them to focus on the south where loyalist support was believed to be substantial
in december howe wrote to the colonial secretary lord germain proposing a limited offensive against philadelphia while a second force moved down the hudson from canada
germain received this on february followed a few days later by a memorandum from burgoyne then in london on leave
burgoyne supplied several alternatives all of which gave him responsibility for the offensive with howe remaining on the defensive
the option selected required him to lead the main force south from montreal down the hudson valley while a detachment under barry st
leger moved east from lake ontario
the two would meet at albany leaving howe to decide whether to join them
reasonable in principle this did not account for the logistical difficulties involved and burgoyne erroneously assumed howe would remain on the defensive germains failure to make this clear meant he opted to attack philadelphia instead
burgoyne set out on june with a mixed force of british regulars professional german soldiers and canadian militia and captured fort ticonderoga on july
as general horatio gates retreated his troops blocked roads destroyed bridges dammed streams and stripped the area of food
this slowed burgoynes progress and forced him to send out large foraging expeditions on one of these more than british troops were captured at the battle of bennington on august
st leger moved east and besieged fort stanwix despite defeating an american relief force at the battle of oriskany on august he was abandoned by his indian allies and withdrew to quebec on august
now isolated and outnumbered by gates burgoyne continued onto albany rather than retreating to fort ticonderoga reaching saratoga on september
he asked clinton for support while constructing defenses around the town
morale among his troops rapidly declined and an unsuccessful attempt to break past gates at the battle of freeman farms on september resulted in british casualties
when clinton advised he could not reach them burgoynes subordinates advised retreat a reconnaissance in force on october was repulsed by gates at the battle of bemis heights forcing them back into saratoga with heavy losses
by october all hope of escape had vanished persistent rain reduced the camp to a squalid hell of mud and starving cattle supplies were dangerously low and many of the wounded in agony
burgoyne capitulated on october around soldiers including german forces commanded by general friedrich adolf riedesel surrendered their arms before being taken to boston where they were to be transported to england
after securing additional supplies howe made another attempt on philadelphia by landing his troops in chesapeake bay on august
he now compounded failure to support burgoyne by missing repeated opportunities to destroy his opponent defeating washington at the battle of brandywine on september then allowing him to withdraw in good order
after dispersing an american detachment at paoli on september cornwallis occupied philadelphia on september with the main force of under howe based just to the north at germantown
washington attacked them on october but was repulsed
to prevent howes forces in philadelphia being resupplied by sea the patriots erected fort mifflin and nearby fort mercer on the east and west banks of the delaware respectively and placed obstacles in the river south of the city
this was supported by a small flotilla of continental navy ships on the delaware supplemented by the pennsylvania state navy commanded by john hazelwood
an attempt by the royal navy to take the forts in the october to battle of red bank failed a second attack captured fort mifflin on november while fort mercer was abandoned two days later when cornwallis breached the walls
his supply lines secured howe tried to tempt washington into giving battle but after inconclusive skirmishing at the battle of white marsh from december to he withdrew to philadelphia for the winter
on december the americans followed suit and entered winter quarters at valley forge while washingtons domestic opponents contrasted his lack of battlefield success with gates victory at saratoga foreign observers such as frederick the great were equally impressed with germantown which demonstrated resilience and determination
over the winter poor conditions supply problems and low morale resulted in deaths with another unfit for duty due to lack of shoes
however baron friedrich wilhelm von steuben took the opportunity to introduce prussian army drill and infantry tactics to the entire continental army he did this by training model companies in each regiment who then instructed their home units
despite valley forge being only twenty miles away howe made no effort to attack their camp an action some critics argue could have ended the war
like his predecessors french foreign minister vergennes considered the peace a national humiliation and viewed the war as an opportunity to weaken britain
he initially avoided open conflict but allowed american ships to take on cargoes in french ports a technical violation of neutrality
although public opinion favored the american cause finance minister turgot argued they did not need french help to gain independence and war was too expensive
instead vergennes persuaded louis xvi to secretly fund a government front company to purchase munitions for the patriots carried in neutral dutch ships and imported through sint eustatius in the caribbean
many americans opposed a french alliance fearing to exchange one tyranny for another but this changed after a series of military setbacks in early
as france had nothing to gain from the colonies reconciling with britain congress had three choices making peace on british terms continuing the struggle on their own or proclaiming independence guaranteed by france
although the declaration of independence in july had wide public support adams was among those reluctant to pay the price of an alliance with france and over of congressmen voted against it
congress agreed to the treaty with reluctance and as the war moved in their favor increasingly lost interest in it
silas deane was sent to paris to begin negotiations with vergennes whose key objectives were replacing britain as the united states primary commercial and military partner while securing the french west indies from american expansion
these islands were extremely valuable in the value of sugar and coffee produced by saint domingue on its own exceeded that of all american exports combined
talks progressed slowly until october when british defeat at saratoga and their apparent willingness to negotiate peace convinced vergennes only a permanent alliance could prevent the disaster of anglo american rapprochement
assurances of formal french support allowed congress to reject the carlisle peace commission and insist on nothing short of complete independence
on february france and the united states signed the treaty of amity and commerce regulating trade between the two countries followed by a defensive military alliance against britain the treaty of alliance
in return for french guarantees of american independence congress undertook to defend their interests in the west indies while both sides agreed not to make a separate peace conflict over these provisions would lead to the to quasi war
charles iii of spain was invited to join on the same terms but refused largely due to concerns over the impact of the revolution on spanish colonies in the americas
spain had complained on multiple occasions about encroachment by american settlers into louisiana a problem that could only get worse once the united states replaced britain
although spain ultimately made important contributions to american success in the treaty of aranjuez charles agreed only to support frances war with britain outside america in return for help in recovering gibraltar menorca and spanish florida
the terms were confidential since several conflicted with american aims for example the french claimed exclusive control of the newfoundland cod fisheries a non negotiable for colonies like massachusetts
one less well known impact of this agreement was the abiding american distrust of foreign entanglements the us would not sign another treaty with france until their nato agreement of
this was because the us had agreed not to make peace without france while aranjuez committed france to keep fighting until spain recovered gibraltar effectively making it a condition of us independence without the knowledge of congress
to encourage french participation in the struggle for independence the us representative in paris silas deane promised promotion and command positions to any french officer who joined the continental army
such as gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette whom congress via dean appointed a major general on july
when the war started britain tried to borrow the dutch based scots brigade for service in america but pro patriot sentiment led the states general to refuse
although the republic was no longer a major power prior to they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits shipping french supplied munitions to the patriots
this ended when britain declared war in december a conflict that proved disastrous to the dutch economy
the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march to protect neutral shipping from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france
the british government failed to take into account the strength of the american merchant marine and support from european countries which allowed the colonies to import munitions and continue trading with relative impunity
while well aware of this the north administration delayed placing the royal navy on a war footing for cost reasons this prevented the institution of an effective blockade and restricted them to ineffectual diplomatic protests
traditional british policy was to employ european land based allies to divert the opposition a role filled by prussia in the seven years war in they were diplomatically isolated and faced war on multiple fronts
meanwhile george iii had given up on subduing america while britain had a european war to fight
he did not welcome war with france but he believed the british victories over france in the seven years war as a reason to believe in ultimate victory over france
britain could not find a powerful ally among the great powers to engage france on the european continent
britain subsequently changed its focus into the caribbean theater and diverted major military resources away from america
vergenness colleague stated for her honour france had to seize this opportunity to rise from her degradation
if she neglected it if fear overcame duty she would add debasement to humiliation and become an object of contempt to her own century and to all future peoples
at the end of howe resigned and was replaced by sir henry clinton on may with french entry into the war he was ordered to consolidate his forces in new york
on june the british departed philadelphia with the reinvigorated americans in pursuit the battle of monmouth on june was inconclusive but boosted patriot morale
washington had rallied charles lees broken regiments the continentals repulsed british bayonet charges the british rear guard lost perhaps per cent more casualties and the americans held the field at the end of the day
that midnight the newly installed clinton continued his retreat to new york
a french naval force under admiral charles henri hector destaing was sent to assist washington deciding new york was too formidable a target in august they launched a combined attack on newport with general john sullivan commanding land forces
the resulting battle of rhode island was indecisive badly damaged by a storm the french withdrew to avoid putting their ships at risk
further activity was limited to british raids on chestnut neck and little egg harbor in october
in july the americans captured british positions at stony point and paulus hook
clinton unsuccessfully tried to tempt washington into a decisive engagement by sending general william tryon to raid connecticut
in july a large american naval operation the penobscot expedition attempted to retake maine then part of massachusetts but was defeated
persistent iroquois raids along the border with quebec led to the punitive sullivan expedition in april destroying many settlements but failing to stop them
during the winter of the continental army suffered greater hardships than at valley forge
morale was poor public support fell away in the long war the continental dollar was virtually worthless the army was plagued with supply problems desertion was common and mutinies occurred in the pennsylvania line and new jersey line regiments over the conditions in early
in june clinton sent men under wilhelm von knyphausen to retake new jersey but they were halted by local militia at the battle of connecticut farms although the americans withdrew knyphausen felt he was not strong enough to engage washingtons main force and retreated
a second attempt two weeks later ended in a british defeat at the battle of springfield effectively ending their ambitions in new jersey
in july washington appointed benedict arnold commander of west point his attempt to betray the fort to the british failed due to incompetent planning and the plot was revealed when his british contact john andr was captured and later executed
arnold escaped to new york and switched sides an action justified in a pamphlet addressed to the inhabitants of america the patriots condemned his betrayal while he found himself almost as unpopular with the british
the southern strategy was developed by lord germain based on input from london based loyalists including joseph galloway
they argued that it made no sense to fight the patriots in the north where they were strongest while the new england economy was reliant on trade with britain regardless of who governed it
on the other hand duties on tobacco made the south far more profitable for britain while local support meant securing it required small numbers of regular troops
victory would leave a truncated united states facing british possessions in the south canada to the north and ohio on their western border with the atlantic seaboard controlled by the royal navy congress would be forced to agree to terms
however assumptions about the level of loyalist support proved wildly optimistic
germain accordingly ordered augustine prvost the british commander in east florida to advance into georgia in december
lieutenant colonel archibald campbell an experienced officer taken prisoner earlier in the war before being exchanged for ethan allen captured savannah on december
he recruited a loyalist militia of nearly many of whom allegedly joined only after campbell threatened to confiscate their property
poor motivation and training made them unreliable troops as demonstrated in their defeat by patriot militia at the battle of kettle creek on february although this was offset by british victory at brier creek on march
in june prvost launched an abortive assault on charleston before retreating to savannah an operation notorious for widespread looting by british troops that enraged both loyalists and patriots
in october a joint french and american operation under admiral destaing and general benjamin lincoln failed to recapture savannah
prvost was replaced by lord cornwallis who assumed responsibility for germains strategy he soon realized estimates of loyalist support were considerably over stated and he needed far larger numbers of regular forces
reinforced by clinton cornwallis troops captured charleston in may inflicting the most serious patriot defeat of the war over prisoners were taken and the continental army in the south effectively destroyed
on may lieutenant colonel banastre tarletons mainly loyalist force routed a continental army force nearly three times its size under the command of colonel abraham buford at the battle of waxhaws
the battle is controversial for allegations of a massacre which were later used as a recruiting tool by the patriots
clinton returned to new york leaving cornwallis to oversee the south despite their success the two men left barely on speaking terms with dire consequences for the future conduct of the war
the southern strategy depended on local support but this was undermined by a series of coercive measures
previously captured patriots were sent home after swearing not to take up arms against the king they were now required to fight their former comrades while the confiscation of patriot owned plantations led formerly neutral grandees to side with them
skirmishes at williamsons plantation cedar springs rocky mount and hanging rock signaled widespread resistance to the new oaths throughout south carolina
in july congress appointed general horatio gates commander in the south he was defeated at the battle of camden on august leaving cornwallis free to enter north carolina
despite battlefield success the british could not control the countryside and patriot attacks continued before moving north cornwallis sent loyalist militia under major patrick ferguson to cover his left flank leaving their forces too far apart to provide mutual support
in early october ferguson was defeated at the battle of kings mountain dispersing organized loyalist resistance in the region
despite this cornwallis continued into north carolina hoping for loyalist support while washington replaced gates with general nathanael greene in december
greene divided his army leading his main force southeast pursued by cornwallis a detachment was sent southwest under daniel morgan who defeated tarletons british legion at cowpens on january nearly eliminating it as a fighting force
the patriots now held the initiative in the south with the exception of a raid on richmond led by benedict arnold in january
greene led cornwallis on a series of countermarches around north carolina by early march the british were exhausted and short of supplies and greene felt strong enough to fight the battle of guilford court house on march
although victorious cornwallis suffered heavy casualties and retreated to wilmington north carolina seeking supplies and reinforcements
the patriots now controlled most of the carolinas and georgia outside the coastal areas after a minor reversal at the battle of hobkirks hill they recaptured fort watson and fort motte on april
on june brigadier general andrew pickens captured augusta leaving the british in georgia confined to charleston and savannah
the assumption loyalists would do most of the fighting left the british short of troops and battlefield victories came at the cost of losses they could not replace
despite halting greenes advance at the battle of eutaw springs on september cornwallis withdrew to charleston with little to show for his campaign
from the beginning of the war bernardo de glvez the governor of spanish louisiana allowed the americans to import supplies and munitions into new orleans then ship them to pittsburgh
this provided an alternative transportation route for the continental army bypassing the british blockade of the atlantic coast
the trade was organized by oliver pollock a successful merchant in havana and new orleans who was appointed us commercial agent
it also helped support the american campaign in the west in the illinois campaign militia under general george rogers clark
in february an expedition of militia to destroy british military supplies in settlements along the cuyahoga river was halted by adverse weather
later in the year a second campaign was undertaken to seize the illinois country from the british
virginia militia canadien settlers and indian allies commanded by colonel george rogers clark captured kaskaskia on july and then secured vincennes though vincennes was recaptured by quebec governor henry hamilton
in early the virginians counter attacked in the siege of fort vincennes and took hamilton prisoner
clark secured western british quebec as the american northwest territory in the treaty of paris brought the revolutionary war to an end
when spain joined frances war against britain in the anglo french war in their treaty specifically excluded spanish military action in north america
later that year however glvez initiated offensive operations against british outposts
first he cleared british garrisons in louisiana fort bute and natchez mississippi and captured five forts
in doing so glvez opened navigation on the mississippi river north to the american settlement in pittsburgh
on may british colonel henry bird invaded kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear american resistance from quebec to the gulf coast
their pensacola advance on new orleans was repelled by spanish governor glvezs offensive on mobile
simultaneous british attacks were repulsed on st
louis by the spanish lieutenant governor de leyba and on the virginia county courthouse in cahokia illinois by lieutenant colonel clark
the british initiative under bird from detroit was ended at the rumored approach of clark
the scale of violence in the licking river valley was extreme even for frontier standards
it led to english and german settlements who joined clarks militia when the british and their hired german soldiers withdrew to the great lakes
the americans responded with a major offensive along the mad river in august which met with some success in the battle of piqua but did not end indian raids
french soldier augustin de la balme led a canadian militia in an attempt to capture detroit but they dispersed when miami natives led by little turtle attacked the encamped settlers on november
the war in the west stalemated with the british garrison sitting in detroit and the virginians expanding westward settlements north of the ohio river in the face of british allied indian resistance
in galvez and pollock campaigned east along the gulf coast to secure west florida including british held mobile and pensacola
the spanish operations impaired the british supply of armaments to british indian allies which effectively suspended a military alliance to attack settlers between the mississippi river and the appalachian mountains
in large scale retaliations between settlers and native americans in the region included the gnadenhutten massacre and the crawford expedition
the battle of blue licks was one of the last major engagements of the american revolutionary war
news of the treaty between great britain and the united states arrived late that year
by this time about of kentucky settlers had been killed in battles against native americans contrasted with of the population killed in the thirteen colonies
lingering resentments led to continued fighting in the west after the war officially ended
clinton spent most of based in new york city he failed to construct a coherent operational strategy partly due to his difficult relationship with admiral marriot arbuthnot
in charleston cornwallis independently developed an aggressive plan for a campaign in virginia which he hoped would isolate greenes army in the carolinas and cause the collapse of patriot resistance in the south
this strategy was approved by lord germain in london but neither of them informed clinton
washington and rochambeau meanwhile discussed their options
washington wanted to attack the british in new york and rochambeau wanted to attack them in virginia where cornwallis forces were less established and arguably easier to defeat
washington eventually gave way and lafayette took a combined franco american force into virginia but clinton misinterpreted his movements as preparations for an attack on new york
concerned by a perceived threat to his positions in new york he instructed cornwallis to establish a fortified sea base where the royal navy could evacuate british troops to help defend new york
when lafayette entered virginia cornwallis complied with clintons orders and withdrew to yorktown where he constructed strong defenses and awaited evacuation
an agreement by the spanish navy to defend the french west indies allowed admiral de grasse to relocate to the atlantic seaboard a move arbuthnot did not anticipate
this provided lafayette naval support while the failure of previous combined operations at newport and savannah meant their coordination was planned more carefully
despite repeated urging from his subordinates cornwallis made no attempt to engage lafayette before he could establish siege lines
expecting to be withdrawn within a few days he also abandoned the outer defenses which were promptly occupied by the besiegers and hastened british defeat
on august a royal navy fleet under thomas graves left new york for yorktown
after landing troops and munitions for the besiegers on august de grasse remained in chesapeake bay and intercepted him on september although the battle of the chesapeake was indecisive in terms of losses graves was forced to retreat leaving cornwallis isolated
an attempted breakout over york river at gloucester point failed due to bad weather
under heavy bombardment with dwindling supplies cornwallis felt his situation was hopeless and on october sent emissaries to general washington to negotiate their surrender after twelve hours of negotiations the terms of surrender were finalized the following day
responsibility for defeat was the subject of fierce public debate between cornwallis clinton and germain
despite criticism from his junior officers cornwallis retained the confidence of his peers and later held a series of senior government positions
clinton ultimately took most of the blame and spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity
subsequent to yorktown american forces were assigned to supervise the armistice between washington and clinton made to facilitate british departure following the january law of parliament forbidding any further british offensive action in north america
british american negotiations in paris led to signed preliminary agreements in november which acknowledged us independence
the enacted congressional war objective a british to withdraw from north america and cede these regions to the us was completed in stages in east coast cities
in the us south generals greene and wayne loosely invested the withdrawing british at savannah and charleston where they observed the british remove their troops from charleston on december
loyalist provincial militias of whites and free blacks and loyalists with slaves were transported to nova scotia and the british west indies
native american allies of the british and some freed blacks were left to escape unaided through the american lines
washington moved his army to new windsor on the hudson river about sixty miles north of new york city and there the substance of the continental army was furloughed home with officers at half pay until the treaty of paris formally ended the war on september
at that time congress decommissioned the regiments of washingtons continental army and began issuing land grants to veterans in the northwest territories for their war service
the last british occupation of new york city ended on november with the departure of clintons replacement general sir guy carleton
to win their insurrection washington and the continental army needed to outlast the british will to continue the fight
to restore their british america empire the british had to defeat the continental army in the early months and compel second continental congress in philadelphia to dissolve and retract its claim to self governance
historian terry m
mays of the citadel identifies three separate types of warfare during the revolutionary war
the first was a colonial conflict in which objections to imperial trade regulation were as significant as taxation policy
the second was a civil war with all thirteen colonies split between american patriots american loyalists and those who preferred to remain neutral in the revolution and war
particularly in the south many battles were fought between patriots and loyalists with no british involvement leading to divisions that continued after independence was achieved
the third element was a global war between france spain the dutch republic and britain with america serving as one of several different war theaters
after entering the revolutionary war in france provided the americans money weapons soldiers and naval assistance while french troops fought under us command in north america
while spain did not formally join the war in america they provided access to the mississippi river and captured british possessions on the gulf of mexico that denied bases to the royal navy retook menorca and besieged gibraltar in europe
although the dutch republic was no longer a major power prior to they still dominated the european carrying trade and dutch merchants made large profits by shipping french supplied munitions to the patriots
this ended when britain declared war in december and the conflict proved disastrous to dutch economy
the dutch were also excluded from the first league of armed neutrality formed by russia sweden and denmark in march that protected neutral ships from being stopped and searched for contraband by britain and france
while of limited effect these interventions forced the british to divert men and resources away from north america
the second continental congress meeting in philadelphia stood to benefit if the american revolution evolved into a protracted war
their thirteen colonial state populations were largely prosperous and depended on local production for food and supplies rather than on imports from britain which took six to twelve weeks to arrive by cross atlantic shipping
the thirteen colonies were spread across most of north american atlantic seaboard stretching miles
most colonial farms were remote from the seaports and control of four or five major ports did not give britain control over american inland areas
each state had established internal distribution systems
each of the thirteen colonies also had a long established system of local militia which were combat tested in support of british regulars thirteen years before to secure an expanded british empire
together these milias denied frances claims to north america west of the mississippi river in the french and indian war
the thirteen colonial state legislatures independently funded and controlled their local militias
in the american revolution they trained and provided continental line regiments to the regular army each with their own state officer corps
motivation was also a major asset each colonial capital had its own newspapers and printers and the patriots enjoyed more popular support than the loyalists
britain hoped that the loyalists would do much of the fighting but found that the loyalists did not engage as significantly as they had hoped
when the revolutionary war began the second continental congress lacked a professional army or navy but each colony maintained local militias
militiamen were lightly armed had little training and usually did not have uniforms
their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time and lacked the training and discipline of more experienced soldiers
local county militias were reluctant to travel far from home and they were unavailable for extended operations
to compensate for this the continental congress established a regular force known as the continental army on june which proved to be the origin of the modern united states army and appointed washington as its commander in chief
however it suffered significantly from the lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants offset by a few senior officers
each state legislature appointed officers for both county and state militias and their regimental continental line officers although washington was required to accept congressional appointments he was still permitted to choose and command his own generals such as nathanael greene his chief of artillery henry knox and alexander hamilton the chief of staff
one of washingtons most successful general officer recruits was baron friedrich wilhelm von steuben a veteran of the prussian general staff who wrote the revolutionary war drill manual
the development of the continental army was always a work in progress and washington used both his regulars and state militias throughout the war when properly employed the combination allowed them to overwhelm smaller british forces as they did in battles at concord boston bennington and saratoga
both sides used partisan warfare but the state militias effectively suppressed loyalist activity when british regulars were not in the area
washington designed the overall military strategy of the revolutionary war in cooperation with congress established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs personally recruited his senior officer corps and kept the states focused on a common goal
for the first three years until after fall of philadelphia and the six month encampment at valley forge the continental army was largely supplemented by local state militias
washington initially employed the inexperienced officers and untrained troops in fabian strategies rather than risk frontal assaults against britains professional soldiers and officers
over the course of the entire war washington lost more battles than he won but he never surrendered his troops and maintained a fighting force in the face of british field armies and never gave up fighting for the american cause
by prevailing european standards the armies in america were relatively small limited by lack of supplies and logistics
the british were constrained by the logistical difficulty of transporting troops across the atlantic and their dependence on local supplies
throughout the war washington never directly commanded more than men and the combined franco american army in the decisive american victory at yorktown was only about
at the beginning of patriot forces consisted of men with two thirds of them in the continental army and the other third in the various state militias
about american men served as regulars or as militia for the revolutionary cause over eight years during wartime but there were never more than men under arms at any time
on the whole american officers never equaled their british opponents in tactics and maneuvers and they lost most of the pitched battles
the great successes at boston saratoga and yorktown were won by trapping the british far from base with a greater number of troops
after however washingtons army was transformed into a more disciplined and effective force mostly as a product of baron von steubens military training
immediately after the continental army emerged from valley forge in june it proved its ability to match the military capabilities of the british at the battle of monmouth including a black rhode island regiment fending off a british bayonet attack and then counter charging the british for the first time as part of washingtons army
after the battle of monmouth washington came to realize that saving entire towns was not necessary but preserving his army and keeping the revolutionary spirit alive was more important
washington informed henry laurens then president of the second continental congress that the possession of our towns while we have an army in the field will avail them little
although the continental congress was responsible for the war effort and provided supplies to the troops washington took it upon himself to pressure congress and the state legislatures to provide the essentials of war there was never nearly enough
congress evolved in its committee oversight and established the board of war which included members of the military
because the board of war was also a committee ensnared with its own internal procedures congress also created the post of secretary of war appointing major general benjamin lincoln to the position in february
washington worked closely with lincoln to coordinate civilian and military authorities and took charge of training and supplying the army
during the first summer of the war washington began outfitting schooners and other small seagoing vessels to prey on ships supplying the british in boston
the second continental congress established the continental navy on october and appointed esek hopkins as its first commander for most of the war the continental navy included only a handful of small frigates and sloops supported by numerous privateers
on november congress authorized the creation of the continental marines which ultimately evolved into and was named the united states marine corps
john paul jones became the first american naval hero when he captured the hms drake on april the first victory for any american military vessel in british waters
the last such victory was by the frigate uss alliance commanded by captain john barry
on march the alliance outgunned hms sybil in a minute duel while escorting spanish gold from havana to the congress in philadelphia
after yorktown all us navy ships were sold or given away it was the first time in americas history that it had no fighting forces on the high seas
congress primarily commissioned privateers to reduce costs and to take advantage of the large proportion of colonial sailors found in the british empire
in total they included ships that successfully captured enemy ships to damage the british effort and to enrich themselves with the proceeds from the sale of cargo and the ship itself
about sailors served aboard american privateers during the war
at the beginning of the revolutionary war the americans had no major international allies since most nation states watched and waited to see how developments unfolded in the conflict in british america
over time the continental army established its military credibility defeating or holding their own against british regulars and their hired hessians known to all european great powers
battles such as the battle of bennington the battles of saratoga and even defeats such as the battle of germantown proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful european nations including france spain and the dutch republic the dutch impressed by these american victories and conflicts moved from covertly supplying the americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them
the decisive american victory at saratoga convinced france which was already a long time rival of britain to offer the americans the treaty of amity and commerce
the two nations also agreed to a defensive treaty of alliance to protect their trade and also guaranteed american independence from britain
to engage the united states as a french ally militarily the treaty was conditioned on britain initiating a war on france to stop it from trading with the us spain and the dutch republic were invited to join by both france and the united states in the treaty but neither was responsive to the request
on june france declared war on great britain and it invoked the french military alliance with the us which ensured additional us private support for french possessions in the caribbean
washington worked closely with the soldiers and navy that france would send to america primarily through lafayette on his staff
french assistance made critical contributions required to defeat general charles cornwallis at yorktown in
the british military had considerable experience of fighting in north america most recently during the seven years war which forced france to give up new france in
however in previous conflicts they benefited from local logistics as well as support from the colonial militia which was not available in the american revolutionary war
reinforcements had to come from europe and maintaining large armies over such distances was extremely complex ships could take three months to cross the atlantic and orders from london were often outdated by the time they arrived
prior to the conflict the colonies were largely autonomous economic and political entities with no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance
this meant that unlike europe where the fall of a capital city often ended wars that in america continued even after the loss of major settlements such as philadelphia the seat of congress new york and charleston
british power was reliant on the royal navy whose dominance allowed them to resupply their own expeditionary forces while preventing access to enemy ports
however the majority of the american population was agrarian rather than urban supported by the french navy and blockade runners based in the dutch caribbean their economy was able to survive
the geographical size of the colonies and limited manpower meant the british could not simultaneously conduct military operations and occupy territory without local support
debate persists over whether their defeat was inevitable one british statesman described it as like trying to conquer a map
while ferling argues patriot victory was nothing short of a miracle ellis suggests the odds always favored the americans especially after howe squandered the chance of a decisive british success in an opportunity that would never come again
the us military history speculates the additional commitment of fresh troops in would have placed british victory within the realm of possibility
the expulsion of france from north america in led to a drastic reduction in british troop levels in the colonies in there were only regular soldiers among a civilian population of million
the bulk of military resources in the americas were focused on defending sugar islands in the caribbean jamaica alone generated more revenue than all thirteen american colonies combined
with the end of the seven years war the permanent army in britain was also cut back which resulted in administrative difficulties when the war began a decade later
over the course of the war there were four separate british commanders in chief
the first was thomas gage appointed in whose initial focus was establishing british rule in former french areas of canada
rightly or wrongly many in london blamed the revolt on his failure to take firm action earlier and he was relieved after the heavy losses incurred at the battle of bunker hill in charlestown massachusetts
his replacement was sir william howe a member of the whig faction in parliament who opposed the policy of coercion advocated by lord north cornwallis who later surrendered at yorktown was one of many senior officers who initially refused to serve in north america
the campaign showed the british overestimated the capabilities of their own troops and underestimated the colonial militia requiring a reassessment of tactics and strategy
however it allowed the patriots to take the initiative and british authorities rapidly lost control over every colony
howes responsibility is still debated despite receiving large numbers of reinforcements bunker hill seems to have permanently affected his self confidence and lack of tactical flexibility meant he often failed to follow up opportunities
many of his decisions were attributed to supply problems such as the delay in launching the new york campaign and failure to pursue washingtons beaten army
having lost the confidence of his subordinates he was recalled after burgoyne surrendered at saratoga
following the failure of the carlisle commission british policy changed from treating the patriots as subjects who needed to be reconciled to enemies who had to be defeated
in howe was replaced by sir henry clinton appointed instead of carleton who was considered overly cautious
regarded as an expert on tactics and strategy like his predecessors clinton was handicapped by chronic supply issues
as a result he was largely inactive in and much of in october he warned germain of fatal consequences if matters did not improve
in addition clintons strategy was compromised by conflict with political superiors in london and his colleagues in north america especially admiral mariot arbuthnot replaced in early by rodney
he was neither notified nor consulted when germain approved cornwallis invasion of the south in and delayed sending him reinforcements believing the bulk of washingtons army was still outside new york city
after the surrender at yorktown clinton was relieved by carleton whose major task was to oversee the evacuation of loyalists and british troops from savannah charleston and new york city
during the th century states commonly hired foreign soldiers including britain
during the seven years war foreign soldiers comprised of the british army and their use caused little debate
when it became clear additional troops were needed to suppress the revolt in america it was decided to employ professional german soldiers
there were several reasons for this including public sympathy for the patriot cause an historical reluctance to expand the british army and the time needed to recruit and train new regiments
an alternate source was readily available in the holy roman empire where many smaller states had a long tradition of renting their armies to the highest bidder
the most important was hesse kassel known as the mercenary state
the first supply agreements were signed by the north administration in late over the next decade more than germans fought in north america gibraltar south africa and india of whom served in the american war
often generically referred to as hessians they included men from many other states including hanover and brunswick
sir henry clinton recommended recruiting russian troops whom he rated very highly having seen them in action against the ottomans however negotiations with catherine the great made little progress
unlike previous wars their use led to intense political debate in britain france and even germany where frederick the great refused to provide passage through his territories for troops hired for the american war
in march the agreements were challenged in parliament by whigs who objected to coercion in general and the use of foreign soldiers to subdue british subjects
the debates were covered in detail by american newspapers which reprinted key speeches and in may they received copies of the treaties themselves
provided by british sympathizers these were smuggled into north america from london by george merchant a recently released american prisoner
the prospect of foreign german soldiers being used in the colonies bolstered support for independence more so than taxation and other acts combined the king was accused of declaring war on his own subjects leading to the idea there were now two separate governments
by apparently showing britain was determined to go to war it made hopes of reconciliation seem naive and hopeless while the employment of what was regarded as foreign mercenaries became one of the charges levelled against george iii in the declaration of independence
the hessian reputation within germany for brutality also increased support for the patriot cause among german american immigrants
the presence of over german americans meant both sides felt the german soldiers might be persuaded to desert one reason clinton suggested employing russians was that he felt they were less likely to defect
when the first german troops arrived on staten island in august congress approved the printing of handbills promising land and citizenship to any willing to join the patriot cause
the british launched a counter campaign claiming deserters could well be executed for meddling in a war that was not theirs
desertion among the germans occurred throughout the war with the highest rate of desertion occurring during the time between the surrender at yorktown and the treaty of paris
german regiments were central to the british war effort of the estimated sent to america some became casualties
wealthy loyalists convinced the british government that most of the colonists were sympathetic toward the crown consequently british military planners relied on recruiting loyalists but had trouble recruiting sufficient numbers as the patriots had widespread support
nevertheless they continued to deceive themselves on their level of american support as late as a year before hostilities ended
approximately loyalists fought for the british throughout the war
although loyalists constituted about twenty percent of the colonial population they were concentrated in distinct communities
many of them lived among large plantation owners in the tidewater region and south carolina who produced cash crops in tobacco and indigo comparable to global markets in caribbean sugar
when the british began probing the backcountry in they were faced with a major problem any significant level of organized loyalist activity required a continued presence of british regulars
the available manpower that the british had in america was insufficient to protect loyalist territory and counter american offensives
the loyalist militias in the south were constantly defeated by neighboring patriot militia
the most critical combat between the two partisan militias was at the battle of kings mountain the patriot victory irreversibly impaired any further loyalist militia capability in the south
when the early war policy was administered by general william howe the crowns need to maintain loyalist support prevented it from using the traditional revolt suppression methods
the british cause suffered when their troops ransacked local homes during an aborted attack on charleston in that enraged both patriots and loyalists
after congress rejected the carlisle peace commission in and westminster turned to hard war during clintons command neutral colonists in the carolinas often allied with the patriots whenever brutal combat broke out between tories and whigs
conversely loyalists gained support when patriots intimidated suspected tories by destroying property or tarring and feathering
a loyalist militia unit the british legion provided some of the best troops in british service it received a commission in the british army
it was a mixed regiment of dragoons and infantry supported by batteries of flying artillery
it was commanded by banastre tarleton and gained a fearsome reputation in the colonies for brutality and needless slaughterin may the british legion was one of five regiments that formed the american establishment
women played various roles during the revolutionary war they often accompanied their husbands when permitted to do so
for example throughout the war martha washington was known to visit and provide aid to her husband george at various american camps and frederika charlotte riedesel documented the saratoga campaign
women often accompanied armies as camp followers to sell goods and perform necessary tasks in hospitals and camps
they were a necessary part of eighteenth century armies and numbered in the thousands during the war
women also assumed military roles aside from military tasks like treating the wounded or setting up camp some dressed as men to directly support combat fight or act as spies on both sides of the revolutionary war
anna maria lane joined her husband in the army and wore mens clothes by the time the battle of germantown happened
the virginia general assembly later cited her bravery she fought while dressed as a man and performed extraordinary military services and received a severe wound at the battle of germantown
with the courage of a soldier
on april sybil ludington is said to have ridden to alert militia forces of putnam county new york and danbury connecticut to warn them of the britishs approach she has been called the female paul revere
a report in the new england quarterly says there is little evidence backing the story and whether the ride occurred is questioned
a few others disguised themselves as men
deborah sampson fought until her gender was discovered and discharged as a result sally st
clair was killed in action during the war
when war began the population of the thirteen colonies included an estimated slaves predominantly used as labor on southern plantations
in november lord dunmore the royal governor of virginia issued a proclamation that promised freedom to any patriot owned slaves willing to bear arms
although the announcement helped to fill a temporary manpower shortage white loyalist prejudice meant recruits were eventually redirected to non combatant roles
the loyalists motive was to deprive patriot planters of labor rather than to end slavery loyalist owned slaves were returned
the philipsburg proclamation issued by clinton extended the offer of freedom to patriot owned slaves throughout the colonies
it persuaded entire families to escape to british lines many of which were employed on farms to grow food for the army by removing the requirement for military service
while clinton organized the black pioneers he also ensured fugitive slaves were returned to loyalist owners with orders that they were not to be punished for their attempted escape
as the war progressed service as regular soldiers in british units became increasingly common black loyalists formed two regiments of the charleston garrison in
estimates of the numbers who served the british during the war vary from to excluding those who escaped during wartime
thomas jefferson estimated that virginia may have lost slaves in total escapes
in south carolina nearly slaves either fled migrated or died which significantly disrupted the plantation economies both during and after the war
black patriots were barred from the continental army until washington convinced congress in january that there was no other way to replace losses from disease and desertion
the st rhode island regiment formed in february included former slaves whose owners were compensated however only of its soldiers were black and recruitment stopped in june
ultimately around african americans served in the continental army and navy in a variety of roles while another were employed in patriot militia units aboard privateers or as teamsters servants and spies
after the war a small minority received land grants or congressional pensions in old age many others were returned to their masters post war despite earlier promises of freedom
as a patriot victory became increasingly likely the treatment of black loyalists became a point of contention after the surrender of yorktown in washington insisted all escapees be returned but cornwallis refused
in and around to freed blacks were evacuated by the british from charleston savannah and new york some moved onto london while to settled in nova scotia where they founded settlements such as birchtown
white loyalists transported enslaved blacks to jamaica and the bahamas
the free black loyalists who migrated to the british west indies included regular soldiers from dunmores ethiopian regiment and those from charleston who helped garrison the leeward islands
most native americans east of the mississippi river were affected by the war and many tribes were divided over how to respond to the conflict
a few tribes were friendly with the colonists but most natives opposed the union of the colonies as a potential threat to their territory
approximately natives fought on the british side with the largest group coming from the iroquois tribes who deployed around men
early in july cherokee allies of britain attacked the short lived washington district of north carolina
their defeat splintered both cherokee settlements and people and was directly responsible for the rise of the chickamauga cherokee who perpetuated the cherokee american wars against american settlers for decades after hostilities with britain ended
creek and seminole allies of britain fought against americans in georgia and south carolina
in a force of creeks destroyed american settlements along the broad river in georgia
creek warriors also joined thomas browns raids into south carolina and assisted britain during the siege of savannah
many native americans were involved in the fight between britain and spain on the gulf coast and along the british side of the mississippi river
thousands of creeks chickasaws and choctaws fought in major battles such as the battle of fort charlotte the battle of mobile and the siege of pensacola
the iroquois confederacy was shattered as a result of the american revolutionary war whatever side they took the seneca onondaga and cayuga tribes sided with the british members of the mohawks fought on both sides and many tuscarora and oneida sided with the americans
to retaliate against raids on american settlement by loyalists and their indian allies the continental army dispatched the sullivan expedition on a punitive expedition throughout new york to debilitate the iroquois tribes that had sided with the british
mohawk leaders joseph louis cook and joseph brant sided with the americans and the british respectively which further exacerbated the split
in the western theater of the american revolutionary war conflicts between settlers and native americans led to lingering distrust
in the treaty of paris great britain ceded control of the disputed lands between the great lakes and the ohio river but the indian inhabitants were not a part of the peace negotiations
tribes in the northwest territory joined as the western confederacy and allied with the british to resist american settlement and their conflict continued after the revolutionary war as the northwest indian war
lord north prime minister since delegated control of the war in north america to lord george germain and the earl of sandwich who was head of the royal navy from to
defeat at saratoga in made it clear the revolt would not be easily suppressed especially after the franco american alliance of february and french declaration of war in june
with spain also expected to join the conflict the royal navy needed to prioritize either the war in america or in europe germain advocated the former sandwich the latter
british negotiators now proposed a second peace settlement to congress
the terms presented by the carlisle peace commission included acceptance of the principle of self government
parliament would recognize congress as the governing body suspend any objectionable legislation surrender its right to local colonial taxation and discuss including american representatives in the house of commons
in return all property confiscated from loyalists would be returned british debts honored and locally enforced martial law accepted
however congress demanded either immediate recognition of independence or the withdrawal of all british troops they knew the commission were not authorized to accept these bringing negotiations to a rapid end
when the commissioners returned to london in november they recommended a change in policy
sir henry clinton the new british commander in chief in america was ordered to stop treating the rebels as enemies rather than subjects whose loyalty might be regained
those standing orders would be in effect for three years until clinton was relieved
north initially backed the southern strategy attempting to exploit divisions between the mercantile north and slave owning south but after the defeat of yorktown he was forced to accept the fact that this policy had failed
it was clear the war was lost although the royal navy forced the french to relocate their fleet to the caribbean in november and resumed a close blockade of american trade
the resulting economic damage and rising inflation meant the us was now eager to end the war while france was unable to provide further loans congress could no longer pay its soldiers
on february a whig motion to end the offensive war in america was carried by votes
north now resigned obliging the king to invite lord rockingham to form a government a consistent supporter of the patriot cause he made a commitment to us independence a condition of doing so
george iii reluctantly accepted and the new government took office on march however rockingham died unexpectedly on july and was replaced by lord shelburne who acknowledged american independence
when lord rockingham the whig leader and friend of the american cause was elevated to prime minister congress consolidated its diplomatic consuls in europe into a peace delegation at paris
all were experienced in congressional leadership
the dean of the delegation was benjamin franklin of pennsylvania
he had become a celebrity in the french court but he was also an enlightenment scientist with influence in the courts of european great powers in prussia englands former ally and austria a catholic empire like spain
since the s franklin had been an organizer of british american inter colony cooperation and then served as a colonial lobbyist to parliament in london
john adams of massachusetts had been consul to the dutch republic and was a prominent early new england patriot
john jay of new york had been consul to spain and was a past president of the continental congress
as consul to the dutch republic henry laurens of south carolina had secured a preliminary agreement for a trade agreement
he had been a successor to john jay as president of congress and with franklin was a member of the american philosophical society
although active in the preliminaries he was not a signer of the conclusive treaty
the whig negotiators for lord rockingham and his successor prime minister lord shelburne included long time friend of benjamin franklin from his time in london david hartley and richard oswald who had negotiated laurens release from the tower of london
the preliminary peace signed on november met four key congressional demands independence territory up to the mississippi navigation rights into the gulf of mexico and fishing rights in newfoundland
british strategy was to strengthen the us sufficiently to prevent france from regaining a foothold in north america and they had little interest in these proposals
however divisions between their opponents allowed them to negotiate separately with each to improve their overall position starting with the american delegation in september
the french and spanish sought to improve their position by creating the us dependent on them for support against britain thus reversing the losses of
both parties tried to negotiate a settlement with britain excluding the americans france proposed setting the western boundary of the us along the appalachians matching the british proclamation line
the spanish suggested additional concessions in the vital mississippi river basin but required the cession of georgia in violation of the franco american alliance
facing difficulties with spain over claims involving the mississippi river and from france who was still reluctant to agree to american independence until all her demands were met john jay promptly told the british that he was willing to negotiate directly with them cutting off france and spain and prime minister lord shelburne in charge of the british negotiations agreed
key agreements for the united states in obtaining peace included recognition of united states independence including recognition that the us would gain all of the area east of the mississippi river north of florida and south of canada and the granting of fishing rights in the grand banks off the coast of newfoundland and in the gulf of saint lawrence the united states and great britain were each given perpetual access to the mississippi river
an anglo american preliminary peace was formally entered into in november and congress endorsed the settlement on april
it announced the achievement of peace with independence and the conclusive treaty was signed on september in paris effective the following day on september when britain signed its treaty with france
john adams who helped draft the treaty claimed it represented one of the most important political events that ever happened on the globe
ratified respectively by congress and parliament the final versions were exchanged in paris the following spring
on november the last british troops remaining in the us were evacuated from new york to halifax
washington expressed astonishment that the americans had won a war against a leading world power referring to the american victory as little short of a standing miracle
the conflict between british subjects with the crown against those with the congress had lasted over eight years from to
the last uniformed british troops departed their last east coast port cities in savannah charleston and new york city by november which marked the end of british occupation in the new united states
on april washington issued orders that he had long waited to give that all acts of hostility were to cease immediately
that same day by arrangement with washington general guy carleton issued a similar order to british troops
british troops however were not to evacuate until a prisoner of war exchange occurred an effort that involved much negotiation and would take some seven months to effect
as directed by a congressional resolution of may all non commissioned officers and enlisted were furloughed to their homes until the definitive treaty of peace when they would be automatically discharged
the us armies were directly disbanded in the field as of washingtons general orders on monday june
once the treaty of paris was signed with britain on september washington resigned as commander in chief of the continental army and left to retire at mount vernon
the expanse of territory that was now the united states was ceded from its colonial mother country alone
it included millions of sparsely settled acres south of the great lakes line between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river much of which was part of canada
the tentative colonial migration west became a flood during the years of the revolutionary war
kentucky county virginia for instance had a population of
by years later its population had grown to over
britains extended post war policy for the us continued to try to establish an indian buffer state below the great lakes as late as during the war of
the formally acquired western american lands continued to be populated by a dozen or so american indian tribes that had been british allies for the most part
though british forts on their lands had been ceded to either the french or the british prior to the creation of the united states natives were not referred to in the british cession to the us while tribes were not consulted by the british for the treaty in practice the british refused to abandon the forts on territory they formally transferred
instead they provisioned military allies for continuing frontier raids and sponsored the northwest indian war including erecting an additional british fort miami in maumee ohio
british sponsorship of local warfare on the us continued until the anglo american jay treaty authored by alexander hamilton went into effect on february
at the same time the spanish also sponsored war within the us by indian proxies in its southwest territory ceded by france to britain then britain to the americans
of the european powers with american colonies adjacent to the newly created united states spain was most threatened by american independence and it was correspondingly the most hostile to it
its territory adjacent to the us was relatively undefended so spanish policy developed a combination of initiatives
spanish soft power diplomatically challenged the british territorial cession west to the mississippi river and the previous northern boundaries of spanish florida
it imposed a high tariff on american goods then blocked american settler access to the port of new orleans
spanish hard power extended war alliances and arms to southwestern natives to resist american settlement
a former continental army general james wilkinson settled in kentucky county virginia in and there he fostered settler secession from virginia during the spanish allied chickamauga cherokee war
beginning in he received pay as spanish agent and subsequently expanded his efforts to persuade american settlers west of the appalachian mountains to secede from the united states first in the washington administration and later again in the jefferson administration
the total loss of life throughout the conflict is largely unknown
as was typical in wars of the era diseases such as smallpox claimed more lives than battle
between and a smallpox epidemic broke out throughout north america killing an estimated among all its populations during those years
historian joseph ellis suggests that washingtons decision to have his troops inoculated against the disease was one of his most important decisions
up to american patriots died during active military service
of these approximately were killed in battle while at least died from disease
the majority of the latter died while prisoners of war of the british mostly in the prison ships in new york harbor
the number of patriots seriously wounded or disabled by the war has been estimated from to
the french suffered killed in combat in the united states
the spanish lost a total of killed and wounded in west florida
a british report in puts their total army deaths at in north america
approximately germans died in british service in addition to deserters among those labeled german deserters however it is estimated that were killed in combat
the american revolution established the united states with its numerous civil liberties and set an example to overthrow both monarchy and colonial governments
the united states has the worlds oldest written constitution and the constitutions of other free countries often bear a striking resemblance to the us constitution often word for word in places
it inspired revolutions in france haiti latin america and elsewhere in the modern era
although the revolution eliminated many forms of inequality it did little to change the status of women despite the role they played in winning independence
most significantly it failed to end slavery which continued to be a serious social and political issue and caused divisions that would ultimately end in civil war
while many were uneasy over the contradiction of demanding liberty for some yet denying it to others the dependence of southern states on slave labor made abolition too great a challenge
between and many of the states banned the importation of slaves but the institution itself continued
in virginia passed a law permitting manumission and over the next eight years more than slaves were given their freedom
with support from benjamin franklin in the quakers petitioned congress to abolish slavery the number of abolitionist movements greatly increased and by all the northern states had outlawed it
however even many like adams who viewed slavery as a foul contagion opposed the petition as a threat to the union
in jefferson passed legislation banning the importation of slaves but allowed the domestic slave trade to continue arguing the federal government had no right to regulate individual states
the body of historical writings on the american revolution cite many motivations for the patriot revolt that ultimately led to the nations independence and establishment
american patriots stressed the denial of their constitutional rights as englishmen especially no taxation without representation
contemporaries credit the american enlightenment with laying the intellectual moral and ethical foundations for the american revolution among the founding fathers who were influenced by the classical liberalism of john locke and other enlightenment age writers and philosophers
two treatises of government has long been cited as a major influence on revolutionary era american thinking but historians david lundberg and henry f
may contend that lockes essay concerning human understanding was far more widely read than were his political treatises
historians since the s have emphasized that the patriot constitutional argument was made possible by the emergence of a sense of american nationalism that united the colonies
in turn that nationalism was rooted in a republican value system that demanded consent of the governed and deeply opposed aristocratic control
in britain on the other hand republicanism was largely a fringe ideology since it challenged the aristocratic control of the british monarchy and political system
political power was not controlled by an aristocracy or nobility in the colonies instead the colonial political system was based on the winners of free elections which were open at the time to the majority of white men
in analysis of the revolution historians in recent decades have often cited three motivations behind it after the first us postage stamp was issued in the us postal service frequently issued commemorative stamps celebrating the various people and events of the revolutionary war

the ampere often shortened to amp is the unit of electric current in the international system of units
one ampere is equal to coulomb or electrons worth of charge moving past a point in a second
it is named after french mathematician and physicist andr marie ampre considered the father of electromagnetism along with danish physicist hans christian rsted
as of the redefinition of the si base units the ampere is defined by fixing the elementary charge to be exactly c which means an ampere is an electric current equivalent to elementary charges moving every seconds or elementary charges moving in a second
prior to the redefinition the ampere was defined as the current passing through parallel wires metre apart that produces a magnetic force of newtons per metre
the earlier cgs system has two units of current one structured similar to the sis and the other using coulombs law as a fundamental relationship with the unit of charge defined by measuring the force between two charged metal plates
the unit of current is then defined as one unit of charge per second
in si the unit of charge the coulomb is defined as the charge carried by one ampere during one second
the ampere is named for french physicist and mathematician andr marie ampre who studied electromagnetism and laid the foundation of electrodynamics
in recognition of ampres contributions to the creation of modern electrical science an international convention signed at the international exposition of electricity established the ampere as a standard unit of electrical measurement for electric current
the ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the unit of electric current in the centimetre gram second system of units
that unit now known as the abampere was defined as the amount of current that generates a force of two dynes per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart
the size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the mksa system would be conveniently sized
the international ampere was an early realization of the ampere defined as the current that would deposit of silver per second from a silver nitrate solution
later more accurate measurements revealed that this current is
since power is defined as the product of current and voltage the ampere can alternatively be expressed in terms of the other units using the relationship and thus a w v
current can be measured by a multimeter a device that can measure electrical voltage current and resistance
the ampere is that constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length of negligible circular cross section and placed one metre apart in vacuum would produce between these conductors a force equal to newtons per metre of length
ampres force law states that there is an attractive or repulsive force between two parallel wires carrying an electric current
this force is used in the formal definition of the ampere
the si unit of charge the coulomb was then defined as the quantity of electricity carried in second by a current of ampere
conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge was determined by steady current flowing for a time as
this definition of the ampere was most accurately realised using a kibble balance but in practice the unit was maintained via ohms law from the units of electromotive force and resistance the volt and the ohm since the latter two could be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce the josephson effect and the quantum hall effect respectively
techniques to establish the realisation of an ampere had a relative uncertainty of approximately a few parts in and involved realisations of the watt the ohm and the volt
the redefinition of the si base units defined the ampere by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge to be when expressed in the unit c which is equal to as where the second is defined in terms of the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom
the si unit of charge the coulomb is the quantity of electricity carried in second by a current of ampere
conversely a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second in general charge is determined by steady current flowing for a time as
constant instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes and the charge accumulated over a period of time is expressed in coulombs
the relation of the ampere to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt to the joule
the international system of units is based on si base units the second metre kilogram kelvin ampere mole and candela representing fundamental types of physical quantity or dimensions with all other si units being defined using these
these si derived units can either be given special names eg watt volt lux etc
or defined in terms of others eg metre per second
the units with special names derived from the ampere are there are also some si units that are frequently used in the context of electrical engineering and electrical appliances but can be defined independently of the ampere notably the hertz joule watt candela lumen and lux
like other si units the ampere can be modified by adding a prefix that multiplies it by a power of
in mathematics and computer science an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation
algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing
more advanced algorithms can use conditionals to divert the code execution through various routes and deduce valid inferences achieving automation eventually
using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by alan turing with terms such as memory search and stimulus
in contrast a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results especially in problem domains where there is no well defined correct or optimal result
as an effective method an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time and in a well defined formal language for calculating a function
starting from an initial state and initial input the instructions describe a computation that when executed proceeds through a finite number of well defined successive states eventually producing output and terminating at a final ending state
the transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known as randomized algorithms incorporate random input
since antiquity step by step procedures for solving mathematical problems have been attested
this includes babylonian mathematics egyptian mathematics indian mathematics the ifa oracle greek mathematics and arabic mathematics
around muhammad ibn musa al khwarizmi wrote kitb al isb al hind and kitab al jam wal tafriq al isb al hind
both of these texts are lost in the original arabic at this time
in the early th century latin translations of said al khwarizmi texts involving the hindu arabic numeral system and arithmetic appeared liber alghoarismi de practica arismetrice and liber algorismi de numero indorum
hereby alghoarismi or algorismi is the latinization of al khwarizmis name the text starts with the phrase dixit algorismi
in alexander of villedieu writes a latin text titled carmen de algorismo
it begins with the poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new styled indian dice or hindu numerals
around the english word algorism is attested and then by chaucer in
english adopted the french term
in the th century under the influence of the greek word the latin word was altered to algorithmus
algorism the art or use of cyphers or of numbering by cyphers skill in accounting
augrime skil in accounting or numbring
algorithme the art of reckoning by cyphers
algorithm the art of computing or reckoning by numbers which contains the five principle rules of arithmetick viz
numeration addition subtraction multiplication and division to which may be added extraction of roots it is also calld logistica numeralis
algorism the practical operation in the several parts of specious arithmetick or algebra sometimes it is taken for the practice of common arithmetick by the ten numeral figures
algorithm signifies the first principles and algorism the practical part or knowing how to put the algorithm in practice
since at least the term algorithm is attested to mean a step by step procedure in english
algorithm signifies the art of computing in reference to some particular subject or in some particular way as the algorithm of numbers the algorithm of the differential calculus
in a partial formalization of the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the entscheidungsproblem posed by david hilbert
later formalizations were framed as attempts to define effective calculability or effective method
those formalizations included the gdel herbrand kleene recursive functions of and alonzo churchs lambda calculus of emil posts formulation of and alan turings turing machines of and
an informal definition could be a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations which would include all computer programs and any prescribed bureaucratic procedure or cook book recipe
in general a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually even though infinite loops may sometimes prove desirable
a prototypical example of an algorithm is the euclidean algorithm which is used to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers an example is described by the flowchart above and as an example in a later section
an enumerably infinite set is one whose elements can be put into one to one correspondence with the integers
thus boolos and jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that creates output integers from an arbitrary input integer or integers that in theory can be arbitrarily large
for example an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as y m n but various authors attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this something on the order of the concept of algorithm is also used to define the notion of decidability a notion that is central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from a small set of axioms and rules
in logic the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured as it is not apparently related to the customary physical dimension
from such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems the unavailability of a definition of algorithm that suits both concrete and abstract usage of the term
most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs
however algorithms are also implemented by other means such as in a biological neural network in an electrical circuit or in a mechanical device
algorithms are essential to the way computers process data
many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform in a specific order to carry out a specified task such as calculating employees paychecks or printing students report cards
thus an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a turing complete system
authors who assert this thesis include minsky savage and gurevich turing machines can define computational processes that do not terminate
the informal definitions of algorithms generally require that the algorithm always terminates
this requirement renders the task of deciding whether a formal procedure is an algorithm impossible in the general case due to a major theorem of computability theory known as the halting problem
typically when an algorithm is associated with processing information data can be read from an input source written to an output device and stored for further processing
stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm
in practice the state is stored in one or more data structures
for some of these computational processes the algorithm must be rigorously defined and specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise
this means that any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case by case the criteria for each case must be clear
because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm
instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly and are described as starting from the top and going down to the bottom an idea that is described more formally by flow of control
so far the discussion on the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of imperative programming
this is the most common conception one which attempts to describe a task in discrete mechanical means
unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the assignment operation which sets the value of a variable
it derives from the intuition of memory as a scratchpad
an example of such an assignment can be found below
for some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see functional programming and logic programming
algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation including natural languages pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts programming languages or control tables
natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms
pseudocode flowcharts drakon charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in the statements based on natural language
programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are also often used as a way to define or document algorithms
there is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given turing machine program as a sequence of machine tables as flowcharts and drakon charts or as a form of rudimentary machine code or assembly code called sets of quadruples
for an example of the simple algorithm add mn described in all three levels see examples
algorithm design refers to a method or a mathematical process for problem solving and engineering algorithms
the design of algorithms is part of many solution theories such as divide and conquer or dynamic programming within operation research
techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern
one of the most important aspects of algorithm design is resource efficiency the big o notation is used to describe eg an algorithms run time growth as the size of its input increases
chaitin prefaces his definition with ill show you cant prove that a program is elegant such a proof would solve the halting problem
algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm for a given function multiple algorithms may exist
this is true even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer
rogers observes that it is
important to distinguish between the notion of algorithm ie procedure and the notion of function computable by algorithm ie mapping yielded by procedure
the same function may have several different algorithms
unfortunately there may be a tradeoff between goodness and elegance an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant
an example that uses euclids algorithm appears below
computers models of computation a computer is a restricted type of machine a discrete deterministic mechanical device that blindly follows its instructions
melzaks and lambeks primitive models reduced this notion to four elements discrete distinguishable locations discrete indistinguishable counters an agent and a list of instructions that are effective relative to the capability of the agent
minsky describes a more congenial variation of lambeks abacus model in his very simple bases for computability
minskys machine proceeds sequentially through its five instructions unless either a conditional if then goto or an unconditional goto changes program flow out of sequence
besides halt minskys machine includes three assignment operations zero successor and decrement
rarely must a programmer write code with such a limited instruction set
but minsky shows that his machine is turing complete with only four general types of instructions conditional goto unconditional goto assignment replacement substitution and halt
however a few different assignment instructions are also required for turing completeness their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer
the unconditional goto is convenient it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero eg the instruction z thereafter the instruction if z then goto xxx is unconditional
simulation of an algorithm computer language knuth advises the reader that the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it
immediately take pen and paper and work through an example
but what about a simulation or execution of the real thing the programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator computer computor can effectively execute
stone gives an example of this when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computer must know how to take a square root
if they dont then the algorithm to be effective must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root
this means that the programmer must know a language that is effective relative to the target computing agent
but what model should be used for the simulation van emde boas observes even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead of concrete machines the arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains
it is at this point that the notion of simulation enters
when speed is being measured the instruction set matters
for example the subprogram in euclids algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a modulus instruction available rather than just subtraction
structured programming canonical structures per the church turing thesis any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be turing complete and per minskys demonstrations turing completeness requires only four instruction types conditional goto unconditional goto assignment halt
kemeny and kurtz observe that while undisciplined use of unconditional gotos and conditional if then gotos can result in spaghetti code a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions on the other hand it is also possible and not too hard to write badly structured programs in a structured language
tausworthe augments the three bhm jacopini canonical structures sequence if then else and while do with two more do while and case
an additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to proofs of correctness using mathematical induction
canonical flowchart symbols the graphical aide called a flowchart offers a way to describe and document an algorithm
like the program flow of a minsky machine a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down
its primary symbols are only four the directed arrow showing program flow the rectangle the diamond and the dot
the bhm jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes
sub structures can nest in rectangles but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure
the symbols and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram
one of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order
finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list
from this follows a simple algorithm which can be stated in a high level description in english prose as high level description formal description in mathematics the euclidean algorithm or euclids algorithm is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers the largest number that divides them both without a remainder
it is named after the ancient greek mathematician euclid who first described it in his elements
it is one of the oldest algorithms in common use
it can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form and is a part of many other number theoretic and cryptographic calculations
euclid poses the problem thus given two numbers not prime to one another to find their greatest common measure
he defines a number be a multitude composed of units a counting number a positive integer not including zero
to measure is to place a shorter measuring length s successively along longer length l until the remaining portion r is less than the shorter length s
in modern words remainder r l qs q being the quotient or remainder r is the modulus the integer fractional part left over after the division
for euclids method to succeed the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements the lengths must not be zero and the subtraction must be proper ie a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger
euclids original proof adds a third requirement the two lengths must not be prime to one another
euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a reductio ad absurdum proof that the two numbers common measure is in fact the greatest
while nicomachus algorithm is the same as euclids when the numbers are prime to one another it yields the number for their common measure
so to be precise the following is really nicomachus algorithm
only a few instruction types are required to execute euclids algorithm some logical tests unconditional goto assignment and subtraction
the following algorithm is framed as knuths four step version of euclids and nicomachus but rather than using division to find the remainder it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length s from the remaining length r until r is less than s
the high level description shown in boldface is adapted from knuth e r s
e remainder until the remaining length r in r is less than the shorter length s in s repeatedly subtract the measuring number s in s from the remaining length r in r
e the remainder zero either the last measure was exact the remainder in r is zero and the program can halt or the algorithm must continue the last measure left a remainder in r less than measuring number in s
e s and r the nut of euclids algorithm
use remainder r to measure what was previously smaller number s l serves as a temporary location
how elegant works in place of an outer euclid loop elegant shifts back and forth between two co loops an a b loop that computes a a b and a b a loop that computes b b a
this works because when at last the minuend m is less than or equal to the subtrahend s the minuend can become s and the subtrahend can become the new r in other words the sense of the subtraction reverses
euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor int euclidalgorithm does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do a few test cases usually give some confidence in the core functionality
but tests are not enough
for test cases one source uses and
knuth suggested
another interesting case is the two relatively prime numbers and
but exceptional cases must be identified and tested
will inelegant perform properly when r s s r r s ditto for elegant b a a b a b
what happens when one number is zero both numbers are zero what happens if negative numbers are entered fractional numbers if the input numbers ie the domain of the function computed by the algorithm program is to include only positive integers including zero then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm is a partial function rather than a total function
a notable failure due to exceptions is the ariane flight rocket failure
proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction knuth demonstrates the application of mathematical induction to an extended version of euclids algorithm and he proposes a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm
tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof
elegance versus goodness with only six core instructions elegant is the clear winner compared to inelegant at thirteen instructions
however inelegant is faster
algorithm analysis indicates why this is the case elegant does two conditional tests in every subtraction loop whereas inelegant only does one
as the algorithm requires many loop throughs on average much time is wasted doing a b test that is needed only after the remainder is computed
can the algorithms be improved once the programmer judges a program fit and effective that is it computes the function intended by its author then the question becomes can it be improved the compactness of inelegant can be improved by the elimination of five steps
but chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm rather it can only be done heuristically ie by exhaustive search trial and error cleverness insight application of inductive reasoning etc
observe that steps and are repeated in steps and
comparison with elegant provides a hint that these steps together with steps and can be eliminated
this reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight which makes it more elegant than elegant at nine steps
the speed of elegant can be improved by moving the b test outside of the two subtraction loops
this change calls for the addition of three instructions
now elegant computes the example numbers faster whether this is always the case for any given a b and r s would require a detailed analysis
it is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource is theoretically required for a given algorithm
methods have been developed for the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers for example an algorithm which adds up the elements of a list of n numbers would have a time requirement of o using big o notation
at all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values the sum of all the elements so far and its current position in the input list
therefore it is said to have a space requirement of o if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted or o if it is counted
different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time space or effort than others
for example a binary search algorithm outperforms a sequential search when used for table lookups on sorted lists or arrays
the analysis and study of algorithms is a discipline of computer science and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific programming language or implementation
in this sense algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation
usually pseudocode is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation
however ultimately most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware software platforms and their algorithmic efficiency is eventually put to the test using real code
for the solution of a one off problem the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences but for algorithms designed for fast interactive commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical
scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign
empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance
benchmarks may be used to compare before after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization
empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis though and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner
to illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well established algorithms a recent significant innovation relating to fft algorithms can decrease processing time up to times for applications like medical imaging
in general speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem which are very common in practical applications
speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing to consume less power
there are various ways to classify algorithms each with its own merits
one way to classify algorithms is by implementation means
another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm
there is a certain number of paradigms each different from the other
furthermore each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms
some common paradigms are every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms
related problems in one field are often studied together
some example classes are search algorithms sorting algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms medical algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms and parsing techniques
fields tend to overlap with each other and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other sometimes completely unrelated fields
for example dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields
some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms
there are also mappings from some problems to other problems
owing to this it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them
algorithms by themselves are not usually patentable
in the united states a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts numbers or signals does not constitute processes and hence algorithms are not patentable
however practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable
for example in diamond v
diehr the application of a simple feedback algorithm to aid in the curing of synthetic rubber was deemed patentable
the patenting of software is highly controversial and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms especially data compression algorithms such as unisys lzw patent
additionally some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions
the earliest evidence of algorithms is found in the babylonian mathematics of ancient mesopotamia
a sumerian clay tablet found in shuruppak near baghdad and dated to described the earliest division algorithm
during the hammurabi dynasty babylonian clay tablets described algorithms for computing formulas
algorithms were also used in babylonian astronomy
babylonian clay tablets describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events
algorithms for arithmetic are also found in ancient egyptian mathematics dating back to the rhind mathematical papyrus
algorithms were later used in ancient hellenistic mathematics
two examples are the sieve of eratosthenes which was described in the introduction to arithmetic by nicomachus and the euclidean algorithm which was first described in euclids elements
tally marks to keep track of their flocks their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay
through the babylonian and egyptian use of marks and symbols eventually roman numerals and the abacus evolved
tally marks appear prominently in unary numeral system arithmetic used in turing machine and post turing machine computations
muhammad ibn ms al khwrizm a persian mathematician wrote the al jabr in the th century
the terms algorism and algorithm are derived from the name al khwrizm while the term algebra is derived from the book al jabr
in europe the word algorithm was originally used to refer to the sets of rules and techniques used by al khwarizmi to solve algebraic equations before later being generalized to refer to any set of rules or techniques
this eventually culminated in leibnizs notion of the calculus ratiocinator the first cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code was developed by al kindi a th century arab mathematician in a manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages
he gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis the earliest codebreaking algorithm
the clock bolter credits the invention of the weight driven clock as the key invention europe in the middle ages in particular the verge escapement that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock
the accurate automatic machine led immediately to mechanical automata beginning in the th century and finally to computational machines the difference engine and analytical engines of charles babbage and countess ada lovelace mid th century
lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer babbages analytical engine the first device considered a real turing complete computer instead of just a calculator and is sometimes called historys first programmer as a result though a full implementation of babbages second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime
logical machines stanley jevons logical abacus and logical machine the technical problem was to reduce boolean equations when presented in a form similar to what is now known as karnaugh maps
jevons describes first a simple abacus of slips of wood furnished with pins contrived so that any part or class of the combinations can be picked out mechanically
more recently however i have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a logical machine his machine came equipped with certain moveable wooden rods and at the foot are keys like those of a piano machine in effect almost identical to posts formulation j
barkley rossers definition of effective method in terms of a machine
kleenes proposal of a precursor to church thesis that he called thesis i and a few years later kleenes renaming his thesis churchs thesis and proposing turings thesis
his symbol space would be alan turings work preceded that of stibitz it is unknown whether stibitz knew of the work of turing
turings biographer believed that turings use of a typewriter like model derived from a youthful interest alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy mrs turing had a typewriter and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter mechanical
given the prevalence at the time of morse code telegraphy ticker tape machines and teletypewriters it is quite possible that all were influences on turing during his youth
turing his model of computation is now called a turing machine begins as did post with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and states of mind
but he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers
it may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind
the most general single operation must therefore be taken to be one of the following j
barkley rosser defined an effective method in the following manner rossers footnote no

stephen c
kleene defined as his now famous thesis i known as the church turing thesis
but he did this in the following context a number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of algorithm and activity is on going because of issues surrounding in particular foundations of mathematics and philosophy of mind

an annual plant is a plant that completes its life cycle from germination to the production of seeds within one growing season and then dies
the length of growing seasons and period in which they take place vary according to geographical location and may not correspond to the four traditional seasonal divisions of the year
with respect to the traditional seasons annual plants are generally categorized into summer annuals and winter annuals
summer annuals germinate during spring or early summer and mature by autumn of the same year
winter annuals germinate during the autumn and mature during the spring or summer of the following calendar year
one seed to seed life cycle for an annual plant can occur in as little as a month in some species though most last several months
oilseed rapa can go from seed to seed in about five weeks under a bank of fluorescent lamps
this style of growing is often used in classrooms for education
many desert annuals are therophytes because their seed to seed life cycle is only weeks and they spend most of the year as seeds to survive dry conditions
in cultivation many food plants are or are grown as annuals including virtually all domesticated grains
some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate
carrot celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots petioles and leaves respectively
tomato sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals
ornamental perennials commonly grown as annuals are impatiens mirabilis wax begonia snapdragon pelargonium coleus and petunia
examples of true annuals include corn wheat rice lettuce peas watermelon beans zinnia and marigold
summer annuals sprout flower produce seed and die during the warmer months of the year
the lawn weed crabgrass is a summer annual
winter annuals germinate in autumn or winter live through the winter then bloom in winter or spring
the plants grow and bloom during the cool season when most other plants are dormant or other annuals are in seed form waiting for warmer weather to germinate
winter annuals die after flowering and setting seed
the seeds germinate in the autumn or winter when the soil temperature is cool
winter annuals typically grow low to the ground where they are usually sheltered from the coldest nights by snow cover and make use of warm periods in winter for growth when the snow melts
some common winter annuals include henbit deadnettle chickweed and winter cress
winter annuals are important ecologically as they provide vegetative cover that prevents soil erosion during winter and early spring when no other cover exists and they provide fresh vegetation for animals and birds that feed on them
although they are often considered to be weeds in gardens this viewpoint is not always necessary as most of them die when the soil temperature warms up again in early to late spring when other plants are still dormant and have not yet leafed out
even though they do not compete directly with cultivated plants sometimes winter annuals are considered a pest in commercial agriculture because they can be hosts for insect pests or fungal diseases which attack crops being cultivated
the property that they prevent the soil from drying out can also be problematic for commercial agriculture
in it was discovered that the inactivation of only two genes in one species of annual plant leads to its conversion into a perennial plant
researchers deactivated the soc and ful genes of arabidopsis thaliana
this switch established phenotypes common in perennial plants such as wood formation
the anthophytes are a paraphyletic grouping of plant taxa bearing flower like reproductive structures
the group once thought to be a clade contained the angiosperms the extant flowering plants such as roses and grasses as well as the gnetales and the extinct bennettitales
detailed morphological and molecular studies have shown that the group is not actually monophyletic with proposed floral homologies of the gnetophytes and the angiosperms having evolved in parallel
this makes it easier to reconcile molecular clock data that suggests that the angiosperms diverged from the gymnosperms around mya
some more recent studies have used the word anthophyte to describe a group which includes the angiosperms and a variety of fossils but not the gnetales
an atlas is a collection of maps
mouthwash mouth rinse oral rinse or mouth bath is a liquid which is held in the mouth passively or swirled around the mouth by contraction of the perioral muscles and or movement of the head and may be gargled where the head is tilted back and the liquid bubbled at the back of the mouth
usually mouthwashes are antiseptic solutions intended to reduce the microbial load in the mouth although other mouthwashes might be given for other reasons such as for their analgesic anti inflammatory or anti fungal action
additionally some rinses act as saliva substitutes to neutralize acid and keep the mouth moist in xerostomia
cosmetic mouthrinses temporarily control or reduce bad breath and leave the mouth with a pleasant taste
rinsing with water or mouthwash after brushing with a fluoride toothpaste can reduce the availability of salivary fluoride
this can lower the anti cavity re mineralization and antibacterial effects of fluoride
fluoridated mouthwash may mitigate this effect or in high concentrations increase available fluoride but is not as cost effective as leaving the fluoride toothpaste on the teeth after brushing
a group of experts discussing post brushing rinsing in found that although there was clear guidance given in many public health advice publications to spit avoid rinsing with water excessive rinsing with water they believed there was a limited evidence base for best practice
common use involves rinsing the mouth with about ml of mouthwash
the wash is typically swished or gargled for about half a minute and then spat out
most companies suggest not drinking water immediately after using mouthwash
in some brands the expectorate is stained so that one can see the bacteria and debris
mouthwash should not be used immediately after brushing the teeth so as not to wash away the beneficial fluoride residue left from the toothpaste
similarly the mouth should not be rinsed out with water after brushing
patients were told to spit dont rinse after toothbrushing as part of a national health service campaign in the uk
a fluoride mouthrinse can be used at a different time of the day to brushing
gargling is where the head is tilted back allowing the mouthwash to sit in the back of the mouth while exhaling causing the liquid to bubble
gargling is practiced in japan for perceived prevention of viral infection
one commonly used way is with infusions or tea
in some cultures gargling is usually done in private typically in a bathroom at a sink so the liquid can be rinsed away
if one drinks mouthwash serious harm and even death can quickly result from the high alcohol content and other harmful substances in mouthwash
it is a common cause of death among homeless people during winter months because a person can feel warmer after drinking it
the most commonly used mouthwashes are commercial antiseptics which are used at home as part of an oral hygiene routine
mouthwashes combine ingredients to treat a variety of oral conditions
variations are common and mouthwash has no standard formulation so its use and recommendation involves concerns about patient safety
some manufacturers of mouthwash state that their antiseptic and antiplaque mouthwashes kill the bacterial plaque that causes cavities gingivitis and bad breath
it is however generally agreed that the use of mouthwash does not eliminate the need for both brushing and flossing
the american dental association asserts that regular brushing and proper flossing are enough in most cases in addition to regular dental check ups although they approve many mouthwashes
for many patients however the mechanical methods could be tedious and time consuming and additionally some local conditions may render them especially difficult
chemotherapeutic agents including mouthwashes could have a key role as adjuncts to daily home care preventing and controlling supragingival plaque gingivitis and oral malodor
minor and transient side effects of mouthwashes are very common such as taste disturbance tooth staining sensation of a dry mouth etc
alcohol containing mouthwashes may make dry mouth and halitosis worse as they dry out the mouth
soreness ulceration and redness may sometimes occur if the person is allergic or sensitive to mouthwash ingredients such as preservatives coloring flavors and fragrances
such effects might be reduced or eliminated by diluting the mouthwash with water using a different mouthwash or foregoing mouthwash entirely
prescription mouthwashes are used prior to and after oral surgery procedures such as tooth extraction or to treat the pain associated with mucositis caused by radiation therapy or chemotherapy
they are also prescribed for aphthous ulcers other oral ulcers and other mouth pain
magic mouthwashes are prescription mouthwashes compounded in a pharmacy from a list of ingredients specified by a doctor
despite a lack of evidence that prescription mouthwashes are more effective in decreasing the pain of oral lesions many patients and prescribers continue to use them
there has been only one controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of magic mouthwash it shows no difference in efficacy between the most common magic mouthwash formulation on the one hand and commercial mouthwashes or a saline baking soda solution on the other
current guidelines suggest that saline solution is just as effective as magic mouthwash in pain relief and in shortening the healing time of oral mucositis from cancer therapies
the first known references to mouth rinsing is in ayurveda for treatment of gingivitis
later in the greek and roman periods mouth rinsing following mechanical cleansing became common among the upper classes and hippocrates recommended a mixture of salt alum and vinegar
the jewish talmud dating back about years suggests a cure for gum ailments containing dough water and olive oil
the ancient chinese had also gargled salt water tea and wine as a form of mouthwash after meals due to the antiseptic properties of those liquids
before europeans came to the americas native north american and mesoamerican cultures used mouthwashes often made from plants such as coptis trifolia
indeed aztec dentistry was more advanced than european dentistry of the age
peoples of the americas used salt water mouthwashes for sore throats and other mouthwashes for problems such as teething and mouth ulcers
anton van leeuwenhoek the famous th century microscopist discovered living organisms in deposits on the teeth
he also found organisms in water from the canal next to his home in delft
he experimented with samples by adding vinegar or brandy and found that this resulted in the immediate immobilization or killing of the organisms suspended in water
next he tried rinsing the mouth of himself and somebody else with a mouthwash containing vinegar or brandy and found that living organisms remained in the dental plaque
he concluded correctly that the mouthwash either did not reach or was not present long enough to kill the plaque organisms
in german richard seifert invented mouthwash product odol which was produced by company founder karl august lingner in dresden
that remained the state of affairs until the late s when harald loe demonstrated that a chlorhexidine compound could prevent the build up of dental plaque
the reason for chlorhexidines effectiveness is that it strongly adheres to surfaces in the mouth and thus remains present in effective concentrations for many hours
since then commercial interest in mouthwashes has been intense and several newer products claim effectiveness in reducing the build up in dental plaque and the associated severity of gingivitis in addition to fighting bad breath
many of these solutions aim to control the volatile sulfur compound creating anaerobic bacteria that live in the mouth and excrete substances that lead to bad breath and unpleasant mouth taste
for example the number of mouthwash variants in the united states of america has grown from to to
research in the field of microbiotas shows that only a limited set of microbes cause tooth decay with most of the bacteria in the human mouth being harmless
focused attention on cavity causing bacteria such as streptococcus mutans has led research into new mouthwash treatments that prevent these bacteria from initially growing
while current mouthwash treatments must be used with a degree of frequency to prevent this bacteria from regrowing future treatments could provide a viable long term solution
alcohol is added to mouthwash not to destroy bacteria but to act as a carrier agent for essential active ingredients such as menthol eucalyptol and thymol which help to penetrate plaque
sometimes a significant amount of alcohol is added as a carrier for the flavor to provide bite
because of the alcohol content it is possible to fail a breathalyzer test after rinsing although breath alcohol levels return to normal after minutes
in addition alcohol is a drying agent which encourages bacterial activity in the mouth releasing more malodorous volatile sulfur compounds
therefore alcohol containing mouthwash may temporarily worsen halitosis in those who already have it or indeed be the sole cause of halitosis in other individuals
it is hypothesized that alcohol in mouthwashes acts as a carcinogen
generally there is no scientific consensus about this
one review stated the same researchers also state that the risk of acquiring oral cancer rises almost five times for users of alcohol containing mouthwash who neither smoke nor drink
in addition the authors highlight side effects from several mainstream mouthwashes that included dental erosion and accidental poisoning of children
the review garnered media attention and conflicting opinions from other researchers
yinka ebo of cancer research uk disputed the findings concluding that there is still not enough evidence to suggest that using mouthwash that contains alcohol will increase the risk of mouth cancer
studies conducted in and did not support an association between alcohol containing mouth rinses and oral cancer
andrew penman chief executive of the cancer council new south wales called for further research on the matter
in a march brief the american dental association said the available evidence does not support a connection between oral cancer and alcohol containing mouthrinse
many newer brands of mouthwash are alcohol free not just in response to consumer concerns about oral cancer but also to cater for religious groups who abstain from alcohol consumption
in painful oral conditions such as aphthous stomatitis analgesic mouthrinses are sometimes used to ease pain commonly used before meals to reduce discomfort while eating
benzoic acid acts as a buffer
betamethasone is sometimes used as an anti inflammatory corticosteroid mouthwash
it may be used for severe inflammatory conditions of the oral mucosa such as the severe forms of aphthous stomatitis
cetylpyridinium chloride containing mouthwash is used in some specialized mouthwashes for halitosis
cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash has less anti plaque effect than chlorhexidine and may cause staining of teeth or sometimes an oral burning sensation or ulceration
chlorhexidine digluconate is a chemical antiseptic and is used in a solution as a mouthwash
there is no evidence to support that higher concentrations are more effective in controlling dental plaque and gingivitis
a randomized clinical trial conducted in rabat university in morocco found better results in plaque inhibition when chlorohexidine with alcohol base was used when compared to an alcohol free chlorhexidine mouthrinse
chlorhexidine has good substantivity
it has anti plaque action and also some anti fungal action
it is especially effective against gram negative rods
the proportion of gram negative rods increase as gingivitis develops so it is also used to reduce gingivitis
it is sometimes used as an adjunct to prevent dental caries and to treat periodontal disease although it does not penetrate into periodontal pockets well
chlorhexidine mouthwash alone is unable to prevent plaque so it is not a substitute for regular toothbrushing and flossing
instead chlorhexidine mouthwash is more effective when used as an adjunctive treatment with toothbrushing and flossing
in the short term if toothbrushing is impossible due to pain as may occur in primary herpetic gingivostomatitis chlorhexidine mouthwash is used as a temporary substitute for other oral hygiene measures
it is not suited for use in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis however
rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash before and after a tooth extraction may reduce the risk of a dry socket
other uses of chlorhexidine mouthwash include prevention of oral candidiasis in immunocompromised persons treatment of denture related stomatitis mucosal ulceration erosions and oral mucosal lesions general burning sensation and many other uses
chlorhexidine mouthwash is known to have minor adverse effects
chlorhexidine binds to tannins meaning that prolonged use in persons who consume coffee tea or red wine is associated with extrinsic staining of teeth
a systematic review of commercial chlorhexidine products with anti discoloration systems found that the adss were able to reduce tooth staining without affecting the beneficial effects of chlorhexidine
chlorhexidine mouthwash can also cause taste disturbance or alteration
chlorhexidine is rarely associated with other issues like overgrowth of enterobacteria in persons with leukemia desquamation irritation and stomatitis of oral mucosa salivary gland pain and swelling and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
hexetidine also has anti plaque analgesic astringent and anti malodor properties but is considered an inferior alternative to chlorhexidine
in traditional ayurvedic medicine the use of oil mouthwashes is called kavala or gandusha and this practice has more recently been re marketed by the complementary and alternative medicine industry as oil pulling
its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins which are known as ama in ayurvedic medicine and thereby reducing inflammation
ayurvedic literature claims that oil pulling is capable of improving oral and systemic health including a benefit in conditions such as headaches migraines diabetes mellitus asthma and acne as well as whitening teeth
oil pulling has received little study and there is little evidence to support claims made by the techniques advocates
when compared with chlorhexidine in one small study it was found to be less effective at reducing oral bacterial load and the other health claims of oil pulling have failed scientific verification or have not been investigated
there is a report of lipid pneumonia caused by accidental inhalation of the oil during oil pulling
the mouth is rinsed with approximately one tablespoon of oil for minutes then spat out
sesame oil coconut oil and ghee are traditionally used but newer oils such as sunflower oil are also used
phenolic compounds and monoterpenes include essential oil constituents that have some antibacterial properties such as eucalyptol eugenol hinokitiol menthol phenol or thymol
essential oils are oils which have been extracted from plants
mouthwashes based on essential oils could be more effective than traditional mouthcare as anti gingival treatments
they have been found effective in reducing halitosis and are being used in several commercial mouthwashes
anti cavity mouthwashes use sodium fluoride to protect against tooth decay
fluoride containing mouthwashes are used as prevention for dental caries for individuals who are considered at higher risk for tooth decay whether due to xerostomia related to salivary dysfunction or side effects of medication to not drinking fluoridated water or to being physically unable to care for their oral needs and as treatment for those with dentinal hypersensitivity gingival recession root exposure
flavoring agents include sweeteners such as sorbitol sucralose sodium saccharin and xylitol which stimulate salivary function due to their sweetness and taste and helps restore the mouth to a neutral level of acidity
xylitol rinses double as a bacterial inhibitor and have been used as substitute for alcohol to avoid dryness of mouth associated with alcohol
hydrogen peroxide can be used as an oxidizing mouthwash
it kills anaerobic bacteria and also has a mechanical cleansing action when it froths as it comes into contact with debris in mouth
it is often used in the short term to treat acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis
side effects can occur with prolonged use including hypertrophy of the lingual papillae
enzymes and non enzymatic proteins such as lactoperoxidase lysozyme and lactoferrin have been used in mouthwashes to reduce levels of oral bacteria and hence of the acids produced by these bacteria
oral lidocaine is useful for the treatment of mucositis symptoms induced by radiation or chemotherapy
there is evidence that lidocaine anesthetic mouthwash has the potential to be systemically absorbed when it was tested in patients with oral mucositis who underwent a bone marrow transplant
methyl salicylate functions as an antiseptic antiinflammatory and analgesic agent a flavoring and a fragrance
methyl salicylate has some anti plaque action but less than chlorhexidine
methyl salicylate does not stain teeth
nystatin suspension is an antifungal ingredient used for the treatment of oral candidiasis
a randomized clinical trial found promising results in controlling and reducing dentine hypersensitivity when potassium oxalate mouthwash was used in conjugation with toothbrushing
a study found that gargling three times a day with simple water or with a povidone iodine solution was effective in preventing upper respiratory infection and decreasing the severity of symptoms if contracted
other sources attribute the benefit to a simple placebo effect
pvp i in general covers a wider virucidal spectrum covering both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses than the other commercially available antiseptics which also includes the novel sars cov virus
sanguinarine containing mouthwashes are marketed as anti plaque and anti malodor treatments
sanguinarine is a toxic alkaloid herbal extract obtained from plants such as sanguinaria canadensis argemone mexicana and others
however its use is strongly associated with the development of leukoplakia usually in the buccal sulcus
this type of leukoplakia has been termed sanguinaria associated keratosis and more than of people with leukoplakia in the vestibule of the mouth have used this substance
upon stopping contact with the causative substance the lesions may persist for years
although this type of leukoplakia may show dysplasia the potential for malignant transformation is unknown
ironically elements within the complementary and alternative medicine industry promote the use of sanguinaria as a therapy for cancer
sodium bicarbonate is sometimes combined with salt to make a simple homemade mouthwash indicated for any of the reasons that a saltwater mouthwash might be used
pre mixed mouthwashes of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride in aqueous solution are marketed although pharmacists will easily be able to produce such a formulation from the base ingredients when required
sodium bicarbonate mouthwash is sometimes used to remove viscous saliva and to aid visualization of the oral tissues during examination of the mouth
saline has a mechanical cleansing action and an antiseptic action as it is a hypertonic solution in relation to bacteria which undergo lysis
the heat of the solution produces a therapeutic increase in blood flow to the surgical site promoting healing
hot saltwater mouthwashes also encourage the draining of pus from dental abscesses
in contrast if heat is applied on the side of the face rather than inside the mouth it may cause a dental abscess to drain extra orally which is later associated with an area of fibrosis on the face
saltwater mouthwashes are also routinely used after oral surgery to keep food debris out of healing wounds and to prevent infection
some oral surgeons consider saltwater mouthwashes the mainstay of wound cleanliness after surgery
in dental extractions hot saltwater mouthbaths should start about hours after a dental extraction
the term mouth bath implies that the liquid is passively held in the mouth rather than vigorously swilled around
once the blood clot has stabilized the mouthwash can be used more vigorously
these mouthwashes tend to be advised for use about times per day especially after meals
sodium lauryl sulfate is used as a foaming agent in many oral hygiene products including many mouthwashes
some may suggest that it is probably advisable to use mouthwash at least an hour after brushing with toothpaste when the toothpaste contains sls since the anionic compounds in the sls toothpaste can deactivate cationic agents present in the mouthwash
sucralfate is a mucosal coating agent composed of an aluminum salt of sulfated sucrose
it is not recommended for use in the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy or chemoradiation due to a lack of efficacy found in a well designed randomized controlled trial
tetracycline is an antibiotic which may sometimes be used as a mouthwash in adults
it is sometimes use for herpetiforme ulceration but prolonged use may lead to oral candidiasis as the fungal population of the mouth overgrows in the absence of enough competing bacteria
similarly minocycline mouthwashes of concentrations can relieve symptoms of recurrent aphthous stomatitis
erythromycin is similar
a tranexamic acid solution is sometimes used as an antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with coagulopathies or who are taking anticoagulants
triclosan is a non ionic chlorinate bisphenol antiseptic found in some mouthwashes
when used in mouthwash there is moderate substantivity broad spectrum anti bacterial action some anti fungal action and significant anti plaque effect especially when combined with a copolymer or zinc citrate
triclosan does not cause staining of the teeth
the safety of triclosan has been questioned
astringents like zinc chloride provide a pleasant tasting sensation and shrink tissues
zinc when used in combination with other antiseptic agents can limit the buildup of tartar
alexander iii of macedon commonly known as alexander the great was a king of the ancient greek kingdom of macedon
he succeeded his father philip ii to the throne in bc at the age of and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout western asia and egypt
by the age of he had created one of the largest empires in history stretching from greece to northwestern india
he was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of historys greatest and most successful military commanders
until the age of alexander was tutored by aristotle
in bc shortly after his assumption of kingship over macedon he campaigned in the balkans and reasserted control over thrace and illyria before marching on the city of thebes which was subsequently destroyed in battle
alexander then led the league of corinth and used his authority to launch the pan hellenic project envisaged by his father assuming leadership over all greeks in their conquest of persia
in bc he invaded the achaemenid persian empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for years
following his conquest of asia minor alexander broke the power of achaemenid persia in a series of decisive battles including those at issus and gaugamela he subsequently overthrew darius iii and conquered the achaemenid empire in its entirety
after the fall of persia the macedonian empire held a vast swath of territory between the adriatic sea and the indus river
alexander endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the great outer sea and invaded india in bc achieving an important victory over porus an ancient indian king of present day punjab at the battle of the hydaspes
due to the demand of his homesick troops he eventually turned back at the beas river and later died in bc in babylon the city of mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empires capital
alexanders death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a greek invasion of arabia
in the years following his death a series of civil wars broke out across the macedonian empire eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the diadochi
with his death marking the start of the hellenistic period alexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered such as greco buddhism and hellenistic judaism
he founded more than twenty cities with the most prominent being the city of alexandria in egypt
alexanders settlement of greek colonists and the resulting spread of greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the indian subcontinent
the hellenistic period developed through the roman empire into modern western culture the greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the byzantine empire up until its collapse in the mid th century ad
greek speaking communities in central anatolia and in far eastern anatolia survived until the greek genocide and greek turkish population exchanges of the early th century ad
alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of achilles featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both greek and non greek cultures
his military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide
alexander iii was born in pella the capital of the kingdom of macedon on the sixth day of the ancient greek month of hekatombaion which probably corresponds to july bc
he was the son of the erstwhile king of macedon philip ii and his fourth wife olympias
although philip had seven or eight wives olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to alexander
several legends surround alexanders birth and childhood
according to the ancient greek biographer plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to philip olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away
sometime after the wedding philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image
plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams that olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that alexanders father was zeus
ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious olympias promulgated the story of alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious
on the day alexander was born philip was preparing a siege on the city of potidea on the peninsula of chalcidice
that same day philip received news that his general parmenion had defeated the combined illyrian and paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the olympic games
it was also said that on this day the temple of artemis in ephesus one of the seven wonders of the world burnt down
this led hegesias of magnesia to say that it had burnt down because artemis was away attending the birth of alexander
such legends may have emerged when alexander was king and possibly at his instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception
in his early years alexander was raised by a nurse lanike sister of alexanders future general cleitus the black
later in his childhood alexander was tutored by the strict leonidas a relative of his mother and by lysimachus of acarnania
alexander was raised in the manner of noble macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt
when alexander was ten years old a trader from thessaly brought philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents
the horse refused to be mounted and philip ordered it away
alexander however detecting the horses fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed
plutarch stated that philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring my boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions
macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him
alexander named it bucephalas meaning ox head
bucephalas carried alexander as far as india
when the animal died alexander named a city after him bucephala
when alexander was philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as isocrates and speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the academy to take up the post
in the end philip chose aristotle and provided the temple of the nymphs at mieza as a classroom
in return for teaching alexander philip agreed to rebuild aristotles hometown of stageira which philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex citizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile
mieza was like a boarding school for alexander and the children of macedonian nobles such as ptolemy hephaistion and cassander
many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the companions
aristotle taught alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art
under aristotles tutelage alexander developed a passion for the works of homer and in particular the iliad aristotle gave him an annotated copy which alexander later carried on his campaigns
alexander was able to quote euripides from memory
during his youth alexander was also acquainted with persian exiles at the macedonian court who received the protection of philip ii for several years as they opposed artaxerxes iii
among them were artabazos ii and his daughter barsine possible future mistress of alexander who resided at the macedonian court from to bc as well as amminapes future satrap of alexander or a persian nobleman named sisines
this gave the macedonian court a good knowledge of persian issues and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the macedonian state
suda writes that anaximenes of lampsacus was one of alexanders teachers and that anaximenes also accompanied alexander on his campaigns
at the age of alexanders education under aristotle ended
philip ii had waged war against the thracians to the north which left alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent
during philips absence the thracian tribe of maedi revolted against macedonia
alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory
the territory was colonized and a city named alexandropolis was founded
upon philips return alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern thrace
campaigning against the greek city of perinthus alexander reportedly saved his fathers life
meanwhile the city of amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to apollo near delphi a sacrilege that gave philip the opportunity to further intervene in greek affairs
while philip was occupied in thrace alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern greece
concerned that other greek states might intervene alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack illyria instead
during this turmoil the illyrians invaded macedonia only to be repelled by alexander
philip and his army joined his son in bc and they marched south through thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its theban garrison
they went on to occupy the city of elatea only a few days march from both athens and thebes
the athenians led by demosthenes voted to seek alliance with thebes against macedonia
both athens and philip sent embassies to win thebess favour but athens won the contest
philip marched on amphissa capturing the mercenaries sent there by demosthenes and accepting the citys surrender
philip then returned to elatea sending a final offer of peace to athens and thebes who both rejected it
as philip marched south his opponents blocked him near chaeronea boeotia
during the ensuing battle of chaeronea philip commanded the right wing and alexander the left accompanied by a group of philips trusted generals
according to the ancient sources the two sides fought bitterly for some time
philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested athenian hoplites to follow thus breaking their line
alexander was the first to break the theban lines followed by philips generals
having damaged the enemys cohesion philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them
with the athenians lost the thebans were surrounded
left to fight alone they were defeated
after the victory at chaeronea philip and alexander marched unopposed into the peloponnese welcomed by all cities however when they reached sparta they were refused but did not resort to war
at corinth philip established a hellenic alliance which included most greek city states except sparta
philip was then named hegemon of this league and announced his plans to attack the persian empire
when philip returned to pella he fell in love with and married cleopatra eurydice in bc the niece of his general attalus
the marriage made alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of cleopatra eurydice would be a fully macedonian heir while alexander was only half macedonian
during the wedding banquet a drunken attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir
in bc alexander fled macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother king alexander i of epirus in dodona capital of the molossians
he continued to illyria where he sought refuge with one or more illyrian kings perhaps with glaucias and was treated as a guest despite having defeated them in battle a few years before
however it appears philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son
accordingly alexander returned to macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend demaratus who mediated between the two parties
in the following year the persian satrap of caria pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to alexanders half brother philip arrhidaeus
olympias and several of alexanders friends suggested this showed philip intended to make arrhidaeus his heir
alexander reacted by sending an actor thessalus of corinth to tell pixodarus that he should not offer his daughters hand to an illegitimate son but instead to alexander
when philip heard of this he stopped the negotiations and scolded alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a carian explaining that he wanted a better bride for him
philip exiled four of alexanders friends harpalus nearchus ptolemy and erigyius and had the corinthians bring thessalus to him in chains
in summer bc while at aegae attending the wedding of his daughter cleopatra to olympiass brother alexander i of epirus philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards pausanias
as pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of alexanders companions perdiccas and leonnatus
alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of
alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne
he had his cousin the former amyntas iv executed
he also had two macedonian princes from the region of lyncestis killed for having been involved in his fathers assassination but spared a third alexander lyncestes
olympias had cleopatra eurydice and europa her daughter by philip burned alive
when alexander learned about this he was furious
alexander also ordered the murder of attalus who was in command of the advance guard of the army in asia minor and cleopatras uncle
attalus was at that time corresponding with demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to athens
attalus also had severely insulted alexander and following cleopatras murder alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive
alexander spared arrhidaeus who was by all accounts mentally disabled possibly as a result of poisoning by olympias
news of philips death roused many states into revolt including thebes athens thessaly and the thracian tribes north of macedon
when news of the revolts reached alexander he responded quickly
though advised to use diplomacy alexander mustered macedonian cavalry and rode south towards thessaly
he found the thessalian army occupying the pass between mount olympus and mount ossa and ordered his men to ride over mount ossa
when the thessalians awoke the next day they found alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered adding their cavalry to alexanders force
he then continued south towards the peloponnese
alexander stopped at thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the amphictyonic league before heading south to corinth
athens sued for peace and alexander pardoned the rebels
the famous encounter between alexander and diogenes the cynic occurred during alexanders stay in corinth
when alexander asked diogenes what he could do for him the philosopher disdainfully asked alexander to stand a little to the side as he was blocking the sunlight
this reply apparently delighted alexander who is reported to have said but verily if i were not alexander i would like to be diogenes
at corinth alexander took the title of hegemon and like philip was appointed commander for the coming war against persia
he also received news of a thracian uprising
before crossing to asia alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders
in the spring of bc he advanced to suppress several revolts
starting from amphipolis he travelled east into the country of the independent thracians and at mount haemus the macedonian army attacked and defeated the thracian forces manning the heights
the macedonians marched into the country of the triballi and defeated their army near the lyginus river
alexander then marched for three days to the danube encountering the getae tribe on the opposite shore
crossing the river at night he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish
news then reached alexander that the illyrian chieftain cleitus and king glaukias of the taulantii were in open revolt against his authority
marching west into illyria alexander defeated each in turn forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops
with these victories he secured his northern frontier
while alexander campaigned north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again
alexander immediately headed south
while the other cities again hesitated thebes decided to fight
the theban resistance was ineffective and alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other boeotian cities
the end of thebes cowed athens leaving all of greece temporarily at peace
alexander then set out on his asian campaign leaving antipater as regent
after his victory at the battle of chaeronea philip ii began the work of establishing himself as hgemn of a league which according to diodorus was to wage a campaign against the persians for the sundry grievances greece suffered in and free the greek cities of the western coast and islands from achaemenid rule
in he sent parmenion with amyntas andromenes and attalus and an army of men into anatolia to make preparations for an invasion
at first all went well
the greek cities on the western coast of anatolia revolted until the news arrived that philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son alexander
the macedonians were demoralized by philips death and were subsequently defeated near magnesia by the achaemenids under the command of the mercenary memnon of rhodes
taking over the invasion project of philip ii alexanders army crossed the hellespont in bc with approximately soldiers cavalry and a fleet of ships with crews numbering drawn from macedon and various greek city states mercenaries and feudally raised soldiers from thrace paionia and illyria
he showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the persian empire by throwing a spear into asian soil and saying he accepted asia as a gift from the gods
this also showed alexanders eagerness to fight in contrast to his fathers preference for diplomacy
after an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of the granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis he then proceeded along the ionian coast granting autonomy and democracy to the cities
miletus held by achaemenid forces required a delicate siege operation with persian naval forces nearby
further south at halicarnassus in caria alexander successfully waged his first large scale siege eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea
alexander left the government of caria to a member of the hecatomnid dynasty ada who adopted alexander
from halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the persians naval bases
from pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and alexander moved inland
at termessos alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian city
at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the hitherto unsolvable gordian knot a feat said to await the future king of asia
according to the story alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword
in spring bc alexander crossed the taurus into cilicia
after a long pause due to an illness he marched on towards syria
though outmanoeuvered by dariuss significantly larger army he marched back to cilicia where he defeated darius at issus
darius fled the battle causing his army to collapse and left behind his wife his two daughters his mother sisygambis and a fabulous treasure
he offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost and a ransom of talents for his family
alexander replied that since he was now king of asia it was he alone who decided territorial divisions
alexander proceeded to take possession of syria and most of the coast of the levant
in the following year bc he was forced to attack tyre which he captured after a long and difficult siege
the men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery
when alexander destroyed tyre most of the towns on the route to egypt quickly capitulated
however alexander was met with resistance at gaza
the stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill requiring a siege
when his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible
this encouraged alexander all the more to make the attempt
after three unsuccessful assaults the stronghold fell but not before alexander had received a serious shoulder wound
as in tyre men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery
egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by alexander from the persians
after his trip to siwa alexander was crowned in the temple of ptah at memphis
it appears that the egyptian people did not find it disturbing that he was a foreigner nor that he was absent for virtually his entire reign
alexander restored the temples neglected by the persians and dedicated new monuments to the egyptian gods
in the temple of luxor near karnak he built a chapel for the sacred barge
during his brief months in egypt he reformed the taxation system on the greek models and organized the military occupation of the country but early in bc he left for asia in pursuit of the persians
alexander advanced on egypt in later bc where he was regarded as a liberator
to legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs alexander made sacrifices to the gods at memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of amun ra at the siwa oasis
he was pronounced son of the deity amun at the oracle of siwa oasis in the libyan desert
henceforth alexander often referred to zeus ammon as his true father and after his death currency depicted him adorned with the horns of ammon as a symbol of his divinity
the greeks interpreted this message one that the gods addressed to all pharaohs as a prophecy
during his stay in egypt he founded alexandria which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic kingdom after his death
control of egypt passed to ptolemy i the founder of the ptolemaic dynasty after the death of alexander
leaving egypt in bc alexander marched eastward into achaemenid assyria in upper mesopotamia and defeated darius again at the battle of gaugamela
darius once more fled the field and alexander chased him as far as arbela
gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two
darius fled over the mountains to ecbatana while alexander captured babylon
babylonian astronomical diaries say that the king of the world alexander sent his scouts with a message to the people of babylon before entering the city i shall not enter your houses
from babylon alexander went to susa one of the achaemenid capitals and captured its treasury
he sent the bulk of his army to the persian ceremonial capital of persepolis via the persian royal road
alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city
he then stormed the pass of the persian gates which had been blocked by a persian army under ariobarzanes and then hurried to persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury
on entering persepolis alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days
alexander stayed in persepolis for five months
during his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes i and spread to the rest of the city
possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the acropolis of athens during the second persian war by xerxes plutarch and diodorus allege that alexanders companion the hetaera thas instigated and started the fire
even as he watched the city burn alexander immediately began to regret his decision
plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires but that the flames had already spread to most of the city
curtius claims that alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning
plutarch recounts an anecdote in which alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of xerxes as if it were a live person alexander then chased darius first into media and then parthia
the persian king no longer controlled his own destiny and was taken prisoner by bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman
as alexander approached bessus had his men fatally stab the great king and then declared himself dariuss successor as artaxerxes v before retreating into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander
alexander buried dariuss remains next to his achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral
he claimed that while dying darius had named him as his successor to the achaemenid throne
the achaemenid empire is normally considered to have fallen with darius
however as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by alexander under his own rule he in the words of the iranologist pierre briant may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the achaemenids
alexander viewed bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him
this campaign initially against bessus turned into a grand tour of central asia
alexander founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate in modern tajikistan
the campaign took alexander through media parthia aria drangiana arachosia bactria and scythia
in bc spitamenes who held an undefined position in the satrapy of sogdiana betrayed bessus to ptolemy one of alexanders trusted companions and bessus was executed
however when at some point later alexander was on the jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army spitamenes raised sogdiana in revolt
alexander personally defeated the scythians at the battle of jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against spitamenes defeating him in the battle of gabai
after the defeat spitamenes was killed by his own men who then sued for peace
during this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis either a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground that persians showed to their social superiors
this was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes
the greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it
this cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it
during the long rule of the achaemenids the elite positions in many segments of the empire including the central government the army and the many satrapies were specifically reserved for iranians and to a major degree persian noblemen
the latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal achaemenid family
this created a problem for alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time
pierre briant explains that alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in asia minor babylonia or egypt he also had to create a central government with or without the support of the iranians
as early as bc he demonstrated awareness of this when he challenged incumbent king darius iii by appropriating the main elements of the achaemenid monarchys ideology particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants
alexander wrote a letter in bc to darius iii wherein he argued that he was worthier than darius to succeed to the achaemenid throne
however alexanders eventual decision to burn the achaemenid palace at persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the entire persian people made it impracticable for him to pose himself as darius legitimate successor
against bessus however briant adds alexander reasserted his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of darius iii
a plot against his life was revealed and one of his officers philotas was executed for failing to alert alexander
the death of the son necessitated the death of the father and thus parmenion who had been charged with guarding the treasury at ecbatana was assassinated at alexanders command to prevent attempts at vengeance
most infamously alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at granicus cleitus the black during a violent drunken altercation at maracanda in which cleitus accused alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially of having forgotten the macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle
later in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life was revealed this one instigated by his own royal pages
his official historian callisthenes of olynthus was implicated in the plot and in the anabasis of alexander arrian states that callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment and likely died soon after
it remains unclear if callisthenes was actually involved in the plot for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis
when alexander set out for asia he left his general antipater an experienced military and political leader and part of philip iis old guard in charge of macedon
alexanders sacking of thebes ensured that greece remained quiet during his absence
the one exception was a call to arms by spartan king agis iii in bc whom antipater defeated and killed in the battle of megalopolis
antipater referred the spartans punishment to the league of corinth which then deferred to alexander who chose to pardon them
there was also considerable friction between antipater and olympias and each complained to alexander about the other
in general greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during alexanders campaign in asia
alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire
however alexanders constant demands for troops and the migration of macedonians throughout his empire depleted macedons strength greatly weakening it in the years after alexander and ultimately led to its subjugation by rome after the third macedonian war
the conquest by philip ii of pangaeum and then of the island of thasos between and bc brought rich gold and silver mines under macedonian control
alexander appears to have introduced a new coinage in cilicia in tarsus after the battle of issus in bc which went on to become the main coinage of the empire
alexander minted gold staters silver tetradrachms and drachims and various fractional bronze coins
the types of these coins remained constant in his empire
the gold series had the head of athena on the obverse and a winged nike on the reverse
the silver coinage had a beardless head of heracles wearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and zeus aetophoros enthroned with a scepter in his left hand on the reverse
there are both greek and non greek aspects to this design
heracles and zeus were important deities for the macedonians with heracles considered to be the ancestor of the temenid dynasty and zeus the patron of the main macedonian sanctuary dium
however the lion was also the symbolic animal of the anatolian god sandas worshipped at tarsus
the reverse design of alexanders tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god baaltars on the silver staters minted at tarsus by the persian satrap mazaeus before alexanders conquest
alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests
persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire
after the death of spitamenes and his marriage to roxana to cement relations with his new satrapies alexander turned to the indian subcontinent
he invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of gandhara to come to him and submit to his authority
omphis the ruler of taxila whose kingdom extended from the indus to the hydaspes complied but the chieftains of some hill clans including the aspasioi and assakenoi sections of the kambojas refused to submit
ambhi hastened to relieve alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents placing himself and all his forces at his disposal
alexander not only returned ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of persian robes gold and silver ornaments horses and talents in gold
alexander was emboldened to divide his forces and ambhi assisted hephaestion and perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the indus where it bends at hund supplied their troops with provisions and received alexander himself and his whole army in his capital city of taxila with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality
on the subsequent advance of the macedonian king taxiles accompanied him with a force of men and took part in the battle of the hydaspes
after that victory he was sent by alexander in pursuit of porus to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy
subsequently however the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of alexander and taxiles after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the hydaspes was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the indus
a considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of philip son of machatas and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of alexander himself as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at triparadisus bc
in the winter of bc alexander personally led a campaign against the aspasioi of the kunar valley the guraeans of the guraeus valley and the assakenoi of the swat and buner valleys
a fierce contest ensued with the aspasioi in which alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the aspasioi lost
alexander then faced the assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of massaga ora and aornos
the fort of massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting in which alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle
according to curtius not only did alexander slaughter the entire population of massaga but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble
a similar slaughter followed at ora
in the aftermath of massaga and ora numerous assakenians fled to the fortress of aornos
alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill fort after four bloody days
after aornos alexander crossed the indus and fought and won an epic battle against king porus who ruled a region lying between the hydaspes and the acesines in what is now the punjab in the battle of the hydaspes in bc
alexander was impressed by poruss bravery and made him an ally
he appointed porus as satrap and added to poruss territory land that he did not previously own towards the south east up to the hyphasis
choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from greece
alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the hydaspes river naming one bucephala in honour of his horse who died around this time
the other was nicaea thought to be located at the site of modern day mong punjab
philostratus the elder in the life of apollonius of tyana writes that in the army of porus there was an elephant who fought brave against alexanders army and alexander dedicated it to the helios and named it ajax because he thought that a so great animal deserved a great name
the elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in greek alexander the son of zeus dedicates ajax to the helios
east of poruss kingdom near the ganges river was the nanda empire of magadha and further east the gangaridai empire of bengal region of the indian subcontinent
fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning alexanders army mutinied at the hyphasis river refusing to march farther east
this river thus marks the easternmost extent of alexanders conquests
alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther but his general coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return the men he said longed to again see their parents their wives and children their homeland
alexander eventually agreed and turned south marching along the indus
along the way his army conquered the malhi and other indian tribes while besieging the mallian citadel alexander suffered a near fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung
alexander sent much of his army to carmania with general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest back to persia through the more difficult southern route along the gedrosian desert and makran
alexander reached susa in bc but not before losing many men to the harsh desert
discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to susa
as a gesture of thanks he paid off the debts of his soldiers and announced that he would send over aged and disabled veterans back to macedon led by craterus
his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis
they refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units
after three days unable to persuade his men to back down alexander gave persians command posts in the army and conferred macedonian military titles upon persian units
the macedonians quickly begged forgiveness which alexander accepted and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men
in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at susa but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year
meanwhile upon his return to persia alexander learned that guards of the tomb of cyrus the great in pasargadae had desecrated it and swiftly executed them
alexander admired cyrus the great from an early age reading xenophons cyropaedia which described cyruss heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator
during his visit to pasargadae alexander ordered his architect aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of cyruss tomb
afterwards alexander travelled to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure
there his closest friend hephaestion died of illness or poisoning
hephaestions death devastated alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in babylon along with a decree for public mourning
back in babylon alexander planned a series of new campaigns beginning with an invasion of arabia but he would not have a chance to realize them as he died shortly after hephaestion
on the evening of may alexander organized a banquet for his army to celebrate the end of the campaign of india and the onset of the invasion of the arabian peninsula
there is a tradition that they would only start serious drinking after everyone was done with their meals but the wine was usually heavily watered
before his death someone asked alexander on who would be his designated successor should he die he responded to the strongest one
he may have also added that there would be funeral games to be played after his death
on either or june bc alexander died in the palace of nebuchadnezzar ii in babylon at age
there are two different versions of alexanders death differing slightly in details
plutarchs account is that roughly days before his death alexander entertained admiral nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with medius of larissa
alexander developed a fever which worsened until he was unable to speak
the common soldiers anxious about his health were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them
in the second account diodorus recounts that alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of heracles followed by days of weakness he did not develop a fever instead dying after some agony
arrian also mentioned this as an alternative but plutarch specifically denied this claim
given the propensity of the macedonian aristocracy to assassination foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death
diodorus plutarch arrian and justin all mentioned the theory that alexander was poisoned
justin stated that alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication while both diodorus and arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness
the accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating antipater recently removed as macedonian viceroy replaced by craterus as the head of the alleged plot
perhaps taking his summons to babylon as a death sentence and having seen the fate of parmenion and philotas antipater purportedly arranged for alexander to be poisoned by his son iollas who was alexanders wine pourer
there was even a suggestion that aristotle may have participated
the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death such long acting poisons were probably not available
however in a bbc documentary investigating the death of alexander leo schep from the new zealand national poisons centre proposed that the plant white hellebore which was known in antiquity may have been used to poison alexander
in a manuscript in the journal clinical toxicology schep suggested alexanders wine was spiked with veratrum album and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the alexander romance
veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if alexander was poisoned veratrum album offers the most plausible cause
another poisoning explanation put forward in proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river styx that contained calicheamicin a dangerous compound produced by bacteria
several natural causes have been suggested including malaria and typhoid fever
a article in the new england journal of medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis
another recent analysis suggested pyogenic spondylitis or meningitis
other illnesses fit the symptoms including acute pancreatitis west nile virus and guillain barr syndrome
natural cause theories also tend to emphasize that alexanders health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds
the anguish that alexander felt after hephaestions death may also have contributed to his declining health
alexanders body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey which was in turn placed in a gold casket
according to aelian a seer called aristander foretold that the land where alexander was laid to rest would be happy and unvanquishable forever
perhaps more likely the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative
while alexanders funeral cortege was on its way to macedon ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to memphis
his successor ptolemy ii philadelphus transferred the sarcophagus to alexandria where it remained until at least late antiquity
ptolemy ix lathyros one of ptolemys final successors replaced alexanders sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage
the recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern greece at amphipolis dating from the time of alexander the great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of alexander
this would fit with the intended destination of alexanders funeral cortege
however the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of alexander the great hephaestion
pompey julius caesar and augustus all visited the tomb in alexandria where augustus allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off
caligula was said to have taken alexanders breastplate from the tomb for his own use
around ad emperor septimius severus closed alexanders tomb to the public
his son and successor caracalla a great admirer visited the tomb during his own reign
after this details on the fate of the tomb are hazy
the so called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeology museum is so named not because it was thought to have contained alexanders remains but because its bas reliefs depict alexander and his companions fighting the persians and hunting
it was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of abdalonymus the king of sidon appointed by alexander immediately following the battle of issus in
however more recently it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than abdalonymuss death
demades likened the macedonian army after the death of alexander to the blinded cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made
in addition leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals after alexanders death to the blinded cyclops who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him not knowing where to lay them
alexanders death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached greece they were not immediately believed
alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir his son alexander iv by roxane being born after alexanders death
according to diodorus alexanders companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom his laconic reply was ti kratisti to the strongest
another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard ti krateri to craterus the general leading his macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of macedonia
arrian and plutarch claimed that alexander was speechless by this point implying that this was an apocryphal story
diodorus curtius and justin offered the more plausible story that alexander passed his signet ring to perdiccas a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry in front of witnesses thereby nominating him
perdiccas initially did not claim power instead suggesting that roxanes baby would be king if male with himself craterus leonnatus and antipater as guardians
however the infantry under the command of meleager rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion
instead they supported alexanders half brother philip arrhidaeus
eventually the two sides reconciled and after the birth of alexander iv he and philip iii were appointed joint kings albeit in name only
dissension and rivalry soon affected the macedonians however
the satrapies handed out by perdiccas at the partition of babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power
after the assassination of perdiccas in bc macedonian unity collapsed and years of war between the successors ensued before the hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs ptolemaic egypt seleucid syria and east and antigonid macedonia
in the process both alexander iv and philip iii were murdered
diodorus stated that alexander had given detailed written instructions to craterus some time before his death which are known as alexanders last plans
craterus started to carry out alexanders commands but the successors chose not to further implement them on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant
furthermore perdiccas had read the notebooks containing alexanders last plans to the macedonian troops in babylon who voted not to carry them out
according to diodorus alexanders last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western mediterranean monumental constructions and the intermixing of eastern and western populations
it included the enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity
ernst badian argued that they were exaggerated by perdiccas in order to ensure that the macedonian troops voted not to carry them out
other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the alexander romance
alexander perhaps earned the epithet the great due to his unparalleled success as a military commander he never lost a battle despite typically being outnumbered
this was due to use of terrain phalanx and cavalry tactics bold strategy and the fierce loyalty of his troops
the macedonian phalanx armed with the sarissa a spear long had been developed and perfected by philip ii through rigorous training and alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate persian forces
alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army which employed various languages and weapons
he overcame this by being personally involved in battle in the manner of a macedonian king
in his first battle in asia at granicus alexander used only a small part of his forces perhaps infantry with cavalry against a much larger persian force of
alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings so that his line matched the length of the persian cavalry line about
by contrast the persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry
this ensured that alexander would not be outflanked while his phalanx armed with long pikes had a considerable advantage over the persians scimitars and javelins
macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the persians
at issus in bc his first confrontation with darius he used the same deployment and again the central phalanx pushed through
alexander personally led the charge in the center routing the opposing army
at the decisive encounter with darius at gaugamela darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes
alexander arranged a double phalanx with the center advancing at an angle parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming
the advance was successful and broke dariuss center causing the latter to flee once again
when faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques such as in central asia and india alexander adapted his forces to his opponents style
thus in bactria and sogdiana alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements while massing his cavalry at the center
in india confronted by poruss elephant corps the macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants handlers
historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of alexanders appearance and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail
during his lifetime alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists of the time
this included commissioning sculptures by lysippos paintings by apelles and gem engravings by pyrgoteles
ancient authors recorded that alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image scholars today however find the claim dubious
nevertheless andrew stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits not least because of who they are commissioned by are always partisan and that artistic portrayals of alexander seek to legitimize him to interpret him to their audiences to answer their critiques and to persuade them of his greatness and thus should be considered within a framework of praise and blame in the same way sources such as praise poetry are
despite those caveats lysipposs sculpture famous for its naturalism as opposed to a stiffer more static pose is thought to be the most faithful depiction
both curtius and diodorus report a story that when darius iiis mother sisygambis first met alexander and hephaestion she assumed that the latter was alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two
details from the alexander sarcophagus show that he had a fair complexion with ruddy cheeks
this is in line with the description of him given by the greek biographer plutarch historians have understood the detail of the pleasant odour attributed to alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes
the alexander mosaic and contemporary coins portray alexander with a straight nose a slightly protruding jaw full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead
the ancient historian aelian in his varia historia describes alexanders hair color as that could mean yellowish reddish or brownish
many scholars and historians attribute heterochromia to him
he is described as having one eye light and one eye dark
in the anabasis of alexander arrian is quoted as saying he had one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky
however some have denied this claim as being used to emphasise the otherworldly and heroic qualities of alexander
reconstruction of the original polychromy of the relief with alexander on the sarcophagus shows him with brown eyes and chestnut brown hair
both of alexanders parents encouraged his ambitions
his father philip was probably alexanders most immediate and influential role model as the young alexander watched him campaign practically every year winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds
alexanders relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality he had a need to outdo his father illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle
while alexander worried that his father would leave him no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world he also downplayed his fathers achievements to his companions
alexanders mother olympia similarly had huge ambitions and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the persian empire
she instilled a sense of destiny in him and plutarch tells how his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years
according to plutarch alexander also had a violent temper and rash impulsive nature and this could influence his decision making
although alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father he was open to reasoned debate
he had a calmer side perceptive logical and calculating
he had a great desire for knowledge a love for philosophy and was an avid reader
this was no doubt in part due to aristotles tutelage alexander was intelligent and quick to learn
his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general
he had great self restraint in pleasures of the body in contrast with his lack of self control with alcohol
alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences
however he had little interest in sports or the olympic games seeking only the homeric ideals of honour and glory
he had great charisma and force of personality characteristics which made him a great leader
his unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite macedonia and retain the empire after his death only alexander had the ability to do so
during his final years and especially after the death of hephaestion alexander began to exhibit signs of and paranoia
his extraordinary achievements coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions may have combined to produce this effect
his delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition an epithet the meaning of which has descended into a historical clich
he appears to have believed himself a deity or at least sought to deify himself
olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of zeus a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of amun at siwa
he began to identify himself as the son of zeus ammon
alexander adopted elements of persian dress and customs at court notably proskynesis which was one aspect of alexanders broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the iranian upper classes however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the macedonians and they were unwilling to perform it
this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen
however alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine
thus rather than megalomania his behaviour may have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together
alexander married three times roxana daughter of the sogdian nobleman oxyartes of bactria out of love and the persian princesses stateira and parysatis the former a daughter of darius iii and the latter a daughter of artaxerxes iii for political reasons
he apparently had two sons alexander iv of macedon by roxana and possibly heracles of macedon from his mistress barsine
he lost another child when roxana miscarried at babylon
alexander also had a close relationship with his friend general and bodyguard hephaestion the son of a macedonian noble
hephaestions death devastated alexander
this event may have contributed to alexanders failing health and detached mental state during his final months
alexanders sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times
the roman era writer athenaeus says based on the scholar dicaearchus who was alexanders contemporary that the king was quite excessively keen on boys and that alexander kissed the eunuch bagoas in public
this episode is also told by plutarch probably based on the same source
none of alexanders contemporaries however are known to have explicitly described alexanders relationship with hephaestion as sexual though the pair was often compared to achilles and patroclus whom classical greek culture painted as a couple
aelian writes of alexanders visit to troy where alexander garlanded the tomb of achilles and hephaestion that of patroclus the latter hinting that he was a beloved of alexander in just the same way as patroclus was of achilles
some modern historians believe not only that alexanders youthful relationship with hephaestion was sexual but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood which went against the social norms of at least some greek cities such as athens though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that macedonia may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults
green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that alexander had much carnal interest in women he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life
however ogden calculates that alexander who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age
two of these pregnancies stateiras and barsines are of dubious legitimacy
according to diodorus siculus alexander accumulated a harem in the style of persian kings but he used it rather sparingly not wishing to offend the macedonians showing great self control in pleasures of the body
nevertheless plutarch described how alexander was infatuated by roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her
green suggested that in the context of the period alexander formed quite strong friendships with women including ada of caria who adopted him and even dariuss mother sisygambis who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of alexanders death
alexanders legacy extended beyond his military conquests and his reign marked a turning point in european and asian history
his campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between east and west and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to greek civilization and influence
some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers many surviving into the st century
his chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched while the greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the mediterranean
alexanders most immediate legacy was the introduction of macedonian rule to huge new swathes of asia
at the time of his death alexanders empire covered some and was the largest state of its time
many of these areas remained in macedonian hands or under greek influence for the next years
the successor states that emerged were at least initially dominant forces and these years are often referred to as the hellenistic period
the eastern borders of alexanders empire began to collapse even during his lifetime
however the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful indian dynasties in history the maurya empire
taking advantage of this power vacuum chandragupta maurya of relatively humble origin took control of the punjab and with that power base proceeded to conquer the nanda empire
over the course of his conquests alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name most of them east of the tigris
the first and greatest was alexandria in egypt which would become one of the leading mediterranean cities
the cities locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions
at first the cities must have been inhospitable little more than defensive garrisons
following alexanders death many greeks who had settled there tried to return to greece
however a century or so after alexanders death many of the alexandrias were thriving with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both greek and local peoples
the foundation of the new smyrna was also associated with alexander
according to the legend after alexander hunted on the mount pagus he slept under a plane tree at the sanctuary of nemesis
while he was sleeping the goddess appeared and told him to found a city there and move into it the smyrnaeans from the old city
the smyrnaeans sent ambassadors to the oracle at clarus to ask about this and after the response from the oracle they decided to move to the new city
the city of pella in modern jordan was founded by veterans of alexanders army and named it after the city of pella in greece which was the birthplace of alexander
in bc alexander the great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of athena polias in priene in modern day western turkey
an inscription from the temple now housed in the british museum declares king alexander dedicated temple to athena polias
this inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from alexanders life
the temple was designed by pytheos one of the architects of the mausoleum at halicarnassus
libanius wrote that alexander founded the temple of zeus bottiaios in the place where later the city of antioch was built
suda wrote that alexander built a big temple to sarapis
hellenization was coined by the german historian johann gustav droysen to denote the spread of greek language culture and population into the former persian empire after alexanders conquest
this process can be seen in such great hellenistic cities as alexandria antioch and seleucia
alexander sought to insert greek elements into persian culture and to hybridize greek and persian culture homogenizing the populations of asia and europe
although his successors explicitly rejected such policies hellenization occurred throughout the region accompanied by a distinct and opposite orientalization of the successor states
the core of the hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially athenian
the close association of men from across greece in alexanders army directly led to the emergence of the largely attic based koine or common greek dialect
koine spread throughout the hellenistic world becoming the lingua franca of hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern greek
furthermore town planning education local government and art current in the hellenistic period were all based on classical greek ideals evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as hellenistic
also the new testament was written in the koine greek language
aspects of hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the byzantine empire in the mid th century
some of the most pronounced effects of hellenization can be seen in afghanistan and india in the region of the relatively late rising greco bactrian kingdom and the indo greek kingdom in modern afghanistan and india
on the silk road trade routes hellenistic culture hybridized with iranian and buddhist cultures
the cosmopolitan art and mythology of gandhara of the rd century bc to the th century ad are most evident of the direct contact between hellenistic civilization and south asia as are the edicts of ashoka which directly mention the greeks within ashokas dominion as converting to buddhism and the reception of buddhist emissaries by ashokas contemporaries in the hellenistic world
the resulting syncretism known as greco buddhism influenced the development of buddhism and created a culture of greco buddhist art
these greco buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first buddhist missionaries to china sri lanka and hellenistic asia and europe
some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the buddha appeared at this time perhaps modelled on greek statues of apollo in the greco buddhist style
several buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient greek religion the concept of boddhisatvas is reminiscent of greek divine heroes and some mahayana ceremonial practices are similar to those practised by the ancient greeks however similar practices were also observed amongst the native indic culture
one greek king menander i probably became buddhist and was immortalized in buddhist literature as milinda
the process of hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west
for example greek astronomical instruments dating to the rd century bc were found in the greco bactrian city of ai khanoum in modern day afghanistan while the greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long standing indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain like the petals of a flower
the yavanajataka and paulisa siddhanta texts depict the influence of greek astronomical ideas on indian astronomy
following the conquests of alexander the great in the east hellenistic influence on indian art was far ranging
in the area of architecture a few examples of the ionic order can be found as far as pakistan with the jandial temple near taxila
several examples of capitals displaying ionic influences can be seen as far as patna especially with the pataliputra capital dated to the rd century bc
the corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of gandhara especially through indo corinthian capitals
alexander and his exploits were admired by many romans especially generals who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements
polybius began his histories by reminding romans of alexanders achievements and thereafter roman leaders saw him as a role model
pompey the great adopted the epithet magnus and even alexanders anastole type haircut and searched the conquered lands of the east for alexanders year old cloak which he then wore as a sign of greatness
julius caesar dedicated a lysippean equestrian bronze statue but replaced alexanders head with his own while octavian visited alexanders tomb in alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to alexanders profile
the emperor trajan also admired alexander as did nero and caracalla
the macriani a roman family that in the person of macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne kept images of alexander on their persons either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes
on the other hand some roman writers particularly republican figures used alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values
alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as and but also and
emperor julian in his satire called the caesars describes a contest between the previous roman emperors with alexander the great called in as an extra contestant in the presence of the assembled gods
the itinerarium alexandri is a th century latin itinerarium which describes alexander the greats campaigns
julius caesar went to serve his quaestorship in hispania after his wifes funeral in the spring or early summer of bc
while there he encountered a statue of alexander the great and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when alexander had the world at his feet while he had achieved comparatively little
pompey posed as the new alexander since he was his boyhood hero
after caracalla concluded his campaign against the alamanni it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with alexander the great
he began openly mimicking alexander in his personal style
in planning his invasion of the parthian empire caracalla decided to arrange of his men in macedonian style phalanxes despite the roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation
the historian christopher matthew mentions that the term phalangarii has two possible meanings both with military connotations
the first refers merely to the roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes and the second bears similarity to the marian mules of the late roman republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole which were in use until at least the nd century ad
as a consequence the phalangarii of legio ii parthica may not have been pikemen but rather standard battle line troops or possibly triarii
caracallas mania for alexander went so far that caracalla visited alexandria while preparing for his persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the aristotelian school based on a legend that aristotle had poisoned alexander
this was a sign of caracallas increasingly erratic behaviour
but this mania for alexander strange as it was was overshadowed by subsequent events in alexandria
in caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons stretching for over two miles from the resort of baiae to the neighbouring port of puteoli
it was said that the bridge was to rival the persian king xerxes pontoon bridge crossing of the hellespont
caligula who could not swim then proceeded to ride his favourite horse incitatus across wearing the breastplate of alexander the great
this act was in defiance of a prediction by tiberiuss soothsayer thrasyllus of mendes that caligula had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the bay of baiae
the diffusion of greek culture and language cemented by alexanders conquests in west asia and north africa served as a precondition for the later roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the byzantine empire according to errington
alexander wrote and received numerous letters but no originals survive
a few official letters addressed to the greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources
these only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are
several fictitious letters some perhaps based on actual letters made their way into the romance tradition
many of the legends about alexander derive from his own lifetime probably encouraged by alexander himself
his court historian callisthenes portrayed the sea in cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis
writing shortly after alexanders death onesicritus invented a tryst between alexander and thalestris queen of the mythical amazons
he reportedly read this passage to his patron king lysimachus who had been one of alexanders generals and who quipped i wonder where i was at the time
in the first centuries after alexanders death probably in alexandria a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the alexander romance later falsely ascribed to callisthenes and therefore known as pseudo callisthenes
this text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout antiquity and the middle ages containing many dubious stories and was translated into numerous languages for example middle persian syriac and probably arabic
alexander the greats accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures
alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day
the alexander romance in particular has had a significant impact on portrayals of alexander in later cultures from persian to medieval european to modern greek
alexander features prominently in modern greek folklore more so than any other ancient figure
the colloquial form of his name in modern greek is a household name and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the karagiozis shadow play
one well known fable among greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ships prow during a storm and ask the captain is king alexander alive the correct answer is he is alive and well and rules the world causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm
any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea all hands aboard
in pre islamic middle persian literature alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak meaning accursed and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of zoroastrianism
in islamic persia under the influence of the alexander romance a more positive portrayal of alexander emerges
firdausis shahnameh includes alexander in a line of legitimate persian shahs a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the fountain of youth
in the shahnameh alexanders first journey is to mecca to pray at the kaaba
alexander was depicted as performing a hajj many times in subsequent islamic art and literature
later persian writers associate him with philosophy portraying him at a symposium with figures such as socrates plato and aristotle in search of immortality
the figure of dhu al qarnayn mentioned in the quran is believed by scholars to be based on later legends of alexander
in this tradition he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of gog and magog
he then travelled the known world in search of the water of life and immortality eventually becoming a prophet
the majority of modern researchers of the quran as well as islamic commentators identify dhu al qarnayn as alexander the great
the syriac version of the alexander romance portrays him as an ideal christian world conqueror who prayed to the one true god
in egypt alexander was portrayed as the son of nectanebo ii the last pharaoh before the persian conquest
his defeat of darius was depicted as egypts salvation proving egypt was still ruled by an egyptian
according to josephus alexander was shown the book of daniel when he entered jerusalem which described a mighty greek king who would conquer the persian empire
this is cited as a reason for sparing jerusalem
in hindi and urdu the name sikandar derived from the persian name for alexander denotes a rising young talent and the delhi sultanate ruler aladdin khalji stylized himself as sikandar i sani
in medieval india turkic and afghan sovereigns from the iranian cultured region of central asia brought positive cultural connotations of alexander to the indian subcontinent resulting in the efflorescence of sikandernameh written by indo persian poets such as amir khusrow and the prominence of alexander the great as a popular subject in mughal era persian miniatures
in medieval europe alexander the great was revered as a member of the nine worthies a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry
during the first italian campaign of the french revolutionary wars in a question from bourrienne asking whether he gave his preference to alexander or caesar napoleon said that he places alexander the great in the first rank the main reason being his campaign on asia
in the greek anthology there are poems referring to alexander
throughout time art objects related to alexander were being created
in addition to speech works sculptures and paintings in modern times alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works
the song alexander the great by the british heavy metal band iron maiden is indicative
some films that have been shot with the theme of alexander are there are also many references to other movies and tv series
the trilogy alexander the great by valerio massimo manfredi consisting of the son of the dream the sand of amon and the ends of the world
the trilogy of mary renault consisting of fire from heaven the persian boy and funeral games
irish playwright aubrey thomas de vere wrote alexander the great a dramatic poem
apart from a few inscriptions and fragments texts written by people who actually knew alexander or who gathered information from men who served with alexander were all lost
contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included alexanders campaign historian callisthenes alexanders generals ptolemy and nearchus aristobulus a junior officer on the campaigns and onesicritus alexanders chief helmsman
their works are lost but later works based on these original sources have survived
the earliest of these is diodorus siculus followed by quintus curtius rufus arrian the biographer plutarch and finally justin whose work dated as late as the th century
of these arrian is generally considered the most reliable given that he used ptolemy and aristobulus as his sources closely followed by diodorus
alfred habdank skarbek korzybski was a polish american independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics which he viewed as both distinct from and more encompassing than the field of semantics
he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed and thus no one can have direct access to reality given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brains responses to reality
his best known dictum is the map is not the territory
born in warsaw vistula country which was then part of the russian empire korzybski belonged to an aristocratic polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians scientists and engineers for generations
he learned the polish language at home and the russian language in schools and having a french and german governess he became fluent in four languages as a child
korzybski studied engineering at the warsaw university of technology
during the first world war korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the russian army
after being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries he moved to north america in to coordinate the shipment of artillery to russia
he also lectured to polish american audiences about the conflict promoting the sale of war bonds
after the war he decided to remain in the united states becoming a naturalized citizen in
he met mira edgerly a painter of portraits on ivory shortly after the armistice they married in january the marriage lasted until his death
dutton published korzybskis first book manhood of humanity in
in this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind mankind as a time binding class of life
korzybskis work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics
this should not be confused with semantics
the basic principles of general semantics which include time binding are described in the publication science and sanity published in
in korzybski founded the institute of general semantics in chicago
the post world war ii housing shortage in chicago cost him the institutes building lease so in he moved the institute to lakeville connecticut us where he directed it until his death in
korzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by the structure of their nervous systems and the structure of their languages
humans cannot experience the world directly but only through their abstractions
these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth
our understanding sometimes lacks similarity of structure with what is actually happening
he sought to train our awareness of abstracting using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science
he called this awareness this goal of his system consciousness of abstracting
his system included the promotion of attitudes such as i dont know lets see in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science
another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet an experience he termed silence on the objective levels
many devotees and critics of korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form is of the general verb to be
his system however is based primarily on such terminology as the different orders of abstraction and formulations such as consciousness of abstracting
the contention that korzybski opposed the use of the verb to be would be a profound exaggeration
he thought that certain uses of the verb to be called the is of identity and the is of predication were faulty in structure eg a statement such as elizabeth is a fool
in korzybskis system ones assessment of elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than elizabeth herself
korzybskis remedy was to deny identity in this example to be aware continually that elizabeth is not what we call her
we find elizabeth not in the verbal domain the world of words but the nonverbal domain
this was expressed by korzybskis most famous premise the map is not the territory
note that this premise uses the phrase is not a form of to be this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon to be as such
in fact he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb to be when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location
it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb to be as long as one was aware of their structural limitations
one day korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits wrapped in white paper from his briefcase
he muttered that he just had to eat something and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit
a few students took a biscuit
nice biscuit dont you think said korzybski while he took a second one
the students were chewing vigorously
then he tore the white paper from the biscuits in order to reveal the original packaging
on it was a big picture of a dogs head and the words dog cookies
the students looked at the package and were shocked
two of them wanted to vomit put their hands in front of their mouths and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet
you see korzybski remarked i have just demonstrated that people dont just eat food but also words and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter
william burroughs went to a korzybski workshop in the autumn of
he was years old and paid
his fellow students there were in all included young samuel i
hayakawa and wendell johnson
korzybski was well received in numerous disciplines as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the s and s
these include author robert a
heinlein naming a character after him in his short story blowups happen and science fiction writer a
van vogt in his novel the world of null a published in
korzybskis ideas influenced philosopher alan watts who used his phrase the map is not the territory in lectures
writer robert anton wilson was also deeply influenced by korzybskis ideas
as reported in the third edition of science and sanity in world war ii the us army used korzybskis system to treat battle fatigue in europe under the supervision of dr douglas m
kelley who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the nazi war criminals at nuremberg
some of the general semantics tradition was continued by samuel i
asteroids is a space themed multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by lyle rains and ed logg released in november by atari inc
the player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers
the object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers counter fire
the game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases
asteroids was conceived during a meeting between logg and rains who decided to use hardware developed by howard delman previously used for lunar lander
asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled cosmos its physics model control scheme and gameplay elements were derived from spacewar computer space and space invaders and refined through trial and error
the game is rendered on a vector display in a two dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes
asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games the game sold upright cabinets and cocktail cabinets arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers
in the s it was ported to ataris home systems and the atari vcs version sold over three million copies
the game was widely imitated and it directly influenced defender gravitar and many other video games
the objective of asteroids is to destroy asteroids and saucers
the player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right fire shots straight forward and thrust forward
once the ship begins moving in a direction it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction
the ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting
the player can also send the ship into hyperspace causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen at the risk of self destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid
each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen
objects wrap around screen edges for instance an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction
as the player shoots asteroids they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit
smaller asteroids are also worth more points
two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen the big saucer shoots randomly and poorly while the small saucer fires frequently at the ship
after reaching a score of only the small saucer appears
as the players score increases the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately
once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers a new set of large asteroids appears thus starting the next level
the game gets harder as the number of asteroids increases until after the score reaches a range between and
the player starts with lives upon game start and gains an extra life per points
play continues to the last ship lost which ends the game
the machine turns over at points which is the maximum high score that can be achieved
in the original game design saucers were supposed to begin shooting as soon as they appeared but this was changed
additionally saucers can only aim at the players ship on screen they are not capable of aiming across a screen boundary
these behaviors allow a lurking strategy in which the player stays near the edge of the screen opposite the saucer
by keeping just one or two rocks in play a player can shoot across the boundary and destroy saucers to accumulate points indefinitely with little risk of being destroyed
arcade operators began to complain about losing revenue due to this exploit
in response atari issued a patched eprom and due to the impact of this exploit atari changed their development and testing policies to try to prevent future games from having such exploits
asteroids was conceived by lyle rains and programmed by ed logg with collaborations from other atari staff
logg was impressed with the atari video computer system and he joined ataris coin op division to work on dirt bike which was never released due to an unsuccessful field test
paul mancuso joined the development team as asteroids technician and engineer howard delman contributed to the hardware
during a meeting in april rains discussed planet grab a multiplayer arcade game later renamed to cosmos
logg did not know the name of the game thinking computer space as the inspiration for the two dimensional approach
rains conceived of asteroids as a mixture of computer space and space invaders combining the two dimensional approach of computer space with space invaders addictive gameplay of completion and eliminate all threats
the unfinished game featured a giant indestructible asteroid so rains asked logg well why dont we have a game where you shoot the rocks and blow them up in response logg described a similar concept where the player selectively shoots at rocks that break into smaller pieces
both agreed on the concept
asteroids was implemented on hardware developed by delman and is a vector game in which the graphics are composed of lines drawn on a vector monitor
rains initially wanted the game done in raster graphics but logg experienced in vector graphics suggested an xy monitor because the high image quality would permit precise aiming
the hardware is chiefly a mos executing the game program and quadrascan a high resolution vector graphics processor developed by atari and referred to as an xy display system and the digital vector generator
the original design concepts for quadrascan came out of cyan engineering ataris off campus research lab in grass valley california in
cyan gave it to delman who finished the design and first used it for lunar lander
logg received delmans modified board with five buttons sound effects and additional ram and he used it to develop asteroids
the size of the board was by inches and it was linked up to a monitor
logg modeled the players ship the five button control scheme and the game physics after spacewar which he had played as a student at the university of california berkeley but made several changes to improve playability
the ship was programmed into the hardware and rendered by the monitor and it was configured to move with thrust and inertia
the hyperspace button was not placed near loggs right thumb which he was dissatisfied with as he had a problem tak his hand off the thrust button
drawings of asteroids in various shapes were incorporated into the game
logg copied the idea of a high score table with initials from exidys star fire
the two saucers were formulated to be different from each other
a steadily decreasing timer shortens intervals between saucer attacks to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers
a heartbeat soundtrack quickens as the game progresses
the game does not have a sound chip
delman created a hardware circuit for sound effects by hand which was wired onto the board
a prototype of asteroids was well received by several atari staff and engineers who wander between labs passing comment and stopping to play as they went
logg was often asked when he would be leaving by employees eager to play the prototype so he created a second prototype for staff to play
atari tested the game in arcades in sacramento california and also observed players during focus group sessions at atari
players used to spacewar struggled to maintain grip on the thrust button and requested a joystick players accustomed to space invaders noted they get no break in the game
logg and other engineers observed proceedings and documented comments in four pages
asteroids slows down as the player gains lives because there is no limit to the number of lives displayed
the player can lose the game after more than lives are collected
asteroids was released for the atari vcs and atari bit family in then the atari in
a port for the atari identical to the atari bit computer version was in development in but was not published
the atari version was a launch title and includes cooperative play the asteroids have colorful textures and the heartbeat sound effect remains intact
programmers brad stewart and bob smith were unable to fit the atari vcs port into a kb cartridge
it became the first game for the console to use bank switching a technique that increases rom size from kb to kb
asteroids was immediately successful upon release
it displaced space invaders by popularity in the united states and became ataris best selling arcade game of all time with over units sold
atari earned an estimated million in sales from the game and arcade operators earned a further million from coin drops
atari had been in the process of manufacturing another vector game lunar lander but demand for asteroids was so high that several hundred asteroids games were shipped in lunar lander cabinets
asteroids was so popular that some video arcade operators had to install large boxes to hold the number of coins spent by players
it replaced space invaders at the top of the us replay amusement arcade charts in april though space invaders remained the top game at street locations
asteroids went on to become the highest grossing arcade video game of in the united states dethroning space invaders
it shipped arcade units worldwide in including over sold in the united states that year and grossed about worldwide by
the game remained at the top of the us replay charts through march
however the game did not perform as well overseas in europe and asia
it sold arcade units overseas for a total of arcade units sold worldwide
atari manufactured units from its us and ireland plants including asteroids deluxe units
it was a commercial failure in japan when it released there in partly due to its complex controls and partly due to the japanese market beginning to lose interest in space shoot em ups at the time
asteroids received positive reviews from video game critics and has been regarded as loggs magnum opus
richard a
edwards reviewed the asteroids home cartridge in the space gamer no
edwards commented that this home cartridge is a virtual duplicate of the ever popular atari arcade game
if blasting asteroids is the thing you want to do then this is the game but at this price i cant wholeheartedly recommend it
video games player magazine reviewed the atari vcs version rating the graphics and sound a b while giving the game an overall b rating
electronic fun with computers games magazine gave the atari vcs version an a rating
william cassidy writing for gamespys classic gaming noticed its innovations including being one of the first video games to track initials and allow players to enter their initials for appearing in the top high scores and commented the vector graphics fit the futuristic outer space theme very well
in flux magazine ranked the arcade version th on their top video games
in next generation listed it as number on their top games of all time particularly lauding the control dynamics which require the constant juggling of speed positioning and direction
in next generation listed asteroids as number on their top games of all time commenting that asteroids was a classic the day it was released and it has never lost any of its appeal
asteroids was ranked fourth on retro gamers list of top arcade games the retro gamer staff cited its simplicity and the lack of a proper ending as allowances of revisiting the game
in asteroids was listed on time all time greatest video games list
entertainment weekly named asteroids one of the top ten games for the atari in
it was added to the museum of modern arts collection of video games
in the guardian listed asteroids as the second greatest video game of the s just below galaxian
by contrast in march the atari bit port of asteroids won sixth place in softlines dog of the year awards for badness in computer games atari division based on reader submissions
usage of the names of saturday night live characters mr bill and sluggo to refer to the saucers in an esquire article about the game led to logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a lawyer with the mr bill trademark
released in asteroids deluxe was the first sequel to asteroids
dave shepperd edited the code and made enhancements to the game without loggs involvement
the onscreen objects are tinted blue and hyperspace is replaced by a shield that depletes when used
the asteroids rotate and new killer satellite enemies break into smaller ships that home in on the players position
the arcade machines monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop
the game is more difficult than the original and enables saucers to shoot across the screen boundary eliminating the lurking strategy for high scores in the original
space duel released in arcades in replaces the rocks with colorful geometric shapes and adds cooperative two player gameplay
s blasteroids includes power ups ship morphing branching levels bosses and the ability to dock your ships in multiplayer for added firepower
blasteroids uses raster graphics instead of vectors

asparagales is an order of plants in modern classification systems such as the angiosperm phylogeny group and the angiosperm phylogeny web
the order takes its name from the type family asparagaceae and is placed in the monocots amongst the lilioid monocots
the order has only recently been recognized in classification systems
it was first put forward by huber in and later taken up in the dahlgren system of and then the apg in and
before this many of its families were assigned to the old order liliales a very large order containing almost all monocots with colorful tepals and lacking starch in their endosperm
dna sequence analysis indicated that many of the taxa previously included in liliales should actually be redistributed over three orders liliales asparagales and dioscoreales
the boundaries of the asparagales and of its families have undergone a series of changes in recent years future research may lead to further changes and ultimately greater stability
in the apg circumscription asparagales is the largest order of monocots with families genera and about species
the order is clearly circumscribed on the basis of molecular phylogenetics but it is difficult to define morphologically since its members are structurally diverse
most species of asparagales are herbaceous perennials although some are climbers and some are tree like
the order also contains many geophytes
according to telomere sequence at least two evolutionary switch points happened within the order
the basal sequence is formed by tttaggg like in the majority of higher plants
basal motif was changed to vertebrate like ttaggg and finally the most divergent motif ctcggttatggg appears in allium
one of the defining characteristics of the order is the presence of phytomelanin a black pigment present in the seed coat creating a dark crust
phytomelanin is found in most families of the asparagales
the leaves of almost all species form a tight rosette either at the base of the plant or at the end of the stem but occasionally along the stem
the flowers are not particularly distinctive being lily type with six tepals and up to six stamina
the order is thought to have first diverged from other related monocots some million years ago although given the difficulty in classifying the families involved estimates are likely to be uncertain
from an economic point of view the order asparagales is second in importance within the monocots only to the order poales
species are used as food and flavourings in medicinal or cosmetic applications as cut flowers and as garden ornamentals
although most species in the order are herbaceous some no more than cm high there are a number of climbers as well as several genera forming trees which can exceed m in height
succulent genera occur in several families
almost all species have a tight cluster of leaves either at the base of the plant or at the end of a more or less woody stem as with yucca
in some cases the leaves are produced along the stem
the flowers are in the main not particularly distinctive being of a general lily type with six tepals either free or fused from the base and up to six stamina
they are frequently clustered at the end of the plant stem
the asparagales are generally distinguished from the liliales by the lack of markings on the tepals the presence of septal nectaries in the ovaries rather than the bases of the tepals or stamen filaments and the presence of secondary growth
they are generally geophytes but with linear leaves and a lack of fine reticular venation
the seeds characteristically have the external epidermis either obliterated or if present have a layer of black carbonaceous phytomelanin in species with dry fruits
the inner part of the seed coat is generally collapsed in contrast to liliales whose seeds have a well developed outer epidermis lack phytomelanin and usually display a cellular inner layer
the orders which have been separated from the old liliales are difficult to characterize
no single morphological character appears to be diagnostic of the order asparagales
as circumscribed within the angiosperm phylogeny group system asparagales is the largest order within the monocotyledons with families genera and about species thus accounting for about of all monocots and of the flowering plants
the attribution of botanical authority for the name asparagales belongs to johann heinrich friedrich link who coined the word asparaginae in for a higher order taxon that included asparagus although adanson and jussieau had also done so earlier
earlier circumscriptions of asparagales attributed the name to bromhead who had been the first to use the term asparagales
the type genus asparagus from which the name of the order is derived was described by carl linnaeus in with ten species
he placed asparagus within the hexandria monogynia in his sexual classification in the species plantarum
the majority of taxa now considered to constitute asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family liliaceae
the family liliaceae was first described by michel adanson in and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it including the asparagi with asparagus and three other genera
the system of organising genera into families is generally credited to antoine laurent de jussieu who formally described both the liliaceae and the type family of asparagales the asparagaceae as lilia and asparagi respectively in
jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy placing asparagus and related genera within a division of monocotyledons a class of stamina perigynia and order asparagi divided into three subfamilies
the use of the term ordo at that time was closer to what we now understand as family rather than order
in creating his scheme he used a modified form of linnaeus sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers
while de jussieus stamina perigynia also included a number of orders that would eventually form families within the asparagales such as the asphodeli narcissi and irides the remainder are now allocated to other orders
jussieus asparagi soon came to be referred to as asparagaces in the french literature
meanwhile the narcissi had been renamed as the amaryllides in by jean henri jaume saint hilaire using amaryllis as the type species rather than narcissus and thus has the authority attribution for amaryllidaceae
in brown proposed that a subgroup of liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the ovaries and be referred to as amaryllideae and in de candolle described liliaces juss
and amaryllides brown as two quite separate families
the literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the english language with samuel frederick grays a natural arrangement of british plants
gray used a combination of linnaeus sexual classification and jussieus natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid but did not use formal names for these higher ranks
within the grouping he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed
he treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families such as amaryllideae liliaceae asphodeleae and asparageae
the circumscription of asparagales has been a source of difficulty for many botanists from the time of john lindley the other important british taxonomist of the early nineteenth century
in his first taxonomic work an introduction to the natural system of botany he partly followed jussieu by describing a subclass he called endogenae or monocotyledonous plants divided into two tribes the petaloidea and glumaceae
he divided the former often referred to as petaloid monocots into orders including the liliaceae but also most of the families considered to make up the asparagales today including the amaryllideae
by in his final scheme lindley had greatly expanded and refined the treatment of the monocots introducing both an intermediate ranking and tribes within orders
lindley placed the liliaceae within the liliales but saw it as a paraphyletic family being all liliales not included in the other orders but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better
the order liliales was very large and had become a used to include almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm
the liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups
this kept the liliaceae separate from the amaryllidaceae
of these liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes and amaryllidaceae into four tribes yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each others contemporary orders
the liliaceae would be reduced to a small core represented by the tribe tulipae while large groups such scilleae and asparagae would become part of asparagales either as part of the amaryllidaceae or as separate families
while of the amaryllidaceae the agaveae would be part of asparagaceae but the alstroemeriae would become a family within the liliales
the number of known genera continued to grow and by the time of the next major british classification that of the bentham hooker system in several of lindleys other families had been absorbed into the liliaceae
they used the term series to indicate suprafamilial rank with seven series of monocotyledons but did not use lindleys terms for these
however they did place the liliaceous and amaryllidaceous genera into separate series
the liliaceae were placed in series coronariae while the amaryllideae were placed in series epigynae
the liliaceae now consisted of twenty tribes and the amaryllideae of five
an important addition to the treatment of the liliaceae was the recognition of the allieae as a distinct tribe that would eventually find its way to the asparagales as the subfamily allioideae of the amaryllidaceae
the appearance of charles darwins origin of species in changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata
the darwinian approach led to the concept of phylogeny in assembling classification systems starting with eichler
eichler having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons further divided into former into seven orders
within the liliiflorae were seven families including liliaceae and amaryllidaceae
liliaceae included allium and ornithogalum and asparagus
engler in his system developed eichlers ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated in a number of works including die natrlichen pflanzenfamilien and syllabus der pflanzenfamilien
in his treatment of liliiflorae the liliineae were a suborder which included both families liliaceae and amaryllidaceae
the liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the amaryllidaceae four
in this rearrangement of liliaceae with fewer subdivisions the core liliales were represented as subfamily lilioideae the asparagae were represented as asparagoideae and the allioideae was preserved representing the alliaceous genera
allieae agapantheae and gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily
in the amaryllidacea there was little change from the bentham hooker
a similar approach was adopted by wettstein
in the twentieth century the wettstein system placed many of the taxa in an order called liliiflorae
next johannes paulus lotsy proposed dividing the liliiflorae into a number of smaller families including asparagaceae
then herbert huber following lotsys example proposed that the liliiflorae be split into four groups including the asparagoid liliiflorae
the widely used cronquist system used the very broadly defined order liliales
these various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact till that of dahlgren incorporating new information including synapomorphy
dahlgren developed hubers ideas further and popularised them with a major deconstruction of existing families into smaller units
they created a new order calling it asparagales
this was one of five orders within the superorder liliiflorae
where cronquist saw one family dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders
over the s in the context of a more general review of the classification of angiosperms the liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny
by the end of that decade the royal botanic gardens at kew the british museum of natural history and the edinburgh botanical gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria
that committee finally recommended that new families be created in the place of the original broad liliaceae largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families
the order asparagales as currently circumscribed has only recently been recognized in classification systems through the advent of phylogenetics
the s saw considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabling a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants
the establishment of major new clades necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as cronquist and thorne based largely on morphology rather than genetic data
this complicated discussion about plant evolution and necessitated a major restructuring
rbcl gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots had redefined the liliales in
from four morphological orders sensu dahlgren
the largest clade representing the liliaceae all previously included in liliales but including both the calochortaceae and liliaceae sensu tamura
this redefined family that became referred to as core liliales but corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the angiosperm phylogeny group
the revision of the angiosperm phylogeny group system apg iii places the order in the clade monocots
from the dahlgren system of onwards studies based mainly on morphology had identified the asparagales as a distinct group but had also included groups now located in liliales pandanales and zingiberales
research in the st century has supported the monophyly of asparagales based on morphology s rdna and other dna sequences although some phylogenetic reconstructions based on molecular data have suggested that asparagales may be paraphyletic with orchidaceae separated from the rest
within the monocots asparagales is the sister group of the commelinid clade
this cladogram shows the placement of asparagales within the orders of lilianae sensu chase reveal based on molecular phylogenetic evidence
the lilioid monocot orders are bracketed namely petrosaviales dioscoreales pandanales liliales and asparagales
these constitute a paraphyletic assemblage that is groups with a common ancestor that do not include all direct descendants to form a clade all the groups joined by thick lines would need to be included
while acorales and alismatales have been collectively referred to as alismatid monocots the remaining clades have been referred to as the core monocots
the relationship between the orders is that is diverging in succession from the line that leads to the commelinids
numbers indicate crown group divergence times in mya
a phylogenetic tree for the asparagales generally to family level but including groups which were recently and widely treated as families but which are now reduced to subfamily rank is shown below
the tree shown above can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group the lower asparagales from orchidaceae to asphodelaceae and a well supported monophyletic group of core asparagales comprising the two largest families amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato
two differences between these two groups are the mode of microsporogenesis and the position of the ovary
the lower asparagales typically have simultaneous microsporogenesis which appears to be an apomorphy within the monocots whereas the core asparagales have reverted to successive microsporogenesis
the lower asparagales typically have an inferior ovary whereas the core asparagales have reverted to a superior ovary
a morphological study by rudall treated possessing an inferior ovary as a synapomorphy of the asparagales stating that reversions to a superior ovary in the core asparagales could be associated with the presence of nectaries below the ovaries
however stevens notes that superior ovaries are distributed among the lower asparagales in such a way that it is not clear where to place the evolution of different ovary morphologies
the position of the ovary seems a much more flexible character than previously thought
the apg iii system when it was published in greatly expanded the families xanthorrhoeaceae amaryllidaceae and asparagaceae
thirteen of the families of the earlier apg ii system were thereby reduced to subfamilies within these three families
the expanded xanthorrhoeaceae is now called asphodelaceae
the apg ii families and their equivalent apg iii subfamilies are as follows orchidaceae is possibly the largest family of all angiosperms and hence by far the largest in the order
the dahlgren system recognized three families of orchids but dna sequence analysis later showed that these families are polyphyletic and so should be combined
several studies suggest that orchidaceae is the sister of the rest of the asparagales
other studies have placed the orchids differently in the phylogenetic tree generally among the boryaceae hypoxidaceae clade
the position of orchidaceae shown above seems the best current hypothesis but cannot be taken as confirmed
orchids have simultaneous microsporogenesis and inferior ovaries two characters that are typical of the lower asparagales
however their nectaries are rarely in the septa of the ovaries and most orchids have dust like seeds atypical of the rest of the order
in terms of the number of species orchidaceae diversification is remarkable
however although the other asparagales may be less rich in species they are more variable morphologically including tree like forms
the four families excluding boryaceae form a well supported clade in studies based on dna sequence analysis
all four contain relatively few species and it has been suggested that they be combined into one family under the name hypoxidaceae sensu lato
the relationship between boryaceae and other asparagales has remained unclear for a long time
the boryaceae are mycorrhizal but not in the same way as orchids
morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between boryaceae and blandfordiaceae
there is relatively low support for the position of boryaceae in the tree shown above
the relationship shown between ixioliriaceae and tecophilaeaceae is still unclear
some studies have supported a clade of these two families others have not
the position of doryanthaceae has also varied with support for the position shown above but also support for other positions
the clade from iridaceae upwards appears to have stronger support
all have some genetic characteristics in common having lost arabidopsis type telomeres
iridaceae is distinctive among the asparagales in the unique structure of the inflorescence the combination of an inferior ovary and three stamens and the common occurrence of unifacial leaves whereas bifacial leaves are the norm in other asparagales
members of the clade from iridaceae upwards have infra locular septal nectaries which rudall interpreted as a driver towards secondarily superior ovaries
the next node in the tree has strong support
anomalous secondary thickening occurs among this clade eg in xanthorrhoea and dracaena with species reaching tree like proportions
the core asparagales comprising amaryllidaceae sensu lato and asparagaceae sensu lato are a strongly supported clade as are clades for each of the families
relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear particularly within the asparagaceae sensu lato
stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified
thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above based on apweb is somewhat uncertain
several studies have attempted to date the evolution of the asparagales based on phylogenetic evidence
earlier studies generally give younger dates than more recent studies which have been preferred in the table below
a study suggests that the asparagales have the highest diversification rate in the monocots about the same as the order poales although in both orders the rate is little over half that of the eudicot order lamiales the clade with the highest rate
the taxonomic diversity of the monocotyledons is described in detail by kubitzki
up to date information on the asparagales can be found on the angiosperm phylogeny website
the apg iii systems family circumscriptions are being used as the basis of the kew hosted world checklist of selected plant families
with this circumscription the order consists of families with approximately genera and species
order asparagales link the earlier version apg ii allowed bracketed families ie families which could either be segregated from more comprehensive families or could be included in them
these are the families given under including in the list above
apg iii does not allow bracketed families requiring the use of the more comprehensive family otherwise the circumscription of the asparagales is unchanged
a separate paper accompanying the publication of the apg iii system provided subfamilies to accommodate the families which were discontinued
the first apg system of contained some extra families included in square brackets in the list above
two older systems which use the order asparagales are the dahlgren system and the kubitzki system
the families included in the circumscriptions of the order in these two systems are shown in the first and second columns of the table below
the equivalent family in the modern apg iii system is shown in the third column
note that although these systems may use the same name for a family the genera which it includes may be different so the equivalence between systems is only approximate in some cases
the asparagales include many important crop plants and ornamental plants
crops include allium asparagus and vanilla while ornamentals include irises hyacinths and orchids
the alismatales are an order of flowering plants including about species
plants assigned to this order are mostly tropical or aquatic
some grow in fresh water some in marine habitats
perhaps the most important food crop in the order is the corm of the taro plant colocasia esculenta
the alismatales comprise herbaceous flowering plants of often aquatic and marshy habitats and the only monocots known to have green embryos other than the amaryllidaceae
they also include the only marine angiosperms growing completely submerged the seagrasses
the flowers are usually arranged in inflorescences and the mature seeds lack endosperm
both marine and freshwater forms include those with staminate flowers that detach from the parent plant and float to the surface
there they can pollinate carpellate flowers floating on the surface via long pedicels
in others pollination occurs underwater where pollen may form elongated strands increasing chance of success
most aquatic species have a totally submerged juvenile phase and flowers are either floating or emerge above the waters surface
vegetation may be totally submersed have floating leaves or protrude from the water
collectively they are commonly known as water plantain
the alismatales contain about genera in families with a cosmopolitan distribution
phylogenetically they are basal monocots diverging early in evolution relative to the lilioid and commelinid monocot lineages
together with the acorales the alismatales are referred to informally as the alismatid monocots
cronquists subclass alismatidae conformed fairly closely to the order alismatales as defined by apg minus the araceae
in tahktajans classification the order alismatales contains only the alismataceae and limnocharitaceae making it equivalent to the alismataceae as revised in apg iii
other families included in the alismatates as currently defined are here distributed among additional orders all of which are assigned with the following exception to the subclass alismatidae
araceae in tahktajan is assigned to the arales and placed in the subclass aridae tofieldiaceae to the melanthiales and placed in the liliidae
the angiosperm phylogeny group system of and apg ii assigned the alismatales to the monocots which may be thought of as an unranked clade containing the families listed below
the biggest departure from earlier systems is the inclusion of family araceae
by its inclusion the order has grown enormously in number of species
the family araceae alone accounts for about a hundred genera totaling over two thousand species
the rest of the families together contain only about five hundred species many of which are in very small families
the apg iii system differs only in that the limnocharitaceae are combined with the alismataceae it was also suggested that the genus maundia could be separated into a monogeneric family the maundiaceae but the authors noted that more study was necessary before the maundiaceae could be recognized
in apg iv it was decided that evidence was sufficient to elevate maundia to family level as the monogeneric maundiaceae
the authors considered including a number of the smaller orders within the juncaginaceae but an online survey of botanists and other users found little support for this lumping approach
consequently the family structure for apg iv is the apiales are an order of flowering plants
the families are those recognized in the apg iii system
this is typical of the newer classifications though there is some slight variation and in particular the torriceliaceae may also be divided
under this definition well known members include carrots celery parsley and hedera helix
the order apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the apg iii system
within the asterids apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids and within the campanulids it belongs to a clade known in phylogenetic nomenclature as apiidae
in a subclade of apiidae named dipsapiidae was defined to consist of the three orders apiales paracryphiales and dipsacales
under the cronquist system only the apiaceae and araliaceae were included here and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids
the pittosporaceae were placed within the rosales and many of the other forms within the family cornaceae
pennantia was in the family icacinaceae
in the classification system of dahlgren the families apiaceae and araliaceae were placed in the order ariales in the superorder araliiflorae
the present understanding of the apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of dna sequences by phylogenetic methods
the circumscriptions of some of the families have changed
in one of the subfamilies of araliaceae was shown to be polyphyletic
the largest and obviously closely related families of apiales are araliaceae myodocarpaceae and apiaceae which resemble each other in the structure of their gynoecia
in this respect however the pittosporaceae is notably distinct from them
typical syncarpous gynoecia exhibit four vertical zones determined by the extent of fusion of the carpels
in most plants the synascidiate and symplicate zones are fertile and bear the ovules
each of the first three families possess mainly bi or multilocular ovaries in a gynoecium with a long synascidiate but very short symplicate zone where the ovules are inserted at their transition the so called cross zone
in gynoecia of the pittosporaceae the symplicate is much longer than the synascidiate zone and the ovules are arranged along the first
members of the latter family consequently have unilocular ovaries with a single cavity between adjacent carpels
asterales is an order of dicotyledonous flowering plants that includes the large family asteraceae known for composite flowers made of florets and ten families related to the asteraceae
while asterids in general are characterized by fused petals composite flowers consisting of many florets create the false appearance of separate petals
the order is cosmopolitan and includes mostly herbaceous species although a small number of trees and shrubs are also present
asterales are organisms that seem to have evolved from one common ancestor
asterales share characteristics on morphological and biochemical levels
synapomorphies include the presence in the plants of oligosaccharide inulin a nutrient storage molecule used instead of starch and unique stamen morphology
the stamens are usually found around the style either aggregated densely or fused into a tube probably an adaptation in association with the plunger pollination that is common among the families of the order wherein pollen is collected and stored on the length of the pistil
the name and order asterales is botanically venerable dating back to at least in the hutchinson system of plant taxonomy when it contained only five families of which only two are retained in the apg iii classification
under the cronquist system of taxonomic classification of flowering plants asteraceae was the only family in the group but newer systems have expanded it to
in the classification system of rolf dahlgren the asterales were in the superorder asteriflorae
the order asterales currently includes families the largest of which are the asteraceae with about species and the campanulaceae with about species
the remaining families count together for less than species
the two large families are cosmopolitan with many of their species found in the northern hemisphere and the smaller families are usually confined to australia and the adjacent areas or sometimes south america
only the asteraceae have composite flower heads the other families do not but share other characteristics such as storage of inulin that define the families as more closely related to each other than to other plant families or orders such as the rosids
the phylogenetic tree according to apg iii for the campanulid clade is as below
although most extant species of asteraceae are herbaceous the examination of the basal members in the family suggests that the common ancestor of the family was an arborescent plant a tree or shrub perhaps adapted to dry conditions radiating from south america
less can be said about the asterales themselves with certainty although since several families in asterales contain trees the ancestral member is most likely to have been a tree or shrub
because all clades are represented in the southern hemisphere but many not in the northern hemisphere it is natural to conjecture that there is a common southern origin to them
asterales are angiosperms flowering plants that appeared about million years ago
the asterales order probably originated in the cretaceous on the supercontinent gondwana which broke up from mya forming the area that is now australia south america africa india and antarctica
asterales contain about of eudicot diversity
from an analysis of relationships and diversities within the asterales and with their superorders estimates of the age of the beginning of the asterales have been made which range from mya to mya
however few fossils have been found of the menyanthaceae asteraceae clade in the oligocene about mya
fossil evidence of the asterales is rare and belongs to rather recent epochs so the precise estimation of the orders age is quite difficult
an oligocene pollen is known for asteraceae and goodeniaceae and seeds from oligocene and miocene are known for menyanthaceae and campanulaceae respectively
the core asterales are stylidiaceae apa clade mgca clade and asteraceae
other asterales are rousseaceae campanulaceae and pentaphragmataceae
all asterales families are represented in the southern hemisphere however asteraceae and campanulaceae are cosmopolitan and menyanthaceae nearly so
the asterales by dint of being a super set of the family asteraceae include some species grown for food including the sunflower lettuce and chicory
many are also used as spices and traditional medicines
asterales are common plants and have many known uses
for example pyrethrum is a natural insecticide with minimal environmental impact
wormwood derived from a genus that includes the sagebrush is used as a source of flavoring for absinthe a bitter classical liquor of european origin
an asteroid is a minor planet an object that is neither a true planet nor a comet that orbits within the inner solar system
they are rocky metallic or icy bodies with no atmosphere
sizes and shapes of asteroids vary significantly ranging from meter rocks to a dwarf planet almost km in diameter
of the roughly one million known asteroids the greatest number are located between the orbits of mars and jupiter approximately to au from the sun in the main asteroid belt
asteroids are generally classified to be of three types c type m type and s type
these were named after and are generally identified with carbonaceous metallic and silicaceous compositions respectively
the size of asteroids varies greatly the largest ceres is almost across and qualifies as a dwarf planet
the total mass of all the asteroids combined is only that of earths moon
the majority of main belt asteroids follow slightly elliptical stable orbits revolving in the same direction as the earth and taking from three to six years to complete a full circuit of the sun
asteroids have been historically observed from earth the galileo spacecraft provided the first close observation of an asteroid
several dedicated missions to asteroids were subsequently launched by nasa and jaxa with plans for other missions in progress
nasas near shoemaker studied eros and dawn observed vesta and ceres
jaxas missions hayabusa and hayabusa studied and returned samples of itokawa and ryugu respectively
osiris rex studied bennu collecting a sample in to be delivered back to earth in
nasas lucy launched in will study ten different asteroids two from the main belt and eight jupiter trojans
psyche scheduled for launch in will study a metallic asteroid of the same name
near earth asteroids can threaten all life on the planet an asteroid impact event resulted in the cretaceous paleogene extinction
different asteroid deflection strategies have been proposed the double asteroid redirection test spacecraft or dart was launched in and intentionally impacted dimorphos in september successfully altering its orbit by crashing into it
only one asteroid vesta which has a relatively reflective surface is normally visible to the naked eye
when favorably positioned vesta can be seen in dark skies
rarely small asteroids passing close to earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short amount of time
the minor planet center had data on minor planets in the inner and outer solar system of which about had enough information to be given numbered designations
in german astronomer johann elert bode citing johann daniel titius published a numerical procession known as the titius bode law
except for an unexplained gap between mars and jupiter bodes formula seemed to predict the orbits of the known planets
he wrote the following explanation for the existence of a missing planet this latter point seems in particular to follow from the astonishing relation which the known six planets observe in their distances from the sun
let the distance from the sun to saturn be taken as then mercury is separated by such parts from the sun
venus is
the earth
now comes a gap in this so orderly progression
after mars there follows a space of parts in which no planet has yet been seen
can one believe that the founder of the universe had left this space empty certainly not
from here we come to the distance of jupiter by parts and finally to that of saturn by parts
bodes formula predicted another planet would be found with an orbital radius near astronomical units or million km from the sun
the titius bode law got a boost with william herschels discovery of uranus near the predicted distance for a planet beyond saturn
in a group headed by franz xaver von zach editor of the german astronomical journal monatliche correspondenz sent requests to experienced astronomers asking that they combine their efforts and begin a methodical search for the expected planet
although they did not discover ceres they later found the asteroids pallas juno and vesta
one of the astronomers selected for the search was giuseppe piazzi a catholic priest at the academy of palermo sicily
before receiving his invitation to join the group piazzi discovered ceres on january
he was searching for the th of the catalogue of the zodiacal stars of mr la caille but found that it was preceded by another
instead of a star piazzi had found a moving star like object which he first thought was a comet the light was a little faint and of the colour of jupiter but similar to many others which generally are reckoned of the eighth magnitude
therefore i had no doubt of its being any other than a fixed star
the evening of the third my suspicion was converted into certainty being assured it was not a fixed star
nevertheless before i made it known i waited till the evening of the fourth when i had the satisfaction to see it had moved at the same rate as on the preceding days
piazzi observed ceres a total of times the final time on february when illness interrupted his work
he announced his discovery on january in letters to only two fellow astronomers his compatriot barnaba oriani of milan and bode in berlin
he reported it as a comet but since its movement is so slow and rather uniform it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet
in april piazzi sent his complete observations to oriani bode and french astronomer jrme lalande
the information was published in the september issue of the monatliche correspondenz
by this time the apparent position of ceres had changed and was too close to the suns glare for other astronomers to confirm piazzis observations
toward the end of the year ceres should have been visible again but after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position
to recover ceres mathematician carl friedrich gauss then years old developed an efficient method of orbit determination
in a few weeks he predicted the path of ceres and sent his results to von zach
on december von zach and fellow celestial policeman heinrich w
olbers found ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it
at au from the sun ceres appeared to fit the titius bode law almost perfectly however neptune once discovered in was au closer than predicted leading most astronomers to conclude that the law was a coincidence
piazzi named the newly discovered object ceres ferdinandea in honor of the patron goddess of sicily and of king ferdinand of bourbon
three other asteroids were discovered by von zachs group over the next few years with vesta found in
no new asteroids were discovered until
amateur astronomer karl ludwig hencke started his searches of new asteroids in and fifteen years later while looking for vesta he found the asteroid later named astraea
it was the first new asteroid discovery in years
carl friedrich gauss was given the honor of naming the asteroid
after this other astronomers joined asteroids were found by the end of
in when james craig watson discovered the th asteroid the french academy of sciences engraved the faces of karl theodor robert luther john russell hind and hermann goldschmidt the three most successful asteroid hunters at that time on a commemorative medallion marking the event
in max wolf pioneered the use of astrophotography to detect asteroids which appeared as short streaks on long exposure photographic plates
this dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods wolf alone discovered asteroids beginning with brucia whereas only slightly more than had been discovered up to that point
it was known that there were many more but most astronomers did not bother with them some calling them vermin of the skies a phrase variously attributed to eduard suess and edmund weiss
even a century later only a few thousand asteroids were identified numbered and named
in the past asteroids were discovered by a four step process
first a region of the sky was photographed by a wide field telescope or astrograph
pairs of photographs were taken typically one hour apart
multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days
second the two films or plates of the same region were viewed under a stereoscope
a body in orbit around the sun would move slightly between the pair of films
under the stereoscope the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars
third once a moving body was identified its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope
the location would be measured relative to known star locations
these first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery the observer has only found an apparition which gets a provisional designation made up of the year of discovery a letter representing the half month of discovery and finally a letter and a number indicating the discoverys sequential number
the last step is sending the locations and time of observations to the minor planet center where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit
if so the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the international astronomical union
by the royal astronomical society decided that asteroids were being discovered at such a rapid rate that a different system was needed to categorize or name asteroids
in when de gasparis discovered the twentieth asteroid benjamin valz gave it a name and a number designating its rank among asteroid discoveries massalia
sometimes asteroids were discovered and not seen again
so starting in new asteroids were listed by the year and a capital letter indicating the order in which the asteroids orbit was calculated and registered within that specific year
for example the first two asteroids discovered in were labeled a and b
however there were not enough letters in the alphabet for all of the asteroids discovered in so z was followed by aa
a number of variations of these methods were tried including designations that included year plus a greek letter in
a simple chronological numbering system was established in
currently all newly discovered asteroids receive a provisional designation consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the half month of discovery and the sequence within that half month
once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name
the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number eg eros but dropping the parentheses is quite common
informally it is also common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text
in addition names can be proposed by the asteroids discoverer within guidelines established by the international astronomical union
the first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets
by there were two dozen asteroid symbols which often occurred in multiple variants
in after the fifteenth asteroid eunomia had been discovered johann franz encke made a major change in the upcoming edition of the berliner astronomisches jahrbuch
he introduced a disk a traditional symbol for a star as the generic symbol for an asteroid
the circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid
the numbered circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers and the next asteroid to be discovered was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery
however psyche was given an iconic symbol as well as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years
massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol and no iconic symbols were created after the discovery of fides
the first discovered asteroid ceres was originally considered a new planet
it was followed by the discovery of other similar bodies which with the equipment of the time appeared to be points of light like stars showing little or no planetary disc though readily distinguishable from stars due to their apparent motions
this prompted the astronomer sir william herschel to propose the term asteroid coined in greek as or asteroeids meaning star like star shaped and derived from the ancient greek astr star planet
in the early second half of the th century the terms asteroid and planet were still used interchangeably
traditionally small bodies orbiting the sun were classified as comets asteroids or meteoroids with anything smaller than one meter across being called a meteoroid
the term asteroid never had a formal definition with the broader term small solar system bodies being preferred by the international astronomical union
as no iau definition exists asteroid can be defined as an irregularly shaped rocky body orbiting the sun that does not qualify as a planet or a dwarf planet under the iau definitions of those terms
when found asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets and there was no unified term for the two until small solar system body was coined in
the main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to sublimation of near surface ices by solar radiation
a few objects have ended up being dual listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity
conversely some comets are eventually depleted of their surface volatile ices and become asteroid like
a further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids asteroids with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets
for almost two centuries from the discovery of ceres in until the discovery of the first centaur chiron in all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of jupiter though a few such as hidalgo ventured far beyond jupiter for part of their orbit
when astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than jupiter now called centaurs they numbered them among the traditional asteroids
there was debate over whether these objects should be considered asteroids or given a new classification
then when the first trans neptunian object albion was discovered in and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up new terms were invented to sidestep the issue kuiper belt object trans neptunian object scattered disc object and so on
they inhabit the cold outer reaches of the solar system where ices remain solid and comet like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity if centaurs or trans neptunian objects were to venture close to the sun their volatile ices would sublimate and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids
the innermost of these are the kuiper belt objects called objects partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets
they are thought to be predominantly comet like in composition though some may be more akin to asteroids
furthermore most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional comet nuclei
other recent observations such as the analysis of the cometary dust collected by the stardust probe are increasingly blurring the distinction between comets and asteroids suggesting a continuum between asteroids and comets rather than a sharp dividing line
the minor planets beyond jupiters orbit are sometimes also called asteroids especially in popular presentations
however it is becoming increasingly common for the term asteroid to be restricted to minor planets of the inner solar system
therefore this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids objects of the asteroid belt jupiter trojans and near earth objects
when the iau introduced the class small solar system bodies in to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets they created the class of dwarf planets for the largest minor planets those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity
according to the iau the term minor planet may still be used but generally the term small solar system body will be preferred
currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt ceres at about across has been placed in the dwarf planet category
many asteroids are the shattered remnants of planetesimals bodies within the young suns solar nebula that never grew large enough to become planets
it is thought that planetesimals in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of objects in the solar nebula until jupiter neared its current mass at which point excitation from orbital resonances with jupiter ejected over of planetesimals in the belt
simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately in diameter accreted during that early era whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the jovian disruption
ceres and vesta grew large enough to melt and differentiate with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core leaving rocky minerals in the crust
in the nice model many kuiper belt objects are captured in the outer asteroid belt at distances greater than au
most were later ejected by jupiter but those that remained may be the d type asteroids and possibly include ceres
various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner solar system
their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the solar system and by the yarkovsky effect
significant populations include the majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter generally in relatively low eccentricity orbits
this belt is estimated to contain between and million asteroids larger than in diameter and millions of smaller ones
these asteroids may be remnants of the protoplanetary disk and in this region the accretion of planetesimals into planets during the formative period of the solar system was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by jupiter
contrary to popular imagery the asteroid belt is mostly empty
the asteroids are spread over such a large volume that reaching an asteroid without aiming carefully would be improbable
nonetheless hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known and the total number ranges in the millions or more depending on the lower size cutoff
over asteroids are known to be larger than km and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has between and million asteroids with a diameter of km or more
the absolute magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are between and with the median at about
the total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be kg which is just of the mass of the moon the mass of the kuiper belt and scattered disk is over times as large
the four largest objects ceres vesta pallas and hygiea account for maybe of the belts total mass with accounted for by ceres alone
trojans are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two lagrangian points of stability and which lie ahead of and behind the larger body
in the solar system most known trojans share the orbit of jupiter
they are divided into the greek camp at and the trojan camp at
more than a million jupiter trojans larger than one kilometer are thought to exist of which more than are currently catalogued
in other planetary orbits only nine mars trojans neptune trojans two uranus trojans and two earth trojans have been found to date
a temporary venus trojan is also known
numerical orbital dynamics stability simulations indicate that saturn and uranus probably do not have any primordial trojans
near earth asteroids or neas are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of earth
asteroids that actually cross earths orbital path are known as earth crossers
a total of near earth asteroids were known have a diameter of one kilometer or larger
a small number of neas are extinct comets that have lost their volatile surface materials although having a faint or intermittent comet like tail does not necessarily result in a classification as a near earth comet making the boundaries somewhat fuzzy
the rest of the near earth asteroids are driven out of the asteroid belt by gravitational interactions with jupiter
many asteroids have natural satellites
there were neas known to have at least one moon including three known to have two moons
the asteroid florence one of the largest potentially hazardous asteroids with a diameter of has two moons measuring across which were discovered by radar imaging during the asteroids approach to earth
it is unclear whether martian moons phobos and deimos are captured asteroids or were formed due to impact event on mars
phobos and deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous c type asteroids with spectra albedo and density very similar to those of c or d type asteroids
based on their similarity one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main belt asteroids
both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in marss equatorial plane and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces although it is not clear whether sufficient time was available for this to occur for deimos
capture also requires dissipation of energy
the current martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a phobos sized object by atmospheric braking
geoffrey a
landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces
phobos could be a second generation solar system object that coalesced in orbit after mars formed rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as mars
another hypothesis is that mars was once surrounded by many phobos and deimos sized bodies perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal
the high porosity of the interior of phobos is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin
observations of phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates which are well known from the surface of mars
the spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites again pointing away from an asteroidal origin
both sets of findings support an origin of phobos from material ejected by an impact on mars that reaccreted in martian orbit similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of earths moon
asteroids vary greatly in size from almost for the largest down to rocks just meter across below which an object is classified as a meteoroid
the three largest are very much like miniature planets they are roughly spherical have at least partly differentiated interiors and are thought to be surviving protoplanets
the vast majority however are much smaller and are irregularly shaped they are thought to be either battered planetesimals or fragments of larger bodies
the dwarf planet ceres is by far the largest asteroid with a diameter of
the next largest are vesta and pallas both with diameters of just over
vesta is the brightest of the four main belt asteroids that can on occasion be visible to the naked eye
on some rare occasions a near earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid see apophis
the mass of all the objects of the asteroid belt lying between the orbits of mars and jupiter is estimated to be of the mass of the moon
of this ceres comprises about of the total
adding in the next three most massive objects vesta pallas and hygiea brings this figure up to a bit over whereas the next seven most massive asteroids bring the total up to
the number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease
the number of asteroids decreases markedly with increasing size
although the size distribution generally follows a power law there are bumps at about and where more asteroids than expected from such a curve are found
most asteroids larger than approximately km in diameter are primordial whereas most smaller asteroids are products of fragmentation of primordial asteroids
the primordial population of the main belt was probably times what it is today
three largest objects in the asteroid belt ceres vesta and pallas are intact protoplanets that share many characteristics common to planets and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly shaped asteroids
the fourth largest asteroid hygiea appears nearly spherical although it may have an undifferentiated interior like the majority of asteroids
the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt
ceres is the only asteroid that appears to have a plastic shape under its own gravity and hence the only one that is a dwarf planet
it has a much higher absolute magnitude than the other asteroids of around and may possess a surface layer of ice
like the planets ceres is differentiated it has a crust a mantle and a core
no meteorites from ceres have been found on earth
vesta too has a differentiated interior though it formed inside the solar systems frost line and so is devoid of water its composition is mainly of basaltic rock with minerals such as olivine
aside from the large crater at its southern pole rheasilvia vesta also has an ellipsoidal shape
vesta is the parent body of the vestian family and other v type asteroids and is the source of the hed meteorites which constitute of all meteorites on earth
pallas is unusual in that like uranus it rotates on its side with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane
its composition is similar to that of ceres high in carbon and silicon and perhaps partially differentiated
pallas is the parent body of the palladian family of asteroids
hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid and unlike the other largest asteroids lies relatively close to the plane of the ecliptic
it is the largest member and presumed parent body of the hygiean family of asteroids
because there is no sufficiently large crater on the surface to be the source of that family as there is on vesta it is thought that hygiea may have been completely disrupted in the collision that formed the hygiean family and recoalesced after losing a bit less than of its mass
observations taken with the very large telescopes sphere imager in and revealed that hygiea has a nearly spherical shape which is consistent both with it being in hydrostatic equilibrium or formerly being in hydrostatic equilibrium or with being disrupted and recoalescing
internal differentiation of large asteroids is possibly related to their lack of natural satellites as satellites of main belt asteroids are mostly believed to form from collisional disruption creating a rubble pile structure
measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit
very few asteroids with a diameter larger than meters have a rotation period less than hours
for asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force so any loose surface material would be flung out
however a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly
this suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over meters are rubble piles formed through the accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids
asteroids become darker and redder with age due to space weathering
however evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly in the first hundred thousand years limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids
except for the big four asteroids are likely to be broadly similar in appearance if irregular in shape
mathilde is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroids radius
earth based observations of davida one of the largest asteroids after the big four reveal a similarly angular profile suggesting it is also saturated with radius size craters
medium sized asteroids such as mathilde and ida that have been observed up close also reveal a deep regolith covering the surface
of the big four pallas and hygiea are practically unknown
vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a spheroid
dawn spacecraft revealed that ceres has a heavily cratered surface but with fewer large craters than expected
models based on the formation of the current asteroid belt had suggested ceres should possess to craters larger than in diameter
the largest confirmed crater on ceres kerwan basin is across
the most likely reason for this is viscous relaxation of the crust slowly flattening out larger impacts
asteroids are classified by their characteristic emission spectra with the majority falling into three main groups c type m type and s type
these were named after and are generally identified with carbonaceous metallic and silicaceous compositions respectively
the physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood
ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle where vesta is thought to have a nickel iron core olivine mantle and basaltic crust
thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid hygiea seems to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite but it may actually be a differentiated asteroid that was globally disrupted by an impact and then reassembled
other asteroids appear to be the remnant cores or mantles of proto planets high in rock and metal
most small asteroids are believed to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity although the largest are probably solid
some asteroids have moons or are co orbiting binaries rubble piles moons binaries and scattered asteroid families are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid or possibly a planet
in the main asteroid belt there appear to be two primary populations of asteroid a dark volatile rich population consisting of the c type and p type asteroids with albedos less than and densities under and a dense volatile poor population consisting of the s type and m type asteroids with albedos over and densities greater than within these populations larger asteroids are denser presumably due to compression
there appears to be minimal macro porosity in the score of asteroids with masses greater than
composition is calculated from three primary sources albedo surface spectrum and density
the last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have
so far every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume
the investigated asteroids are as large as km in diameter and include hermione and sylvia
few asteroids are larger than sylvia none of them have moons
the fact that such large asteroids as sylvia may be rubble piles presumably due to disruptive impacts has important consequences for the formation of the solar system computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge
this means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly
scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to earth was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the moon
in the presence of water ice was confirmed on the surface of themis using nasas infrared telescope facility
the surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice
as this ice layer is sublimating it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface
organic compounds were also detected on the surface
the presence of ice on themis makes the initial theory plausible
in october water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time on an asteroid orbiting the white dwarf gd
on january european space agency scientists reported the detection for the first definitive time of water vapor on ceres the largest object in the asteroid belt
the detection was made by using the far infrared abilities of the herschel space observatory
the finding is unexpected because comets not asteroids are typically considered to sprout jets and plumes
according to one of the scientists the lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids
findings have shown that solar winds can react with the oxygen in the upper layer of the asteroids and create water
it has been estimated that every cubic metre of irradiated rock could contain up to litres study was conducted using an atom probe tomography numbers are given for the itokawa s type asteroid
acfer a meteorite discovered in algeria in was shown in to have an ultraporous lithology porous texture that could be formed by removal of ice that filled these pores this suggests that upl represent fossils of primordial ice
asteroids contain traces of amino acids and other organic compounds and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life or may have even brought life itself to earth
in august a report based on nasa studies with meteorites found on earth was published suggesting dna and rna components may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space
in november scientists reported detecting for the first time sugar molecules including ribose in meteorites suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio ingredients important to life and supporting the notion of an rna world prior to a dna based origin of life on earth and possibly as well the notion of panspermia
asteroids are commonly categorized according to two criteria the characteristics of their orbits and features of their reflectance spectrum
many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics
apart from the broadest divisions it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered
groups are relatively loose dynamical associations whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past
families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt but several small families have been reported among the jupiter trojans
main belt families were first recognized by kiyotsugu hirayama in and are often called hirayama families in his honor
about of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids
a family has also been associated with the plutoid dwarf planet
some asteroids have unusual horseshoe orbits that are co orbital with earth or another planet
examples are cruithne and
the first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between saturns moons epimetheus and janus
sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become quasi satellites for a few decades or a few hundred years before returning to their earlier status
both earth and venus are known to have quasi satellites
such objects if associated with earth or venus or even hypothetically mercury are a special class of aten asteroids
however such objects could be associated with the outer planets as well
in an asteroid taxonomic system based on color albedo and spectral shape was developed by chapman morrison and zellner
these properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroids surface material
the original classification system had three categories c types for dark carbonaceous objects s types for stony objects and u for those that did not fit into either c or s
this classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types
the number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied
the two most widely used taxonomies now used are the tholen classification and smass classification
the former was proposed in by david j
tholen and was based on data collected from an eight color asteroid survey performed in the s
this resulted in asteroid categories
in the small main belt asteroid spectroscopic survey resulted in a modified version of the tholen taxonomy with different types
both systems have three broad categories of c s and x asteroids where x consists of mostly metallic asteroids such as the m type
there are also several smaller classes
the proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type some types are easier to detect than others biasing the totals
originally spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroids composition
however the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good and a variety of classifications are in use
this has led to significant confusion
although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of the same materials
active asteroids are objects that have asteroid like orbits but show comet like visual characteristics
that is they show comae tails or other visual evidence of mass loss but their orbit remains within jupiters orbit
these bodies were originally designated main belt comets in by astronomers david jewitt and henry hsieh but this name implies they are necessarily icy in composition like a comet and that they only exist within the main belt whereas the growing population of active asteroids shows that this is not always the case
the first active asteroid discovered is elst pizarro
it was discovered in but then was found to have a tail by eric elst and guido pizarro in and given the cometary designation p elst pizarro
another notable object is p panstarrs observations made by the hubble space telescope revealed that it had six comet like tails
the tails are suspected to be streams of material ejected by the asteroid as a result of a rubble pile asteroid spinning fast enough to remove material from it
by smashing into the asteroid dimorphos nasas double asteroid redirection test spacecraft made it an active asteroid
scientists had proposed that some active asteroids are the result of impact events but no one had ever observed the activation of an asteroid
the dart mission activated dimorphos under precisely known and carefully observed impact conditions enabling the detailed study of the formation of an active asteroid for the first time
observations show that dimorphos lost approximately million kilograms after the collision
impact produced a dust plume that temporarily brightened the didymos system and developed a long dust tail that persisted for several months
until the age of space travel objects in the asteroid belt could only be observed with large telescopes their shapes and terrain remaining a mystery
the best modern ground based telescopes and the earth orbiting hubble space telescope can only resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids
limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their light curves and their spectral properties
sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occultations
radar imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters especially for near earth asteroids
spacecraft flybys can provide much more data than any ground or space based observations sample return missions gives insights about regolith composition
as asteroids are rather small and faint objects the data that can be obtained from ground based observations are limited
by means of ground based optical telescopes the visual magnitude can be obtained when converted into the absolute magnitude it gives a rough estimate of the asteroids size
light curve measurements can also be made by gbo when collected over a long period of time it allows an estimate of the rotational period the pole orientation and a rough estimate of the asteroids shape
spectral data gives information about the objects composition used to classify the observed asteroids
such observations are limited as they provide information about only the thin layer on the surface
as planetologist patrick michel writes mid to thermal infrared observations along with polarimetry measurements are probably the only data that give some indication of actual physical properties
measuring the heat flux of an asteroid at a single wavelength gives an estimate of the dimensions of the object these measurements have lower uncertainty than measurements of the reflected sunlight in the visible light spectral region
if the two measurements can be combined both the effective diameter and the geometric albedo the latter being a measure of the brightness at zero phase angle that is when illumination comes from directly behind the observer can be derived
in addition thermal measurements at two or more wavelengths plus the brightness in the visible light region give information on the thermal properties
the thermal inertia which is a measure of how fast a material heats up or cools off of most observed asteroids is lower than the bare rock reference value but greater than that of the lunar regolith this observation indicates the presence of an insulating layer of granular material on their surface
moreover there seems to be a trend perhaps related to the gravitational environment that smaller objects have a small regolith layer consisting of coarse grains while larger objects have a thicker regolith layer consisting of fine grains
however the detailed properties of this regolith layer are poorly known from remote observations
moreover the relation between thermal inertia and surface roughness is not straightforward so one needs to interpret the thermal inertia with caution
near earth asteroids that come into close vicinity of the planet can be studied in more details with radar it provides information about the surface of the asteroid
such observations were conducted by the arecibo observatory in puerto rico and goldstone observatory in california
radar observations can also be used for accurate determination of the orbital and rotational dynamics of observed objects
both space and ground based observatories conducted asteroid search programs the space based searches are expected to detect more objects because there is no atmosphere to interfere and because they can observe larger portions of the sky
neowise observed more than asteroids of the main belt spitzer space telescope observed more than near earth asteroids
these observations determined rough sizes of the majority of observed objects but provided limited detail about surface properties
asteroids were also studied by the hubble space telescope such as tracking the colliding asteroids in the main belt break up of an asteroid observing an active asteroid with six comet like tails and observing asteroids that were chosen as targets of dedicated missions
according to patrick michel the internal structure of asteroids is inferred only from indirect evidence bulk densities measured by spacecraft the orbits of natural satellites in the case of asteroid binaries and the drift of an asteroids orbit due to the yarkovsky thermal effect
a spacecraft near an asteroid is perturbed enough by the asteroids gravity to allow an estimate of the asteroids mass
the volume is then estimated using a model of the asteroids shape
mass and volume allow the derivation of the bulk density whose uncertainty is usually dominated by the errors made on the volume estimate
the internal porosity of asteroids can be inferred by comparing their bulk density with that of their assumed meteorite analogues dark asteroids seem to be more porous than bright ones
the nature of this porosity is unclear
the first asteroid to be photographed in close up was gaspra in followed in by ida and its moon dactyl all of which were imaged by the galileo probe en route to jupiter
other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include braille annefrank teins and lutetia and toutatis
the first dedicated asteroid probe was nasas near shoemaker which photographed mathilde in before entering into orbit around eros finally landing on its surface in
it was the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid
from september to november the japanese hayabusa probe studied itokawa in detail and returned samples of its surface to earth on june the first asteroid sample return mission
in nasa launched the dawn spacecraft which orbited vesta for a year and observed the dwarf planet ceres for three years
hayabusa a probe launched by jaxa orbited its target asteroid ryugu for more than a year and took samples that were delivered to earth in
the spacecraft is now on an extended mission and expected to arrive at a new target in
nasa launched the osiris rex in a sample return mission to asteroid bennu
in the probe departed the asteroid with a sample from its surface
sample delivery to earth is expected on september
the spacecraft will continue on an extended mission designated osiris apex to explore near earth asteroid apophis in
in nasa launched double asteroid redirection test a mission to test technology for defending earth against potential hazardous objects
dart deliberately crashed into the minor planet moon dimorphos of the double asteroid didymos in september to assess the potential of a spacecraft impact to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with earth
in october nasa declared dart a success confirming it had shortened dimorphos orbital period around didymos by about minutes
currently several asteroid dedicated missions are planned by nasa jaxa esa and cnsa
nasas lucy launched in would visit eight asteroids one from the main belt and seven jupiter trojans it is the first mission to trojans
the main mission would start in
esas hera planned for launch in will study the results of the dart impact
it will measure the size and morphology of the crater and momentum transmitted by the impact to determine the efficiency of the deflection produced by dart
nasas psyche would be launched in or to study the large metallic asteroid of the same name
jaxas destiny is a mission for a flyby of the geminids meteor shower parent body phaethon as well as various minor bodies
its launch is planned for
cnsas tianwen is planned to launch in
it will use solar electric propulsion to explore the co orbital near earth asteroid kamooalewa and the active asteroid p panstarrs
the spacecraft will collect samples of the regolith of kamooalewa
the concept of asteroid mining was proposed in s
matt anderson defines successful asteroid mining as the development of a mining program that is both financially self sustaining and profitable to its investors
it has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on earth or materials for constructing space habitats
materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for space manufacturing and construction
as resource depletion on earth becomes more real the idea of extracting valuable elements from asteroids and returning these to earth for profit or using space based resources to build solar power satellites and space habitats becomes more attractive
hypothetically water processed from ice could refuel orbiting propellant depots
from the astrobiological perspective asteroid prospecting could provide scientific data for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence
some astrophysicists have suggested that if advanced extraterrestrial civilizations employed asteroid mining long ago the hallmarks of these activities might be detectable
mining ceres is also considered a possibility
as the largest body in the asteroid belt ceres could become the main base and transport hub for future asteroid mining infrastructure allowing mineral resources to be transported to mars the moon and earth
because of its small escape velocity combined with large amounts of water ice it also could serve as a source of water fuel and oxygen for ships going through and beyond the asteroid belt
transportation from mars or the moon to ceres would be even more energy efficient than transportation from earth to the moon
there is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross earths and that could given enough time collide with earth
the three most important groups of near earth asteroids are the apollos amors and atens
the near earth asteroid eros had been discovered as long ago as and the s brought a flurry of similar objects
in order of discovery these were amor apollo adonis and finally hermes which approached within au of earth in
astronomers began to realize the possibilities of earth impact
two events in later decades increased the alarm the increasing acceptance of the alvarez hypothesis that an impact event resulted in the cretaceous paleogene extinction and the observation of comet shoemaker levy crashing into jupiter
the us military also declassified the information that its military satellites built to detect nuclear explosions had detected hundreds of upper atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across
all of these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys consisting of charge coupled device cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes
it was estimated that to of near earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered
a list of teams using such systems includes the linear system alone had discovered asteroids
among the surveys near earth asteroids have been discovered including almost more than in diameter
in april the b foundation reported it is percent certain well be hit a devastating asteroid but were not percent sure when
in june the national science and technology council warned that the united states is unprepared for an asteroid impact event and has developed and released the national near earth object preparedness strategy action plan to better prepare
according to expert testimony in the united states congress in nasa would require at least five years of preparation before a mission to intercept an asteroid could be launched
the united nations declared june as international asteroid day to educate the public about asteroids
the date of international asteroid day commemorates the anniversary of the tunguska asteroid impact over siberia on june
the chicxulub crater is an impact crater buried underneath the yucatn peninsula in mexico
its center is offshore near the communities of chicxulub puerto and chicxulub pueblo after which the crater is named
it was formed when a large asteroid about in diameter struck the earth
the crater is estimated to be in diameter and in depth
it is one of the largest confirmed impact structures on earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research
in the late s geologist walter alvarez and his father nobel prize winning scientist luis walter alvarez put forth their theory that the cretaceous paleogene extinction was caused by an impact event
the main evidence of such an impact was contained in a thin layer of clay present in the k pg boundary in gubbio italy
the alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of iridium a chemical element rare on earth but common in asteroids
iridium levels in this layer were as much as times above the background level
it was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the earths surface among other material thrown up by the impact producing the layer of iridium enriched clay
at the time consensus was not settled on what caused the cretaceous paleogene extinction and the boundary layer with theories including a nearby supernova climate change or a geomagnetic reversal
the alvarezes impact hypothesis was rejected by many paleontologists who believed that the lack of fossils found close to the k pg boundary the three meter problem suggested a more gradual die off of fossil species
there is broad consensus that the chicxulub impactor was an asteroid with a carbonaceous chondrite composition rather than a comet
the impactor was around in diameter large enough that if set at sea level it would have reached taller than mount everest
various collision avoidance techniques have different trade offs with respect to metrics such as overall performance cost failure risks operations and technology readiness
there are various methods for changing the course of an asteroid comet
these can be differentiated by various types of attributes such as the type of mitigation energy source and approach strategy
strategies fall into two basic sets fragmentation and delay
fragmentation concentrates on rendering the impactor harmless by fragmenting it and scattering the fragments so that they miss the earth or are small enough to burn up in the atmosphere
delay exploits the fact that both the earth and the impactor are in orbit
an impact occurs when both reach the same point in space at the same time or more correctly when some point on earths surface intersects the impactors orbit when the impactor arrives
since the earth is approximately km in diameter and moves at approx
km per second in its orbit it travels a distance of one planetary diameter in about seconds or slightly over seven minutes
delaying or advancing the impactors arrival by times of this magnitude can depending on the exact geometry of the impact cause it to miss the earth
project icarus was one of the first projects designed in as a contingency plan in case of collision with icarus
the plan relied on the new saturn v rocket which did not make its first flight until after the report had been completed
six saturn v rockets would be used each launched at variable intervals from months to hours away from impact
each rocket was to be fitted with a single megaton nuclear warhead as well as a modified apollo service module and uncrewed apollo command module for guidance to the target
the warheads would be detonated meters from the surface deflecting or partially destroying the asteroid
depending on the subsequent impacts on the course or the destruction of the asteroid later missions would be modified or cancelled as needed
the last ditch launch of the sixth rocket would be hours prior to impact
asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories
asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction as places human beings might colonize resources for extracting minerals hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points and as a threat to life on earth or other inhabited planets dwarf planets and natural satellites by potential impact
an allocution or allocutus is a formal statement made to the court by the defendant who has been found guilty prior to being sentenced
it is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using common law
an allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient
in plea bargains an allocution may be required of the defendant
the defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence
in principle that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendants guilt in the matter
the term allocution is used generally only in jurisdictions in the united states but there are vaguely similar processes in other common law countries
in many other jurisdictions it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on their clients behalf and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak
the right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution
in australia the term allocutus is used by the clerk of arraigns or another formal associate of the court
it is generally phrased as prisoner at the bar you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of xyz
do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this court should not now be passed upon you the defense counsel will then make a plea in mitigation in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendants previous good character and good works if any
the right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute
if a judge or magistrate refuses to hear such a plea or does not properly consider it the sentence can be overturned on appeal
in most of the united states defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed
some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right
in its absence a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing
in the federal system federal rules of criminal procedure provides that the court must address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence
the federal public defender recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in
an is a written statement voluntarily made by an affiant or deponent under an oath or affirmation which is administered by a person who is authorized to do so by law
such a statement is witnessed as to the authenticity of the affiants signature by a taker of oaths such as a notary public or commissioner of oaths
an affidavit is a type of verified statement or showing or in other words it contains a verification which means that it is made under oath on penalty of perjury and this serves as evidence for its veracity and is required in court proceedings
an affidavit is typically defined as a written declaration or statement that is sworn or affirmed before a person who has authority to administer an oath
there is no general defined form for an affidavit although for some proceedings an affidavit must satisfy legal or statutory requirements in order to be considered
an affidavit may include in some cases an introductory clause called a preamble is added attesting that the affiant personally appeared before the authenticating authority
an affidavit may also recite that the statement it records was made under penalty of perjury
an affidavit that is prepared for use within the context of litigation may also include a caption that identifies the venue and parties to the relevant judicial proceedings
on march the high court of australia held that the act uniform evidence legislation is neutral in the way sworn evidence and unsworn evidence is treated as being of equal weight
the term affidavit is used in the uk
according the uk government website the affidavit can be sworn or affirmed by a solicitor notary or commissioner for oaths or by an authorised member of court staff
in indian law although an affidavit may be taken as proof of the facts stated therein the courts have no jurisdiction to admit evidence by way of affidavit
affidavit is not treated as evidence within the meaning of section of the evidence act
however it was held by the supreme court that an affidavit can be used as evidence only if the court so orders for sufficient reasons namely the right of the opposite party to have the deponent produced for cross examination
therefore an affidavit cannot ordinarily be used as evidence in absence of a specific order of the court
in sri lanka under the oaths ordinance with the exception of a court martial a person may submit an affidavit signed in the presence of a commissioner for oaths or a justice of the peace
affidavits are made in a similar way as to england and wales although make oath is sometimes omitted
an affirmed affidavit may be substituted for an sworn affidavit in most cases for those opposed to swearing oaths
the person making the affidavit is known as the deponent and signs the affidavit
the affidavit concludes in the standard format sworn affirmed before me of commissioner for oaths solicitor a commissioner for oaths on the at and i know the deponent and it is signed and stamped by the commissioner for oaths
it is important that the commissioner states his her name clearly sometimes documents are rejected when the name cannot be ascertained
in august a new method of filing affidavits came into force
under section of the civil law and criminal law act witnesses are no longer required to swear before god or make an affirmation when filing an affidavit
instead witnesses will make a non religious statement of truth and if it is breached will be liable for up to one year in prison if convicted summarily or upon conviction on indictment to a maximum fine of or imprisonment for a term not exceeding years or both
this is designed to replace affidavits and statutory declarations in situations where the electronic means of lodgement or filing of documents with the court provided for in section is utilised
as of january it has yet to be adopted widely and it is expected it will not be used for some time by lay litigants who will still lodge papers in person
in american jurisprudence under the rules for hearsay admission of an unsupported affidavit as evidence is unusual with regard to material facts which may be dispositive of the matter at bar
affidavits from persons who are dead or otherwise incapacitated or who cannot be located or made to appear may be accepted by the court but usually only in the presence of corroborating evidence
an affidavit which reflected a better grasp of the facts close in time to the actual events may be used to refresh a witnesss recollection
materials used to refresh recollection are admissible as evidence
if the affiant is a party in the case the affiants opponent may be successful in having the affidavit admitted as evidence as statements by a party opponent are admissible through an exception to the hearsay rule
affidavits are typically included in the response to interrogatories
requests for admissions under federal rule of civil procedure however are not required to be sworn
when a person signs an affidavit that person is eligible to take the stand at a trial or evidentiary hearing
one party may wish to summon the affiant to verify the contents of the affidavit while the other party may want to cross examine the affiant about the affidavit
some types of motions will not be accepted by the court unless accompanied by an independent sworn statement or other evidence in support of the need for the motion
in such a case a court will accept an affidavit from the filing attorney in support of the motion as certain assumptions are made to wit the affidavit in place of sworn testimony promotes judicial economy
the lawyer is an officer of the court and knows that a false swearing by them if found out could be grounds for severe penalty up to and including disbarment
the lawyer if called upon would be able to present independent and more detailed evidence to prove the facts set forth in his affidavit
affidavits should not be confused with unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury
in federal courts and about states as of unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury are authorized by statute as acceptable in lieu of affidavits
the key differences are that an unsworn declaration does not bear the jurat of a notary public and the declarant is not required to swear an oath or affirmation
rather the signature of the declarant under a carefully worded phrase binding them to the truth of their statements under penalty of perjury is deemed as a matter of law to be sufficiently solemn to remind the declarant of their duty to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
the point of such affidavit substitution statutes is that unsworn declarations can be prepared and executed far more quickly and economically than affidavits in that the witness need not meet personally with a notary public for the notarization process
the acceptance of an affidavit by one society does not confirm its acceptance as a legal document in other jurisdictions
equally the acceptance that a lawyer is an officer of the court is not a given
this matter is addressed by the use of the apostille a means of certifying the legalization of a document for international use under the terms of the hague convention abolishing the requirement of legalization for foreign public documents
documents which have been notarized by a notary public and certain other documents and then certified with a conformant apostille are accepted for legal use in all the nations that have signed the hague convention
thus most affidavits now require to be apostilled if used for cross border issues
aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac
it is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between pisces to the west and taurus to the east
the name aries is latin for ram
its old astronomical symbol is
it is one of the constellations described by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and remains one of the modern constellations
it is a mid sized constellation ranking th in overall size with an area of square degrees
aries has represented a ram since late babylonian times
before that the stars of aries formed a farmhand
different cultures have incorporated the stars of aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in china and a porpoise in the marshall islands
aries is a relatively dim constellation possessing only four bright stars hamal sheratan mesarthim and arietis
the few deep sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies
several meteor showers appear to radiate from aries including the daytime arietids and the epsilon arietids
aries is now recognized as an official constellation albeit as a specific region of the sky by the international astronomical union
it was originally defined in ancient texts as a specific pattern of stars and has remained a constellation since ancient times it now includes the ancient pattern and the surrounding stars
in the description of the babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the mulapin the constellation now known as aries was the final station along the ecliptic
the mulapin was a comprehensive table of the rising and settings of stars which likely served as an agricultural calendar
modern day aries was known as the agrarian worker or the hired man
although likely compiled in the th or th century bc the mulapin reflects a tradition that marks the pleiades as the vernal equinox which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the middle bronze age
the earliest identifiable reference to aries as a distinct constellation comes from the boundary stones that date from to bc
on several boundary stones a zodiacal ram figure is distinct from the other characters
the shift in identification from the constellation as the agrarian worker to the ram likely occurred in later babylonian tradition because of its growing association with dumuzi the shepherd
by the time the mulapin was created in bc modern aries was identified with both dumuzis ram and a hired labourer
the exact timing of this shift is difficult to determine due to the lack of images of aries or other ram figures
in ancient egyptian astronomy aries was associated with the god amon ra who was depicted as a man with a rams head and represented fertility and creativity
because it was the location of the vernal equinox it was called the indicator of the reborn sun
during the times of the year when aries was prominent priests would process statues of amon ra to temples a practice that was modified by persian astronomers centuries later
aries acquired the title of lord of the head in egypt referring to its symbolic and mythological importance
aries was not fully accepted as a constellation until classical times
in hellenistic astrology the constellation of aries is associated with the golden ram of greek mythology that rescued phrixus and helle on orders from hermes taking phrixus to the land of colchis
phrixus and helle were the son and daughter of king athamas and his first wife nephele
the kings second wife ino was jealous and wished to kill his children
to accomplish this she induced famine in boeotia then falsified a message from the oracle of delphi that said phrixus must be sacrificed to end the famine
athamas was about to sacrifice his son atop mount laphystium when aries sent by nephele arrived
helle fell off of ariess back in flight and drowned in the dardanelles also called the hellespont in her honour
historically aries has been depicted as a crouched wingless ram with its head turned towards taurus
ptolemy asserted in his almagest that hipparchus depicted alpha arietis as the rams muzzle though ptolemy did not include it in his constellation figure
instead it was listed as an unformed star and denoted as the star over the head
john flamsteed in his atlas coelestis followed ptolemys description by mapping it above the figures head
flamsteed followed the general convention of maps by depicting aries lying down
astrologically aries has been associated with the head and its humors
it was strongly associated with mars both the planet and the god
it was considered to govern western europe and syria and to indicate a strong temper in a person
the first point of aries the location of the vernal equinox is named for the constellation
this is because the sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in aries more than two millennia ago
hipparchus defined it in bc
as a point south of gamma arietis
because of the precession of the equinoxes the first point of aries has since moved into pisces and will move into aquarius by around ad
the sun now appears in aries from late april through mid may though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring
medieval muslim astronomers depicted aries in various ways
astronomers like al sufi saw the constellation as a ram modelled on the precedent of ptolemy
however some islamic celestial globes depicted aries as a nondescript four legged animal with what may be antlers instead of horns
some early bedouin observers saw a ram elsewhere in the sky this constellation featured the pleiades as the rams tail
the generally accepted arabic formation of aries consisted of thirteen stars in a figure along with five unformed stars four of which were over the animals hindquarters and one of which was the disputed star over ariess head
al sufis depiction differed from both other arab astronomers and flamsteeds in that his aries was running and looking behind itself
the obsolete constellations of aries all centred on the same the northern stars
in petrus plancius introduced apes a constellation representing a bee
in the same stars were used by jakob bartsch as for vespa representing a wasp
in augustin royer used these stars for his constellation lilium representing the fleur de lis
none of these constellations became widely accepted
johann hevelius renamed the constellation musca in in his firmamentum sobiescianum
to differentiate it from musca the southern fly it was later renamed musca borealis but it did not gain acceptance and its stars were ultimately officially reabsorbed into aries
the asterism involved was and arietis
in the international astronomical union defined its recommended three letter abbreviation ari
the official boundaries of aries were defined in by eugne delporte as a polygon of segments
its right ascension is between h m and h m and its declination is between and in the equatorial coordinate system
in traditional chinese astronomy stars from aries were used in several constellations
the brightest stars alpha beta and gamma arietis formed a constellation called lou variously translated as bond lasso and sickle which was associated with the ritual sacrifice of cattle
this name was shared by the th lunar mansion the location of the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox
this constellation has also been associated with harvest time as it could represent a woman carrying a basket of food on her head
and arietis were part of a constellation called wei which represented a fat abdomen and was the namesake of the th lunar mansion which represented granaries
delta and zeta arietis were a part of the constellation tianyin thought to represent the emperors hunting partner
zuogeng a constellation depicting a marsh and pond inspector was composed of mu nu omicron pi and sigma arietis
he was accompanied by yeou kang a constellation depicting an official in charge of pasture distribution
in a similar system to the chinese the first lunar mansion in hindu astronomy was called aswini after the traditional names for beta and gamma arietis the aswins
because the hindu new year began with the vernal equinox the rig veda contains over new years related hymns to the twins making them some of the most prominent characters in the work
aries itself was known as aja and mesha
in hebrew astronomy aries was named taleh it signified either simeon or gad and generally symbolizes the lamb of the world
the neighboring syrians named the constellation amru and the bordering turks named it kuzi
half a world away in the marshall islands several stars from aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a porpoise along with stars from cassiopeia andromeda and triangulum
alpha beta and gamma arietis formed the head of the porpoise while stars from andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of cassiopeia formed the tail
other polynesian peoples recognized aries as a constellation
the marquesas islanders called it na pai ka the mori constellation pipiri may correspond to modern aries as well
in indigenous peruvian astronomy a constellation with most of the same stars as aries existed
it was called the market moon and the kneeling terrace as a reminder of when to hold the annual harvest festival ayri huay
aries has three prominent stars forming an asterism designated alpha beta and gamma arietis by johann bayer
alpha and beta are commonly used for navigation
there is also one other star above the fourth magnitude arietis
arietis called hamal is the brightest star in aries
its traditional name is derived from the arabic word for lamb or head of the ram which references ariess mythological background
with a spectral class of k and a luminosity class of iii it is an orange giant with an apparent visual magnitude of which lies light years from earth
hamal has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is arietis also known as sheratan is a blue white star with an apparent visual magnitude of
its traditional name is derived from sharatayn the arabic word for the two signs referring to both beta and gamma arietis in their position as heralds of the vernal equinox
the two stars were known to the bedouin as qarna al hamal horns of the ram
it is light years from earth
it has a luminosity of and its absolute magnitude is it is a spectroscopic binary star one in which the companion star is only known through analysis of the spectra
the spectral class of the primary is a
hermann carl vogel determined that sheratan was a spectroscopic binary in its orbit was determined by hans ludendorff in
it has since been studied for its eccentric orbit
arietis with a common name of mesarthim is a binary star with two white hued components located in a rich field of magnitude stars
its traditional name has conflicting derivations
it may be derived from a corruption of al sharatan the arabic word meaning pair or a word for fat ram
however it may also come from the sanskrit for first star of aries or the hebrew for ministerial servants both of which are unusual languages of origin for star names
along with beta arietis it was known to the bedouin as qarna al hamal
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude
the system is light years from earth
the two components are separated by arcseconds and the system as a whole has an apparent magnitude of the primary has a luminosity of and the secondary has a luminosity of the primary is an a type star with an absolute magnitude of and the secondary is a b type star with an absolute magnitude of the angle between the two components is
mesarthim was discovered to be a double star by robert hooke in one of the earliest such telescopic discoveries
the primary arietis is an alpha canum venaticorum variable star that has a range of magnitudes and a period of days
it is unusual because of its strong silicon emission lines
the constellation is home to several double stars including epsilon lambda and pi arietis
arietis is a binary star with two white components
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the system is light years from earth
its overall magnitude is and the primary has an absolute magnitude of its spectral class is a
the two components are separated by arcseconds
arietis is a wide double star with a white hued primary and a yellow hued secondary
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the primary is light years from earth
it has an absolute magnitude of and a spectral class of f
the two components are separated by arcseconds at an angle of the two stars are located east of arietis
arietis is a close binary star with a blue white primary and a white secondary
the primary is of magnitude and the secondary is of magnitude the primary is light years from earth
the primary itself is a wide double star with a separation of arcseconds the tertiary has a magnitude of the primary and secondary are separated by arcseconds
most of the other stars in aries visible to the naked eye have magnitudes between and
ari called boten is a star of magnitude light years away
it has an absolute magnitude of and a spectral class of k
arietis is a star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is a and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is f and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a similar star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is k and its absolute magnitude is arietis is a dim star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b and its absolute magnitude is arietis known both as c arietis and nair al butain is a brighter star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b and it has a luminosity of
its absolute magnitude is arietis is a runaway star of magnitude light years away
its spectral class is b
it was likely ejected from the orion nebula approximately five million years ago possibly due to supernovae
finally teegardens star is the closest star to earth in aries
it is a red dwarf of magnitude and spectral class mv
with a proper motion of arcseconds per year it is the th closest star to earth overall
aries has its share of variable stars including r and u arietis mira type variable stars and t arietis a semi regular variable star
r arietis is a mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
it is light years away
u arietis is another mira variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
t arietis is a semiregular variable star that ranges in magnitude from a minimum of to a maximum of with a period of days
it is light years away
one particularly interesting variable in aries is sx arietis a rotating variable star considered to be the prototype of its class helium variable stars
sx arietis stars have very prominent emission lines of helium i and silicon iii
they are normally main sequence bp bp stars and their variations are not usually visible to the naked eye
therefore they are observed photometrically usually having periods that fit in the course of one night
similar to alpha canum venaticorum variables sx arietis stars have periodic changes in their light and magnetic field which correspond to the periodic rotation they differ from the alpha canum venaticorum variables in their higher temperature
there are between and sx arietis variable stars currently known ten are noted as being uncertain in the general catalog of variable stars
ngc is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of located southeast of arietis and arcminutes west of arietis
it is a relatively bright galaxy and shows obvious nebulosity and ellipticity in an amateur telescope
it is by arcminutes meaning that its surface brightness magnitude is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude
ngc is a class sab galaxy which means that it is an unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly
the main arm on the northwest side of the galaxy is home to many star forming regions this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies
ngc has a small companion galaxy ngc that is about light years away from the larger galaxy
the two galaxies together are also classified as arp in the arp peculiar galaxy catalog
ngc has a diameter of light years and the system is million light years from earth
another spiral galaxy in aries is ngc a face on class sabc galaxy
it is a weakly barred spiral galaxy with loosely wound arms
it has no ring and a faint bulge and is by arcminutes
it has two primary arms with fragments located farther from the core
light years in diameter ngc is million light years from earth
ngc and ngc are a pair of galaxies in aries that are only about light years apart
part of the ngc group of galaxies both are at a distance of approximately million light years
ngc is an edge on spiral galaxy that is by arcminutes
ngc an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary is the brighter of the two at magnitude ngc has a magnitude of
both galaxies have bright cores but ngc is the larger galaxy at a diameter of light years ngc has a diameter of light years
ngc is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane
ngc itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight
it has multiple spiral arms and a bright core
because it is so diffuse it has a low surface brightness
it has a diameter of light years and is million light years away
ngc is the brightest member of an galaxy group that also includes ngc ngc and ngc with a magnitude of
it is by arcminutes and is million light years away with a diameter of light years
its companion is ngc which is about light years from the core of ngc
they are interacting gravitationally as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust
arp is a different pair of interacting galaxies in aries consisting of ngc and ic
ngc is an e elliptical galaxy
it is unusual because it has hints of an early spiral structure which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies
ngc is by arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of its diameter is light years and it is million light years away
another unusual galaxy in aries is segue a dwarf and satellite galaxy of the milky way recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization
aries is home to several meteor showers
the daytime arietid meteor shower is one of the strongest meteor showers that occurs during the day lasting from may to july
it is an annual shower associated with the marsden group of comets that peaks on june with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of meteors
its parent body may be the asteroid icarus
the meteors are sometimes visible before dawn because the radiant is degrees away from the sun
they usually appear at a rate of per hour as earthgrazers meteors that last several seconds and often begin at the horizon
because most of the daytime arietids are not visible to the naked eye they are observed in the radio spectrum
this is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake
other meteor showers radiate from aries during the day these include the daytime epsilon arietids and the northern and southern daytime may arietids
the jodrell bank observatory discovered the daytime arietids in when james hey and g
stewart adapted the world war ii era radar systems for meteor observations
the delta arietids are another meteor shower radiating from aries
peaking on december with a low peak rate the shower lasts from december to january with the highest rates visible from to december
the average delta arietid meteor is very slow with an average velocity of per second
however this shower sometimes produces bright fireballs
this meteor shower has northern and southern components both of which are likely associated with ha a near earth asteroid
the autumn arietids also radiate from aries
the shower lasts from september to october and peaks on october
its peak rate is low
the epsilon arietids appear from to october
other meteor showers radiating from aries include the october delta arietids daytime epsilon arietids daytime may arietids sigma arietids nu arietids and beta arietids
the sigma arietids a class iv meteor shower are visible from to october with a maximum zenithal hourly rate of less than two meteors per hour on october
aries contains several stars with extrasolar planets
hip a g type star is orbited by three giant planets
hd like hip is a g type main sequence star slightly larger than the sun with two orbiting planets
one planet is times the mass of jupiter and the other is times the mass of jupiter
hd is a g type star approximately the size of the sun with one orbiting planet
the planet discovered in has a mass times that of jupiter and orbits every days
in scientists conducting the carmenes survey at the calar alto observatory announced evidence of two earth mass exoplanets orbiting teegardens star located in aries within its habitable zone
the star is a small red dwarf with only around a tenth of the mass and radius of the sun
it has a large radial velocity
simbad aquarius is an equatorial constellation of the zodiac between capricornus and pisces
its name is latin for water carrier or cup carrier and its old astronomical symbol is a representation of water
aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac
it was one of the constellations listed by the nd century astronomer ptolemy and it remains one of the modern constellations
it is found in a region often called the sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as cetus the whale pisces the fish and eridanus the river
at apparent magnitude beta aquarii is the brightest star in the constellation
aquarius is identified as the great one in the babylonian star catalogues and represents the god ea himself who is commonly depicted holding an overflowing vase
the babylonian star figure appears on entitlement stones and cylinder seals from the second millennium
it contained the winter solstice in the early bronze age
in old babylonian astronomy ea was the ruler of the southernmost quarter of the suns path the way of ea corresponding to the period of days on either side of winter solstice
aquarius was also associated with the destructive floods that the babylonians regularly experienced and thus was negatively connoted
in ancient egypt astronomy aquarius was associated with the annual flood of the nile the banks were said to flood when aquarius put his jar into the river beginning spring
in the greek tradition the constellation came to be represented simply as a single vase from which a stream poured down to piscis austrinus
the name in the hindu zodiac is likewise kumbha water pitcher
in greek mythology aquarius is sometimes associated with deucalion the son of prometheus who built a ship with his wife pyrrha to survive an imminent flood
they sailed for nine days before washing ashore on mount parnassus
aquarius is also sometimes identified with beautiful ganymede a youth in greek mythology and the son of trojan king tros who was taken to mount olympus by zeus to act as cup carrier to the gods
neighboring aquila represents the eagle under zeus command that snatched the young boy some versions of the myth indicate that the eagle was in fact zeus transformed
an alternative version of the tale recounts ganymedes kidnapping by the goddess of the dawn eos motivated by her affection for young men zeus then stole him from eos and employed him as cup bearer
yet another figure associated with the water bearer is cecrops i a king of athens who sacrificed water instead of wine to the gods
in the first century ptolemys almagest established the common western depiction of aquarius
his water jar an asterism itself consists of gamma pi eta and zeta aquarii it pours water in a stream of more than stars terminating with fomalhaut now assigned solely to piscis austrinus
the water bearers head is represented by th magnitude aquarii while his left shoulder is beta aquarii his right shoulder and forearm are represented by alpha and gamma aquarii respectively
in chinese astronomy the stream of water flowing from the water jar was depicted as the army of yu lin
the name yu lin means feathers and forests referring to the numerous light footed soldiers from the northern reaches of the empire represented by these faint stars
the constellations stars were the most numerous of any chinese constellation numbering the majority of which were located in modern aquarius
the celestial army was protected by the wall leibizhen which counted iota lambda phi and sigma aquarii among its stars
and aquarii represent fou youe the axes used as weapons and for hostage executions
also in aquarius is loui pi tchin the ramparts that stretch from and piscium and and aquarii through phi lambda sigma and iota aquarii to delta gamma kappa and epsilon capricorni
near the border with cetus the axe fuyue was represented by three stars its position is disputed and may have instead been located in sculptor
tienliecheng also has a disputed position the star castle replete with ramparts may have possessed nu and xi aquarii but may instead have been located south in piscis austrinus
the water jar asterism was seen to the ancient chinese as the tomb fenmu
nearby the emperors mausoleum xiuliang stood demarcated by kappa aquarii and three other collinear stars
ku and qi each composed of two stars were located in the same region
three of the chinese lunar mansions shared their name with constellations
nu also the name for the th lunar mansion was a handmaiden represented by epsilon mu and aquarii
the th lunar mansion shared its name with the constellation xu formed by beta aquarii and alpha equulei it represented a bleak place associated with death and funerals
wei the rooftop and th lunar mansion was a v shaped constellation formed by alpha aquarii theta pegasi and epsilon pegasi it shared its name with two other chinese constellations in modern day scorpius and aries
despite both its prominent position on the zodiac and its large size aquarius has no particularly bright stars its four brightest stars being less than however recent research has shown that there are several stars lying within its borders that possess planetary systems
the two brightest stars aquarii and aquarii are luminous yellow supergiants of spectral types gib and gib respectively that were once hot blue white b class main sequence stars to times as massive as the sun
the two are also moving through space perpendicular to the plane of the milky way
just shading aquarii is the brightest star in aquarius with apparent it also has the proper name of sadalsuud
having cooled and swollen to around times the suns diameter it is around times as luminous as the sun
it is around times as massive as the sun and around million years old
sadalsuud is from earth
aquarii also known as sadalmelik has apparent it is distant from earth and is around times as massive as the sun and times as luminous
it is million years old
aquarii also called sadachbia is a white main sequence star of spectral type star of spectral type av that is between and million years old and is around times the suns mass and double its radius
its magnitude is and it is away hence its luminosity is
the name sadachbia comes from the arabic for lucky stars of the tents sad al akhbiya
aquarii also known as skat or scheat is a blue white spectral type a star with apparent magnitude and luminosity
aquarii also known as albali is a blue white spectral type a star with apparent magnitude absolute magnitude and a luminosity of
aquarii is a spectral type f double star both stars are white
in combination they appear to be magnitude with luminosity
the primary has magnitude and the secondarys magnitude is but both have absolute the systems orbital period is years currently the two components are moving farther apart
aquarii sometimes called ancha is spectral type g with apparent magnitude and an absolute aquarii also called situla has an apparent aquarii also called hudoor or ekchusis is spectral type m with magnitude and luminosity
aquarii also called bunda is spectral type a with an apparent magnitude and an absolute aquarii also called seat is spectral type b with apparent magnitude and absolute twelve exoplanet systems have been found in aquarius as of
gliese one of the nearest stars to earth at a distance of light years was the first red dwarf star to be found to possess a planetary system
it is orbited by four planets including one terrestrial planet times the mass of earth
the planets vary in orbital period from days to days
aquarii is an orange giant star orbited by one planet aquarii b
the planets mass is times the mass of jupiter and its orbital period is days
gliese is a red dwarf star orbited by the first known long period jupiter like planet gliese b
the planets mass is times that of jupiter and its orbital period is days
there are also less prominent systems in aquarius
wasp a type g star of magnitude is host to one exoplanet wasp b
the star is parsecs from earth and has a mass of solar masses and a radius of solar radii
wasp b was discovered in by the transit method
it orbits its parent star every days at a distance of astronomical units
it is jupiter masses but has a proportionally larger radius of jupiter radii
hd a k star located parsecs from earth is host to one planet hd b
the host star is larger than the sun more massive at solar masses and larger at solar radii
the planet was discovered by the radial velocity method in and has a mass of jupiter masses
it orbits every days at a distance of au
much closer to its sun is wasp b which orbits every days only au from its sun yellow dwarf wasp
wasp is close in size to the sun having a radius of solar radii and a mass even closer at solar masses
wasp b was discovered in by the transit method like wasp b
it is slightly larger than jupiter with a mass of jupiter masses and a radius of jupiter masses
there are several more single planet systems in aquarius
hd a magnitude yellow star located parsecs from earth is host to one known planet hd b
the jupiter mass planet orbits at nearly the same distance as earth orbits the sun au though its orbital period is significantly longer at around days
hd b was discovered earlier than most of the other planets in aquarius detected by the radial velocity method in
the star it orbits resembles the sun beyond their similar spectral class it has a radius of solar radii and a mass of solar masses
hd b a larger planet at jupiter masses orbits host star hd at a distance of au
the star itself barely below the threshold of naked eye visibility at magnitude is a giv star located parsecs from earth
though it has a similar mass to the sun solar massesit is significantly less dense with its radius of solar radii
its lone planet was discovered in by the radial velocity method like several other exoplanets in the constellation
as of there were only two known multiple planet systems within the bounds of aquarius the gliese and hd systems
the former is quite prominent the latter has only two planets and has a host star farther away at parsecs
the hd system consists of the planets hd b and hd c orbiting their k type magnitude sun
both discovered in by the radial velocity method the two tiny planets orbit very close to their host star
hd c is the larger at jupiter masses its smaller sibling is barely smaller at jupiter masses
the error in the mass measurements is large enough to make this discrepancy statistically insignificant
hd c also orbits further from the star than hd b au compared to
on february nasa announced that ultracool dwarf star trappist in aquarius has seven earth like rocky planets
of these as many as four may lie within the systems habitable zone and may have liquid water on their surfaces
the discovery of the trappist system is seen by astronomers as a significant step toward finding life beyond earth
because of its position away from the galactic plane the majority of deep sky objects in aquarius are galaxies globular clusters and planetary nebulae
aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the messier catalog the globular clusters messier messier and the asterism messier
while m was originally catalogued as a sparsely populated open cluster modern analysis indicates the main stars are not close enough together to fit this definition reclassifying m as an asterism
two well known planetary nebulae are also located in aquarius the saturn nebula to the southeast of aquarii and the famous helix nebula southwest of aquarii
m also catalogued as ngc is a rich globular cluster located approximately light years from earth
at magnitude it is viewable in small aperture instruments but a mm aperture telescope is needed to resolve any stars
m also catalogued as ngc is a small th magnitude globular cluster located approximately light years from earth
m also catalogued as ngc is an open cluster with highly disputed status
aquarius is also home to several planetary nebulae
ngc also known as the saturn nebula is an th magnitude planetary nebula located light years from earth
it was given its moniker by the th century astronomer lord rosse for its resemblance to the planet saturn in a telescope it has faint protrusions on either side that resemble saturns rings
it appears blue green in a telescope and has a central star of magnitude compared to the helix nebula another planetary nebula in aquarius it is quite small
ngc also known as the helix nebula is the closest planetary nebula to earth at a distance of light years
it covers square degrees making it also the largest planetary nebula as seen from earth
however because it is so large it is only viewable as a very faint object though it has a fairly high integrated magnitude of one of the visible galaxies in aquarius is ngc of particular interest for amateur astronomers who wish to discover or observe supernovae
a spiral galaxy it has an integrated magnitude of and is by arcseconds
ngc is a tangle of stars resulting from the collision of two large galaxies and is known as the atoms for peace galaxy because of its resemblance to a cartoon atom
there are three major meteor showers with radiants in aquarius the eta aquariids the delta aquariids and the iota aquariids
the eta aquariids are the strongest meteor shower radiating from aquarius
it peaks between and may with a rate of approximately meteors per hour
originally discovered by chinese astronomers in eta aquariids can be seen coming from the water jar beginning on april and as late as may
the parent body of the shower is halleys comet a periodic comet
fireballs are common shortly after the peak approximately between may and may
the normal meteors appear to have yellow trails
the delta aquariids is a double radiant meteor shower that peaks first on july and second on august
the first radiant is located in the south of the constellation while the second radiant is located in the northern circlet of pisces asterism
the southern radiants peak rate is about meteors per hour while the northern radiants peak rate is about meteors per hour
the iota aquariids is a fairly weak meteor shower that peaks on august with a rate of approximately meteors per hour
the sun appears in the constellation aquarius from february to march
in tropical astrology the sun is considered to be in the sign aquarius from january to february and in sidereal astrology from february to march
aquarius is also associated with the age of aquarius a concept popular in s counterculture and medieval alchemy
the date of the start of the age of aquarius is a topic of much debate
the earliest commercial japanese animations date to
a characteristic art style emerged in the s with the works of cartoonist osamu tezuka and spread in following decades developing a large domestic audience
anime is distributed theatrically through television broadcasts directly to home media and over the internet
in addition to original works anime are often adaptations of japanese comics light novels or video games
it is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences
anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies
it combines graphic art characterization cinematography and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques
compared to western animation anime production generally focuses less on movement and more on the detail of settings and use of camera effects such as panning zooming and angle shots
diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes
the anime industry consists of over production companies including major studios such as studio ghibli kyoto animation sunrise bones ufotable mappa wit studio comix wave films production ig and toei animation
since the s the medium has also seen widespread international success with the rise of foreign dubbed subtitled programming and since the s its increasing distribution through streaming services and a widening demographic embrace of anime culture both within japan and worldwide
as of japanese animation accounted for of the worlds animated television shows
as a type of animation anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself
in japanese the term anime is used to refer to all animated works regardless of style or origin
english language dictionaries typically define anime as a style of japanese animation or as a style of animation originating in japan
other definitions are based on origin making production in japan a requisite for a work to be considered anime
the etymology of the term anime is disputed
the english word animation is written in japanese katakana as and as in its shortened form
some sources claim that the term is derived from the french term for animation but others believe this to be a myth derived from the popularity of anime in france in the late s and s
in english anime when used as a common noun normally functions as a mass noun
as with a few other japanese words such as sak and pokmon english texts sometimes spell anime as anim with an acute accent over the final e to cue the reader to pronounce the letter not to leave it silent as english orthography may suggest
prior to the widespread use of anime the term japanimation a portmanteau of japan and animation was prevalent throughout the s and s
in the mid s the term anime began to supplant japanimation in general the latter term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify japanese animation
animation in japan began in the early th century when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in france germany the united states and russia
a claim for the earliest japanese animation is katsud shashin a private work by an unknown creator
in the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear animators such as ten shimokawa seitar kitayama and junichi kuchi produced numerous films the oldest surviving of which is kuchis namakura gatana
many early works were lost with the destruction of shimokawas warehouse in the great kant earthquake
by the mid s animation was well established in japan as an alternative format to the live action industry
it suffered competition from foreign producers such as disney and many animators including nobur fuji and yasuji murata continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation
other creators including kenz masaoka and mitsuyo seo nevertheless made great strides in technique benefiting from the patronage of the government which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda
in the government dissolved several artists organizations to form the the first talkie anime was chikara to onna no yo no naka a short film produced by masaoka
the first feature length anime film was produced by seo with a sponsorship from the imperial japanese navy
the s saw a proliferation of short animated advertisements created for television
in the s manga artist and animator osamu tezuka adapted and simplified disney animation techniques to reduce costs and limit frame counts in his productions
originally intended as temporary measures to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with an inexperienced staff many of his limited animation practices came to define the mediums style
three tales was the first anime film broadcast on television the first anime television series was instant history
an early and influential success was astro boy a television series directed by tezuka based on his manga of the same name
many animators at tezukas mushi production later established major anime studios
the s saw growth in the popularity of manga many of which were later animated
tezukas work and that of other pioneers in the field inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today
the giant robot genre for instance took shape under tezuka developed into the super robot genre under go nagai and others and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by yoshiyuki tomino who developed the real robot genre
robot anime series such as gundam and super dimension fortress macross became instant classics in the s and the genre remained one of the most popular in the following decades
the bubble economy of the s spurred a new era of high budget and experimental anime films including nausica of the valley of the wind and akira
neon genesis evangelion a television series produced by gainax and directed by hideaki anno began another era of experimental anime titles such as ghost in the shell and cowboy bebop
in the s anime also began attracting greater interest in western countries major international successes include sailor moon and dragon ball z both of which were dubbed into more than a dozen languages worldwide
in spirited away a studio ghibli feature film directed by hayao miyazaki won the academy award for best animated feature at the th academy awards
it later became the highest grossing anime film earning more than million
since the s an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels successful examples include the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and fate stay night
became the highest grossing japanese film and one of the worlds highest grossing films of
it also became the fastest grossing film in japanese cinema because in days it made billion yen
it beat the previous record of spirited away which took days
anime differs from other forms of animation by its art styles methods of animation its production and its process
visually anime works exhibit a wide variety of art styles differing between creators artists and studios
while no single art style predominates anime as a whole they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design
anime is fundamentally characterized by the use of limited animation flat expression the suspension of time its thematic range the presence of historical figures its complex narrative line and above all a peculiar drawing style with characters characterized by large and oval eyes with very defined lines bright colors and reduced movement of the lips
modern anime follows a typical animation production process involving storyboarding voice acting character design and cel production
since the s animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process
early anime works were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards stop motion animation of paper cutouts and silhouette animation
cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium
in the st century the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by tadahito mochinaga kihachir kawamoto and tomoyasu murata
computers were integrated into the animation process in the s with works such as ghost in the shell and princess mononoke mixing cel animation with computer generated images
fuji film a major cel production company announced it would stop cel production producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes
prior to the digital era anime was produced with traditional animation methods using a pose to pose approach
the majority of mainstream anime uses fewer expressive key frames and more in between animation
japanese animation studios were pioneers of many limited animation techniques and have given anime a distinct set of conventions
unlike disney animation where the emphasis is on the movement anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement
such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices
anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three dimensional views and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work
the backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations as exemplified in howls moving castle and the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya
oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all star cast usually comes out looking tremendously impressive
the cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in american animation
anime is cinematically shot as if by camera including panning zooming distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality
in anime the animation is produced before the voice acting contrary to american animation which does the voice acting first
the body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality
the height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion
head heights can vary but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall
anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce super deformed characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall
some anime works like crayon shin chan completely disregard these proportions in such a way that they resemble caricatured western cartoons
a common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size
the animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to osamu tezuka who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as betty boop who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes
tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes
the artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth
generally a mixture of a light shade the tone color and a dark shade is used
cultural anthropologist rachel thorn argues that japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign
however not all anime characters have large eyes
for example the works of hayao miyazaki are known for having realistically proportioned eyes as well as realistic hair colors on their characters
hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled
the movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and hair action is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect
poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga where eye catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for childrens manga
despite being produced for a domestic market anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined and this is often a deliberate decision such as in the pokmon animated series
anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts
these techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in western animation and they include a fixed iconography that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods
for example a male character may develop a nosebleed when aroused
a variety of visual symbols are employed including sweat drops to depict nervousness visible blushing for embarrassment or glowing eyes for an intense glare
another recurring sight gag is the use of chibi figures to comedically punctuate emotions like confusion or embarrassment
the opening and credits sequences of most anime television series are accompanied by j pop or j rock songs often by reputed bands as written with the series in mind but are also aimed at the general music market therefore they often allude only vaguely or not at all to the thematic settings or plot of the series
also they are often used as incidental music in an episode in order to highlight particularly important scenes
future funk a musical microgenre that evolved in the early s from vaporwave with a french house euro disco influence heavily uses anime visuals and samples along with japanese city pop to build an aesthetic
anime are often classified by target demographic including and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience
shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal
adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences may typically find unappealing as well as adult themes and situations
a subset of adult anime works featuring pornographic elements are labeled r in japan and are internationally known as hentai
by contrast some anime subgenres incorporate ecchi sexual themes or undertones without depictions of sexual intercourse as typified in the comedic or harem genres due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts the inclusion of such elements is considered a form of fan service
some genres explore homosexual romances such as yaoi and yuri
while often used in a pornographic context the terms yaoi and yuri can also be used broadly in a wider context to describe or focus on the themes or the development of the relationships themselves
animes genre classification differs from other types of animation and does not lend itself to simple classification
gilles poitras compared the labeling gundam and its complex depiction of war as a giant robot anime akin to simply labeling war and peace a war novel
science fiction is a major anime genre and includes important historical works like tezukas astro boy and yokoyamas tetsujin go
a major subgenre of science fiction is mecha with the gundam metaseries being iconic
the diverse fantasy genre includes works based on asian and western traditions and folklore examples include the japanese feudal fairytale inuyasha and the depiction of scandinavian goddesses who move to japan to maintain a computer called yggdrasil in ah my goddess
genre crossing in anime is also prevalent such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in dragon half and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film castle of cagliostro
other subgenres found in anime include magical girl harem sports martial arts literary adaptations medievalism and war
early anime works were made for theatrical viewing and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production
in nippon television aired mogura no abanchru both the first televised and first color anime to debut
it was not until the s when the first televised series were broadcast and it has remained a popular medium since
works released in a direct to video format are called original video animation or original animation video and are typically not released theatrically or televised prior to home media release
the emergence of the internet has led some animators to distribute works online in a format called original net animation
the home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the s with the vhs and laserdisc formats
the vhs ntsc video format used in both japan and the united states is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the s
the laserdisc and vhs formats were transcended by the dvd format which offered the unique advantages including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc
the dvd format also has its drawbacks in its usage of region coding adopted by the industry to solve licensing piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the dvd player
the video cd format was popular in hong kong and taiwan but became only a minor format in the united states that was closely associated with bootleg copies
a key characteristic of many anime television shows is serialization where a continuous story arc stretches over multiple episodes or seasons
traditional american television had an episodic format with each episode typically consisting of a self contained story
in contrast anime shows such as dragon ball z had a serialization format where continuous story arcs stretch over multiple episodes or seasons which distinguished them from traditional american television shows serialization has since also become a common characteristic of american streaming television shows during the peak tv era
the animation industry consists of more than production companies with some of the major studios including toei animation gainax madhouse gonzo sunrise bones tms entertainment nippon animation paworks studio pierrot production ig ufotable and studio ghibli
many of the studios are organized into a trade association the association of japanese animations
there is also a labor union for workers in the industry the japanese animation creators association
studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects as done with studio ghiblis spirited away
an anime episode can cost between us and us to produce
in animation accounted for of the japanese film market above the market share for live action works
the popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the dvd market contributing nearly of total sales
according to a article on nikkei asian review japanese television stations have bought over worth of anime from production companies over the past few years compared with under from overseas
there has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in japan caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic
this type of anime is less popular outside japan being considered more of a niche product
spirited away was the all time highest grossing film in japan until overtaken by in
it was also the highest grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by makoto shinkais film your name
anime films represent a large part of the highest grossing japanese films yearly in japan with out of the top in in and also in
anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released
while anime has been licensed by its japanese owners for use outside japan since at least the s the practice became well established in the united states in the late s to early s when such tv series as gatchaman and captain harlock were licensed from their japanese parent companies for distribution in the us market
the trend towards american distribution of anime continued into the s with the licensing of titles such as voltron and the creation of new series such as robotech through use of source material from several original series
in the early s several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children oriented material
some such as ad vision and central park media and its imprints achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative american anime market
others such as animeigo achieved limited success
many companies created directly by japanese parent companies did not do as well most releasing only one or two titles before completing their american operations
licenses are expensive often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie
the prices vary widely for example cost only to license while kurau phantom memory cost
simulcast internet streaming rights can be cheaper with prices around an episode but can also be more expensive with some series costing more than per episode
the anime market for the united states was worth approximately billion in
dubbed animation began airing in the united states in on networks like the wb and cartoon networks adult swim
in this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on cartoon network
as a part of localization some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non japanese culture
the cost of english localization averages us per episode
the industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films
fansubs which were originally distributed on vhs bootlegged cassettes in the s have been freely available and disseminated online since the s
since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed
they also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in english although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks
even so the laid back regulations of the japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity until there is a demand for official high quality releases for animation companies
this has led to an increase in global popularity with japanese animations reaching million in sales in
since the s anime has become a global multibillion industry setting a sales record in of trillion driven largely by demand from overseas audiences
in japans anime industry was valued at billion a year with of that revenue coming from overseas
by the anime industry is expected to reach a value of billion with over of that revenue to come from overseas
japan external trade organization valued the domestic anime market in japan at including from licensed products in
jetro reported sales of overseas anime exports in to be
jetro valued the anime market in the united states at including in home video sales and over from licensed products in
jetro projected in that the worldwide anime market including sales of licensed products would grow to
the anime market in china was valued at in and is projected to reach by
the global anime market size was valued at billion in with of the revenue coming from merchandise
it is expected that the global anime market will reach a value of billion by
by the global anime market is expected to reach a value of billion with the largest contributors to this growth being north america europe china and the middle east
in the annual overseas exports of japanese animation exceeded billion for the first time in history
the anime industry has several annual awards that honor the years best works
major annual awards in japan include the fuji nobur award the mainichi film award for best animation film the animation kobe awards the japan media arts festival animation awards the seiyu awards for voice actors the tokyo anime award and the japan academy prize for animation of the year
in the united states anime films compete in the crunchyroll anime awards
there were also the american anime awards which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry and were held only once in
anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime like the academy award for best animated feature or the golden bear
in recent years the anime industry has been accused by both japanese and foreign media for underpaying and overworking its animators
in response the japanese prime minister fumio kishida promised to improve the working conditions and salary of all animators and creators working in the industry
a few anime studios such as mappa have taken actions to improve the working conditions of their employees
there has also been a slight increase in production costs and animator pays during the covid pandemic
on april nippon anime film culture association was officially founded
the association aims to solve problems in the industry including the improvement of conditions of the workers
anime has become commercially profitable in western countries as demonstrated by early commercially successful western adaptations of anime such as astro boy and speed racer
early american adaptions in the s made japan expand into the continental european market first with productions aimed at european and japanese children such as heidi vicky the viking and barbapapa which aired in various countries
italy spain and france grew a particular interest into japans output due to its cheap selling price and productive output
as of italy imported the most anime outside japan
anime and manga were introduced to france in the late s and because massively popular in spite of a moral panic led by french politicians in the s and s
these mass imports influenced anime popularity in south american arabic and german markets
the beginning of saw the introduction of japanese anime series into the american culture
in the s japanese animation slowly gained popularity in america
media companies such as viz and mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the american market
the film akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the western world during the early s before anime was further popularized by television shows such as pokmon and dragon ball z in the late s
by japanese anime was the fastest growing genre in the american video industry
the growth of the internet later provided international audiences an easy way to access japanese content
early on online piracy played a major role in this through over time many legal alternatives appeared
since the s various streaming services have become increasingly involved in the production and licensing of anime for the international markets
this is especially the case with net services such as netflix and crunchyroll which have large catalogs in western countries although as of anime fans in many developing non western countries such as india and philippines have fewer options of obtaining access to legal content and therefore still turn to online piracy
however beginning with the s anime has been experiencing yet another boom in global popularity and demand due to the covid pandemic and streaming services like netflix amazon prime video hbo max hulu and anime only services like crunchyroll and hidive increasing the international availability of the amount of new licensed anime shows as well as the size of their catalogs

rising interest in anime as well as japanese video games has led to an increase of university students in the united kingdom wanting to get a degree in the japanese language
the word anime alongside other japanese pop cultural terms like shonen and shojo have been added to the oxford english dictionary
various anime and manga series have influenced hollywood in the making of numerous famous movies and characters
hollywood itself has produced live action adaptations of various anime series such as ghost in the shell death note dragon ball evolution and cowboy bebop
however most of these adaptations have been reviewed negatively by both the critics and the audience and have become box office flops
the main reasons for the unsuccessfulness of hollywoods adaptions of anime being the often change of plot and characters from the original source material and the limited capabilities a live action movie or series can do in comparison to an animated counterpart
one particular exception however is which has become a moderate commercial success receiving generally positive reviews from both the critics and the audience for its visual effects and following the source material
the movie grossed million worldwide making it director robert rodriguezs highest grossing film
anime and manga alongside many other parts of japanese pop culture have helped japan to gain a positive worldwide image and improve its relations with other countries
in during remarks welcoming japanese prime minister shinzo abe to the white house president barack obama thanked japan for its cultural contributions to the united states by saying in july after the approval of a chilean government project in which citizens of chile would be allowed to withdraw up to of their privately held retirement savings journalist pamela jiles celebrated by running through congress with her arms spread out behind her imitating the move of many characters of the anime and manga series naruto
in april peruvian politicians jorge hugo romero of the ppc and milagros jurez of the upp cosplayed as anime characters to get the otaku vote
in april the japan business federation laid out a proposal aiming to spur the economic growth of japan by further promoting the contents industry abroad primarily anime manga and video games for measures to invite industry experts from abroad to come to japan to work and to link with the tourism sector to help foreign fans of manga and anime visit sites across the country associated with particular manga stories
the federation seeks on quadrupling the sales of japanese content in overseas markets within the upcoming years
a survey conducted in countries and territories using a sample consisting of respondents held by dentsu revealed that of all surveyed people found excellency in anime and manga more than other japanese cultural or technological aspects which makes this mass japanese media the rd most liked japanese thing below japanese cuisine and japanese robotics
the advertisement company views anime as a profitable tool for marketing campaigns in foreign countries due its popularity and high reception
anime plays a role in driving tourism to japan
in surveys held by statista between and of tourists from the united states of tourists from china and of tourists from south korea said they were motivated to visit japan because of japanese popular culture
in a survey held by crunchyroll market research of gen zs and of the general population said that they are familiar with anime
anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the s with the anime boom a period marked by animes increased global popularity
these conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels
cosplay a portmanteau of costume play is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions
japanese culture and words have entered english usage through the popularity of the medium including otaku an unflattering japanese term commonly used in english to denote an obsessive fan of anime and or manga
another word that has arisen describing obsessive fans in the united states is wapanese meaning white individuals who want to be japanese or later known as weeaboo or weeb individuals who demonstrate an obsession in japanese anime subculture a term that originated from abusive content posted on the website chanorg
while originally derogatory the terms otaku and weeb have been reappropriated by the anime fandom overtime and today are used by some fans to refer to themselves in a comedic and more positive way
anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art including computer wallpapers and anime music videos
many fans will visit sites depicted in anime games manga and other forms of otaku culture this behavior is known as anime pilgrimage
as of the s many anime fans and followers use social media platforms and other sites like youtube fandom facebook reddit discord tumblr chan tiktok and twitter with online communities and databases such as myanimelist to discuss anime manga and track their progress watching respective series as well as using news outlets such as anime news network
due to animes increased popularity in recent years a large number of celebrities such as elon musk bts and ariana grande have come out as anime fans
one of the key points that made anime different from a handful of western cartoons is the potential for visceral content
once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being just for children is put aside the audience can realize that themes involving violence suffering sexuality pain and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime just as much as other media
however as anime itself became increasingly popular its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions
south parks chinpokomon and good times with weapons episodes adult swims perfect hair forever and nickelodeons kappa mikey are examples of western satirical depictions of japanese culture and anime but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime such as konosuba
traditionally only japanese works have been considered anime but some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between anime and cartoons such as the american anime style productions and
these anime styled works have become defined as anime influenced animation in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non japanese origin
some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration for example the french production team for ban star racers that moved to tokyo to collaborate with a japanese production team
when anime is defined as a style rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries but this has been contentious amongst fans with john oppliger stating the insistence on referring to original american art as japanese anime or manga robs the work of its cultural identity
a uae filipino produced tv series called torkaizer is dubbed as the middle easts first anime show and is currently in production and looking for funding
netflix has produced multiple anime series in collaboration with japanese animation studios and in doing so has offered a more accessible channel for distribution to western markets
the web based series rwby produced by texas based company rooster teeth is produced using an anime art style and the series has been described as anime by multiple sources
for example adweek in the headline to one of its articles described the series as american made anime and in another headline the huffington post described it as simply anime without referencing its country of origin
in monty oum the creator of rwby said some believe just like scotch needs to be made in scotland an american company cant make anime
i think thats a narrow way of seeing it
anime is an art form and to say only one country can make this art is wrong
rwby has been released in japan with a japanese language dub the ceo of rooster teeth matt hullum commented this is the first time any american made anime has been marketed to japan
it definitely usually works the other way around and were really pleased about that
in japanese culture and entertainment media mix is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations different broadcast media gaming technologies cell phones toys amusement parks and other methods
it is the japanese term for a transmedia franchise
the term gained its circulation in late s but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the s with the proliferation of anime with its interconnection of media and commodity goods
a number of anime and manga media franchises such as dragon ball and gundam have gained considerable global popularity and are among the worlds highest grossing media franchises
pokmon in particular is estimated to be the highest grossing media franchise of all time
ankara historically known as ancyra and angora is the capital of turkey
located in the central part of anatolia the city has a population of million in its urban center and million in ankara province making it turkeys second largest city after istanbul but first by the urban area
serving as the capital of the ancient celtic state of galatia and later of the roman province with the same name the city is very old with various hattian hittite lydian phrygian galatian greek persian roman byzantine and ottoman archeological sites
the ottomans made the city the capital first of the anatolia eyalet and then the angora eyalet and the angora vilayet
the historical center of ankara is a rocky hill rising over the left bank of the ankara river a tributary of the sakarya river
the hill remains crowned by the ruins of ankara castle
although few of its outworks have survived there are well preserved examples of roman and ottoman architecture throughout the city the most remarkable being the bc temple of augustus and rome that boasts the monumentum ancyranum the inscription recording the
on april the grand national assembly of turkey was established in ankara which became the headquarters of the turkish national movement during the turkish war of independence
ankara became the new turkish capital upon the establishment of the republic on october succeeding in this role as the former turkish capital istanbul following the fall of the ottoman empire
the government is a prominent employer but ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city located at the center of turkeys road and railway networks
the city gave its name to the angora wool shorn from angora rabbits the long haired angora goat and the angora cat
the area is also known for its pears honey and muscat grapes
although situated in one of the driest regions of turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant at per head
the orthography of the name ankara has varied over the ages
it has been identified with the hittite cult center ankuwa although this remains a matter of debate
in classical antiquity and during the medieval period the city was known as nkyra in greek and ancyra in latin the galatian celtic name was probably a similar variant
following its annexation by the seljuk turks in the city became known in many european languages as angora it was also known in ottoman turkish as engr
the form angora is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals and in the names of several locations in the us
the regions history can be traced back to the bronze age hattic civilization which was succeeded in the nd millennium bc by the hittites in the th century bc by the phrygians and later by the lydians persians greeks galatians romans byzantines and turks
the oldest settlements in and around the city center of ankara belonged to the hattic civilization which existed during the bronze age and was gradually absorbed c
bc by the indo european hittites
the city grew significantly in size and importance under the phrygians starting around bc and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from gordion after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time
in phrygian tradition king midas was venerated as the founder of ancyra but pausanias mentions that the city was actually far older which accords with present archeological knowledge
phrygian rule was succeeded first by lydian and later by persian rule though the strongly phrygian character of the peasantry remained as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later roman period
persian sovereignty lasted until the persians defeat at the hands of alexander the great who conquered the city in bc
alexander came from gordion to ankara and stayed in the city for a short period
after his death at babylon in bc and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals ankara and its environs fell into the share of antigonus
another important expansion took place under the greeks of pontos who came there around bc and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the black sea ports and crimea to the north assyria cyprus and lebanon to the south and georgia armenia and persia to the east
by that time the city also took its name which in slightly modified form provides the modern name of ankara
in bc the city along with the rest of central anatolia was occupied by a celtic group the galatians who were the first to make ankara one of their main tribal centers the headquarters of the tectosages tribe
other centers were pessinus todays ballhisar for the trocmi tribe and tavium to the east of ankara for the tolistobogii tribe
the city was then known as ancyra
the celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers a warrior aristocracy which ruled over phrygian speaking peasants
however the celtic language continued to be spoken in galatia for many centuries
at the end of the th century st
jerome a native of dalmatia observed that the language spoken around ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the roman world near trier
the city was subsequently passed under the control of the roman empire
in bc emperor augustus raised it to the status of a polis and made it the capital city of the roman province of galatia
ankara is famous for the monumentum ancyranum which contains the official record of the acts of augustus known as the res gestae divi augusti an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple
the ruins of ancyra still furnish today valuable bas reliefs inscriptions and other architectural fragments
two other galatian tribal centers tavium near yozgat and pessinus to the west near sivrihisar continued to be reasonably important settlements in the roman period but it was ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis
an estimated people lived in ancyra in good times during the roman empire a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the roman empire until the early th century
the small ankara river ran through the center of the roman town
it has now been covered and diverted but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the roman byzantine and ottoman periods
ankaya the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center stood well outside the roman city but may have been a summer resort
in the th century the remains of at least one roman villa or large house were still standing not far from where the ankaya presidential residence stands today
to the west the roman city extended until the area of the genlik park and railway station while on the southern side of the hill it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by hacettepe university
it was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the roman towns of gaul or britannia
ancyras importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern anatolia running north south and east west intersected giving it major strategic importance for romes eastern frontier
the great imperial road running east passed through ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way
they were not the only ones to use the roman highway network which was equally convenient for invaders
in the second half of the rd century ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the goths coming from the west and later by the arabs
for about a decade the town was one of the western outposts of one of palmyrean empress zenobia in the syrian desert who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the roman empire to set up a short lived state of her own
the town was reincorporated into the roman empire under emperor aurelian in
the tetrarchy a system of multiple emperors introduced by diocletian seems to have engaged in a substantial program of rebuilding and of road construction from ancyra westwards to germe and dorylaeum
in its heyday roman ancyra was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital where a high official ruled from the citys praetorium a large administrative palace or office
during the rd century life in ancyra as in other anatolian towns seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town
the city is well known during the th century as a center of christian activity due to frequent imperial visits and through the letters of the pagan scholar libanius
bishop marcellus of ancyra and basil of ancyra were active in the theological controversies of their day and the city was the site of no fewer than three church synods in and the latter two in favor of arianism
the city was visited by emperor constans i in and julian during his persian campaign in and julians successor jovian in winter
after jovians death soon after valentinian i was acclaimed emperor at ancyra and in the next year his brother valens used ancyra as his base against the usurper procopius
when the province of galatia was divided sometime in ancyra remained the civil capital of galatia i as well as its ecclesiastical center
emperor arcadius frequently used the city as his summer residence and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early th century is found in the works of palladius of galatia and nilus of ancyra
in the rebel marcian attacked the city without being able to capture it
in comentiolus brother of emperor phocas launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against heraclius
ten years later in or more likely it was captured by the sassanid persians during the byzantine sassanid war of
although the city returned to byzantine hands after the end of the war the persian presence left traces in the citys archeology and likely began the process of its transformation from a late antique city to a medieval fortified settlement
in the city also known in arabic sources as qalat as salasil was captured for the first time by the arabs of the rashidun caliphate under muawiyah the future founder of the umayyad caliphate
at about the same time the themes were established in anatolia and ancyra became capital of the opsician theme which was the largest and most important theme until it was split up under emperor constantine v ancyra then became the capital of the new bucellarian theme
the city was captured at least temporarily by the umayyad prince maslama ibn hisham in the last of the umayyads territorial gains from the byzantine empire
ancyra was attacked without success by abbasid forces in and in
in emperor nikephoros i strengthened its fortifications a fact which probably saved it from sack during the large scale invasion of anatolia by caliph harun al rashid in the next year
arab sources report that harun and his successor al mamun took the city but this information is later invention
in however during the amorium campaign the armies of caliph al mutasim converged and met at the city abandoned by its inhabitants ancara was razed to the ground before the arab armies went on to besiege and destroy amorium reaching as far as smyrna
in emperor michael iii came to the city during a campaign against the arabs and ordered its fortifications restored
in the city was menaced but not taken by the paulicians under chrysocheir
the last arab raid to reach the city was undertaken in by the abbasid governor of tarsus thamal al dulafi but the city again was not captured
early christian martyrs of ancyra about whom little is known included proklos and hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of kallippi and suffered repression under the emperor trajan
in the s we hear of philumenos a christian corn merchant from southern anatolia being captured and martyred in ankara and eustathius
as in other roman towns the reign of diocletian marked the culmination of the persecution of the christians
in ancyra was one of the towns where the co emperors diocletian and his deputy galerius launched their anti christian persecution
in ancyra their first target was the year old bishop of the town whose name was clement
clements life describes how he was taken to rome then sent back and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he and his brother and various companions were put to death
the remains of the church of st
clement can be found today in a building just off iklar caddesi in the ulus district
quite possibly this marks the site where clement was originally buried
four years later a doctor of the town named plato and his brother antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under galerius
theodotus of ancyra is also venerated as a saint
however the persecution proved unsuccessful and in ancyra was the center of an important council of the early church its disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the sacrament of penance
the synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the christian church after the persecutions and in particular the treatment of lapsi christians who had given in to forced paganism to avoid martyrdom during these persecutions
though paganism was probably tottering in ancyra in clements day it may still have been the majority religion
twenty years later christianity and monotheism had taken its place
ancyra quickly turned into a christian city with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes
the town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead
during the middle of the th century ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of christ and a form of arianism seems to have originated there
in emperor julian passed through ancyra on his way to an ill fated campaign against the persians and according to christian sources engaged in a persecution of various holy men
the stone base for a statue with an inscription describing julian as lord of the whole world from the british ocean to the barbarian nations can still be seen built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of ankara castle
the column of julian which was erected in honor of the emperors visit to the city in still stands today
in arian bishops met at ancyra and deposed several bishops among them st
gregory of nyssa
in the late th century ancyra became something of an imperial holiday resort
after constantinople became the east roman capital emperors in the th and th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the bosporus to the drier mountain atmosphere of ancyra
theodosius ii kept his court in ancyra in the summers
laws issued in ancyra testify to the time they spent there
the metropolis of ancyra continued to be a residential see of the eastern orthodox church until the th century with about faithful mostly turkish speaking but that situation ended as a result of the convention concerning the exchange of greek and turkish populations
the earlier armenian genocide put an end to the residential eparchy of ancyra of the armenian catholic church which had been established in
it is also a titular metropolis of the ecumenical patriarchate of constantinople
both the ancient byzantine metropolitan archbishopric and the modern armenian eparchy are now listed by the catholic church as titular sees with separate apostolic successions
after the battle of manzikert in the seljuk turks overran much of anatolia
by the turkish settlers had reached the vicinity of ancyra and the city was captured shortly after at the latest by the time of the rebellion of nikephoros melissenos in
in when the crusade under raymond iv of toulouse arrived the city had been under danishmend control for some time
the crusaders captured the city and handed it over to the byzantine emperor alexios i komnenos
byzantine rule did not last long and the city was captured by the seljuk sultanate of rum at some unknown point in it returned to danishmend control until when the seljuks of rum retook it
after the battle of kse da in in which the mongols defeated the seljuks most of anatolia became part of the dominion of the mongols
taking advantage of seljuk decline a semi religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ahiler chose angora as their independent city state in
orhan i the second bey of the ottoman empire captured the city in
timur defeated bayezid i at the battle of ankara in and took the city but in angora was again under ottoman control
the levant company maintained a factory in the town from to
in the th century its population was estimated at to
it was sacked by egyptians under ibrahim pasha in
from to the city served as the capital of the angora vilayet which included most of ancient galatia
prior to world war i the town had a british consulate and a population of around roughly of whom were christian
following the ottoman defeat in world war i the ottoman capital constantinople and much of anatolia was occupied by the allies who planned to share these lands between armenia france greece italy and the united kingdom leaving for the turks the core piece of land in central anatolia
in response the leader of the turkish nationalist movement mustafa kemal atatrk established the headquarters of his resistance movement in angora in
after the turkish war of independence was won and the treaty of svres was superseded by the treaty of lausanne the turkish nationalists replaced the ottoman empire with the republic of turkey on october
a few days earlier angora had officially replaced constantinople as the new turkish capital city on october and republican officials declared that the citys name is ankara
after ankara became the capital of the newly founded republic of turkey new development divided the city into an old section called ulus and a new section called yeniehir
ancient buildings reflecting roman byzantine and ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section
the new section now centered on kzlay square has the trappings of a more modern city wide streets hotels theaters shopping malls and high rises

when ankara became the capital of the republic of turkey in it was designated as a planned city for future inhabitants
during the s s and s the city grew in a planned and orderly pace
however from the s onward the city grew much faster than envisioned because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living
as a result many illegal houses called gecekondu were built around the city causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of ankara as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough
although precariously built the vast majority of them have electricity running water and modern household amenities
nevertheless many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of tower blocks such as elvankent eryaman and gzelkent and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation

the province of ankara is divided into districts
the chps key and almost only political stronghold in ankara lies within the central area of ankaya which is the citys most populous district
while the chp has always gained between and of the vote in ankaya since political support elsewhere throughout ankara is minimal
the high population within ankaya as well as yenimahalle to an extent has allowed the chp to take overall second place behind the ak party in both local and general elections with the mhp a close third despite the fact that the mhp is politically stronger than the chp in almost every other district
overall the ak party enjoys the most support throughout the city
the electorate of ankara thus tend to vote in favor of the political right far more so than the other main cities of istanbul and izmir

ankara is noted within turkey for the multitude of universities it is home to
these include the following several of them being among the most reputable in the country ankara is home to a world famous domestic cat breed the turkish angora called ankara kedisi in turkish
turkish angoras are one of the ancient naturally occurring cat breeds having originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia
they mostly have a white silky medium to long length coat no undercoat and a fine bone structure
there seems to be a connection between the angora cats and persians and the turkish angora is also a distant cousin of the turkish van
although they are known for their shimmery white coat there are more than twenty varieties including black blue and reddish fur
they come in tabby and tabby white along with smoke varieties and are in every color other than pointed lavender and cinnamon eyes may be blue green or amber or even one blue and one amber or green
the w gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located
however a great many blue and odd eyed white cats have normal hearing and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors
ears are pointed and large eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile
another characteristic is the tail which is often kept parallel to the back
the angora goat is a breed of domestic goat that originated in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia
this breed was first mentioned in the time of moses roughly in bc
the first angora goats were brought to europe by charles v holy roman emperor about but like later imports were not very successful
angora goats were first introduced in the united states in by dr james p
seven adult goats were a gift from sultan abdlmecid i in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton
the fleece taken from an angora goat is called mohair
a single goat produces between of hair per year
angoras are shorn twice a year unlike sheep which are shorn only once
angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth
a poor quality diet will curtail mohair development
the united states turkey and south africa are the top producers of mohair
for a long period of time angora goats were bred for their white coat
in the colored angora goat breeders association was set up to promote breeding of colored angoras
today angora goats produce white black red and brownish fiber
angora goats were depicted on the reverse of the turkish lira banknotes of emission group fifty turkish lira i
emission group fifty turkish lira i
series ii
series the angora rabbit is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long soft hair
the angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit originating in ankara and its surrounding region in central anatolia along with the angora cat and angora goat
the rabbits were popular pets with french royalty in the mid th century and spread to other parts of europe by the end of the century
they first appeared in the united states in the early th century
they are bred largely for their long angora wool which may be removed by shearing combing or plucking
angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft
they have a humorous appearance as they oddly resemble a fur ball
most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully
grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit
a condition called wool block is common in angora rabbits and should be treated quickly
sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat
arabic is a semitic language spoken primarily across the arab world
having emerged in the st century it is named after the arab people the term arab was initially used to describe those living in the arabian peninsula as perceived by geographers from ancient greece
since the th century arabic has been characterized by diglossia with an opposition between a standard prestige language ie literary arabic modern standard arabic or classical arabic and diverse vernacular varieties which serve as mother tongues
colloquial dialects vary significantly from msa impeding mutual intelligibility
msa is only acquired through formal education and is not spoken natively
it is the language of literature official documents and formal written media
in spoken form msa is used in formal contexts news bulletins and for prayers
this variety is the lingua franca of the arab world and the liturgical language of islam
it is an official language of states and disputed territory the third most after english and french
it is also one of six official languages of the united nations
spoken varieties are the usual medium of communication in all other domains
they are not standardized and vary significantly some of them being mutually unintelligible
the international organization for standardization assigns language codes to varieties of arabic including msa
arabic vernaculars do not descend from msa or classical arabic
combined arabic dialects have million native speakers while msa is spoken by million l speakers making it the sixth most spoken language in the world
arabic is traditionally written with the arabic alphabet a right to left abjad
this alphabet is the official script for msa
colloquial varieties were traditionally not written however with the emergence of social media the amount of written dialects has significantly increased online
besides the arabic alphabet dialects are also often written in latin from left to right or in hebrew characters with no standardized orthography
maltese and hassaniya are the only varieties officially written in a latin alphabet
arabic is usually classified as a central semitic language
linguists still differ as to the best classification of semitic language sub groups
the semitic languages changed significantly between proto semitic and the emergence of central semitic languages particularly in grammar
innovations of the central semitic languages all maintained in arabic include there are several features which classical arabic the modern arabic varieties as well as the safaitic and hismaic inscriptions share which are unattested in any other central semitic language variety including the dadanitic and taymanitic languages of the northern hejaz
these features are evidence of common descent from a hypothetical ancestor proto arabic
the following features can be reconstructed with confidence for proto arabic on the other hand several arabic varieties are closer to other semitic languages and maintain features not found in classical arabic indicating that these varieties cannot have developed from classical arabic
thus arabic vernaculars do not descend from classical arabic classical arabic is a sister language rather than their direct ancestor
arabia boasted a wide variety of semitic languages in antiquity
in the southwest various central semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the ancient south arabian family were spoken
it is also believed that the ancestors of the modern south arabian languages were also spoken in southern arabia at this time
to the north in the oases of northern hejaz dadanitic and taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages
in and parts of western arabia a language known to scholars as thamudic c is attested
in eastern arabia inscriptions in a script derived from asa attest to a language known as hasaitic
finally on the northwestern frontier of arabia various languages known to scholars as thamudic b thamudic d safaitic and hismaic are attested
the last two share important isoglosses with later forms of arabic leading scholars to theorize that safaitic and hismaic are in fact early forms of arabic and that they should be considered old arabic
linguists generally believe that old arabic first emerged around the st century ce
previously the earliest attestation of old arabic was thought to be a single st century ce inscription in sabaic script at in southern present day saudi arabia
however this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the arabic language group such as the conversion of semitic mimation to nunation in the singular
it is best reassessed as a separate language on the central semitic dialect continuum
it was also thought that old arabic coexisted alongside and then gradually displaced epigraphic ancient north arabian which was theorized to have been the regional tongue for many centuries
ana despite its name was considered a very distinct language and mutually unintelligible from arabic
scholars named its variant dialects after the towns where the inscriptions were discovered
however most arguments for a single ana language or language family were based on the shape of the definite article a prefixed h
it has been argued that the h is an archaism and not a shared innovation and thus unsuitable for language classification rendering the hypothesis of an ana language family untenable
safaitic and hismaic previously considered ana should be considered old arabic due to the fact that they participate in the innovations common to all forms of arabicthe earliest attestation of continuous arabic text in an ancestor of the modern arabic script are three lines of poetry by a man named garmallhe found in en avdat israel and dated to around ce
this is followed by the namara inscription an epitaph of the king imru al qays bar amro dating to ce found at namaraa syria
from the th to the th centuries the nabataean script evolves into the arabic script recognizable from the early islamic era
there are inscriptions in an undotted letter arabic script dating to the th century ce found at four locations in syria
the oldest surviving papyrus in arabic dates to ce and it uses dots to produce the modern letter arabic alphabet
the language of that papyrus and of the quran are referred to by linguists as quranic arabic as distinct from its codification soon thereafter into classical arabic
in late pre islamic times a transdialectal and transcommunal variety of arabic emerged in the hejaz which continued living its parallel life after literary arabic had been institutionally standardized in the nd and rd century of the hijra most strongly in judeo christian texts keeping alive ancient features eliminated from the learned tradition
this variety and both its classicizing and lay iterations have been termed middle arabic in the past but they are thought to continue an old higazi register
it is clear that the orthography of the quran was not developed for the standardized form of classical arabic rather it shows the attempt on the part of writers to record an archaic form of old higazi
in the late th century ad a relatively uniform intertribal poetic koine distinct from the spoken vernaculars developed based on the bedouin dialects of najd probably in connection with the court of al ra
during the first islamic century the majority of arabic poets and arabic writing persons spoke arabic as their mother tongue
their texts although mainly preserved in far later manuscripts contain traces of non standardized classical arabic elements in morphology and syntax
abu al aswad al duali is credited with standardizing arabic grammar or an naw and pioneering a system of diacritics to differentiate consonants and indicate vocalization
al khalil ibn ahmad al farahidi compiled the first arabic dictionary kitb al ayn and is credited with establishing the rules of arabic prosody
al jahiz proposed to al akhfash al akbar an overhaul of the grammar of arabic but it would not come to pass for two centuries
the standardization of arabic reached completion around the end of the th century
the first comprehensive description of the arabiyya arabic sbawayhis al kitb is based first of all upon a corpus of poetic texts in addition to quran usage and bedouin informants whom he considered to be reliable speakers of the arabiyya
arabic spread with the spread of islam
following the early muslim conquests arabic gained vocabulary from middle persian and turkish
in the early abbasid period many classical greek terms entered arabic through translations carried out at baghdads house of wisdom
by the th century knowledge of classical arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the islamic world both for muslims and non muslims
for example maimonides the andalusi jewish philosopher authored works in judeo arabic arabic written in hebrew script
ibn jinni of mosul a pioneer in phonology wrote prolifically in the th century on arabic morphology and phonology in works such as kitb al munif kitb al mutasab and
ibn mada of cordoba realized the overhaul of arabic grammar first proposed by al jahiz years prior
the maghrebi lexicographer ibn manzur compiled lisn al arab a major reference dictionary of arabic in
charles fergusons koine theory claims that the modern arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the islamic conquests this view has been challenged in recent times
ahmad al jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of arabic on the eve of the conquests northern and central
the modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests
instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories
according to veersteegh and bickerton colloquial arabic dialects arose from pidginized arabic formed from contact between arabs and conquered peoples
pidginization and subsequent creolization among arabs and arabized peoples could explain relative morphological and phonological simplicity of vernacular arabic compared to classical and msa
in around the th and th centuries in al andalus the zajal and muwashah poetry forms developed in the dialectical arabic of cordoba and the maghreb
the nahda was a cultural and especially literary renaissance of the th century in which writers sought to fuse arabic and european forms of expression
according to james l
gelvin nahda writers attempted to simplify the arabic language and script so that it might be accessible to a wider audience
in the wake of the industrial revolution and european hegemony and colonialism pioneering arabic presses such as the amiri press established by muhammad ali dramatically changed the diffusion and consumption of arabic literature and publications
rifaa al tahtawi proposed the establishment of madrasat al alsun in and led a translation campaign that highlighted the need for a lexical injection in arabic to suit concepts of the industrial and post industrial age
in response a number of arabic academies modeled after the were established with the aim of developing standardized additions to the arabic lexicon to suit these transformations first in damascus then in cairo baghdad rabat amman and tunis
they review language development monitor new words and approve inclusion of new words into their published standard dictionaries
they also publish old and historical arabic manuscripts
in a bureau of arabization standardization was added to the educational cultural and scientific organization of the arab league
these academies and organizations have worked toward the arabization of the sciences creating terms in arabic to describe new concepts toward the standardization of these new terms throughout the arabic speaking world and toward the development of arabic as a world language
this gave rise to what western scholars call modern standard arabic
from the s arabization became a postcolonial nationalist policy in countries such as tunisia algeria morocco and sudan
arabic usually refers to standard arabic which western linguists divide into classical arabic and modern standard arabic
it could also refer to any of a variety of regional vernacular arabic dialects which are not necessarily mutually intelligible
classical arabic is the language found in the quran used from the period of pre islamic arabia to that of the abbasid caliphate
classical arabic is prescriptive according to the syntactic and grammatical norms laid down by classical grammarians and the vocabulary defined in classical dictionaries
modern standard arabic largely follows the grammatical standards of classical arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary
however it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties
much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the industrial and post industrial era especially in modern times
due to its grounding in classical arabic modern standard arabic is removed over a millennium from everyday speech which is construed as a multitude of dialects of this language
these dialects and modern standard arabic are described by some scholars as not mutually comprehensible
the former are usually acquired in families while the latter is taught in formal education settings
however there have been studies reporting some degree of comprehension of stories told in the standard variety among preschool aged children
the relation between modern standard arabic and these dialects is sometimes compared to that of classical latin and vulgar latin vernaculars in medieval and early modern europe
msa is the variety used in most current printed arabic publications spoken by some of the arabic media across north africa and the middle east and understood by most educated arabic speakers
literary arabic and standard arabic are less strictly defined terms that may refer to modern standard arabic or classical arabic
msa uses much classical vocabulary that is not present in the spoken varieties but deletes classical words that sound obsolete in msa
in addition msa has borrowed or coined many terms for concepts that did not exist in quranic times and msa continues to evolve
some words have been borrowed from other languages notice that transliteration mainly indicates spelling and not real pronunciation
however the current preference is to avoid direct borrowings preferring to either use loan translations or to coin new words using forms within existing roots
an earlier tendency was to redefine an older word although this has fallen into disuse newspaper other documentaries concerning kurosawas life and works produced posthumously include ancient egypt was a civilization in northeast africa situated in the nile valley
ancient egyptian civilization followed prehistoric egypt and coalesced around bc with the political unification of upper and lower egypt under menes
the history of ancient egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms separated by periods of relative instability known as intermediate periods the old kingdom of the early bronze age the middle kingdom of the middle bronze age and the new kingdom of the late bronze age
egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the new kingdom ruling much of nubia and a sizable portion of the levant after which it entered a period of slow decline
during the course of its history egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers including the hyksos the libyans the nubians the assyrians the achaemenid persians and the macedonians under alexander the great
the greek ptolemaic kingdom formed in the aftermath of alexanders death ruled egypt until bc when under cleopatra it fell to the roman empire and became a roman province
the success of ancient egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the nile river valley for agriculture
the predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops which supported a more dense population and social development and culture
with resources to spare the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions the early development of an independent writing system the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects trade with surrounding regions and a military intended to assert egyptian dominance
motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes religious leaders and administrators under the control of a pharaoh who ensured the cooperation and unity of the egyptian people in the context of an elaborate system of religious beliefs
the many achievements of the ancient egyptians include the quarrying surveying and construction techniques that supported the building of monumental pyramids temples and obelisks a system of mathematics a practical and effective system of medicine irrigation systems and agricultural production techniques the first known planked boats egyptian faience and glass technology new forms of literature and the earliest known peace treaty made with the hittites
ancient egypt has left a lasting legacy
its art and architecture were widely copied and its antiquities were carried off to far corners of the world
its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia
a newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by europeans and egyptians has led to the scientific investigation of egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy
the nile has been the lifeline of its region for much of human history
the fertile floodplain of the nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization
nomadic modern human hunter gatherers began living in the nile valley through the end of the middle pleistocene some years ago
by the late paleolithic period the arid climate of northern africa had become increasingly hot and dry forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region
in predynastic and early dynastic times the egyptian climate was much less arid than it is today
large regions of egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates
foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the nile region supported large populations of waterfowl
hunting would have been common for egyptians and this is also the period when many animals were first domesticated
by about bc small tribes living in the nile valley had developed into a series of cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry and identifiable by their pottery and personal items such as combs bracelets and beads
the largest of these early cultures in upper egypt was the badarian culture which probably originated in the western desert it was known for its high quality ceramics stone tools and its use of copper
the badari was followed by the naqada culture the amratian the gerzeh and semainean
these brought a number of technological improvements
as early as the naqada i period predynastic egyptians imported obsidian from ethiopia used to shape blades and other objects from flakes
in naqada ii times early evidence exists of contact with the near east particularly canaan and the byblos coast
over a period of about years the naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the nile valley
establishing a power center at nekhen and later at abydos naqada iii leaders expanded their control of egypt northwards along the nile
they also traded with nubia to the south the oases of the western desert to the west and the cultures of the eastern mediterranean and near east to the east initiating a period of egypt mesopotamia relations
the naqada culture manufactured a diverse selection of material goods reflective of the increasing power and wealth of the elite as well as societal personal use items which included combs small statuary painted pottery high quality decorative stone vases cosmetic palettes and jewelry made of gold lapis and ivory
they also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience which was used well into the roman period to decorate cups amulets and figurines
during the last predynastic phase the naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient egyptian language
the early dynastic period was approximately contemporary to the early sumerian akkadian civilization of mesopotamia and of ancient elam
the third centurybc egyptian priest manetho grouped the long line of kings from menes to his own time into dynasties a system still used today
he began his official history with the king named meni who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of upper and lower egypt
the transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient egyptian writers represented and there is no contemporary record of menes
some scholars now believe however that the mythical menes may have been the king narmer who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial narmer palette in a symbolic act of unification
in the early dynastic period which began about bc the first of the dynastic kings solidified control over lower egypt by establishing a capital at memphis from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the levant
the increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at abydos which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death
the strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land labour and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient egyptian civilization
major advances in architecture art and technology were made during the old kingdom fueled by the increased agricultural productivity and resulting population made possible by a well developed central administration
some of ancient egypts crowning achievements the giza pyramids and great sphinx were constructed during the old kingdom
under the direction of the vizier state officials collected taxes coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield drafted peasants to work on construction projects and established a justice system to maintain peace and order
with the rising importance of central administration in egypt a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services
kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death
scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of egypt and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration
as the power of the kings diminished regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king
this coupled with severe droughts between and bc is believed to have caused the country to enter the year period of famine and strife known as the first intermediate period
after egypts central government collapsed at the end of the old kingdom the administration could no longer support or stabilize the countrys economy
regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small scale civil wars
yet despite difficult problems local leaders owing no tribute to the king used their new found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces
once in control of their own resources the provinces became economically richer which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes
in bursts of creativity provincial artisans adopted and adapted cultural motifs formerly restricted to the royalty of the old kingdom and scribes developed literary styles that expressed the optimism and originality of the period
free from their loyalties to the king local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
by bc rulers in herakleopolis controlled lower egypt in the north while a rival clan based in thebes the intef family took control of upper egypt in the south
as the intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable
around bc the northern theban forces under nebhepetre mentuhotep ii finally defeated the herakleopolitan rulers reuniting the two lands
they inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the middle kingdom
the kings of the middle kingdom restored the countrys stability and prosperity thereby stimulating a resurgence of art literature and monumental building projects
mentuhotep ii and his eleventh dynasty successors ruled from thebes but the vizier amenemhat i upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the twelfth dynasty around bc shifted the kingdoms capital to the city of itjtawy located in faiyum
from itjtawy the kings of the twelfth dynasty undertook a far sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region
moreover the military reconquered territory in nubia that was rich in quarries and gold mines while laborers built a defensive structure in the eastern delta called the walls of the ruler to defend against foreign attack
with the kings having secured the country militarily and politically and with vast agricultural and mineral wealth at their disposal the nations population arts and religion flourished
in contrast to elitist old kingdom attitudes towards the gods the middle kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety
middle kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident eloquent style
the relief and portrait sculpture of the period captured subtle individual details that reached new heights of technical sophistication
the last great ruler of the middle kingdom amenemhat iii allowed semitic speaking canaanite settlers from the near east into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns
these ambitious building and mining activities however combined with severe nile floods later in his reign strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the second intermediate period during the later thirteenth and fourteenth dynasties
during this decline the canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the delta region eventually coming to power in egypt as the hyksos
around bc as the power of the middle kingdom kings weakened a western asian people called the hyksos who had already settled in the delta seized control of egypt and established their capital at avaris forcing the former central government to retreat to thebes
the king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute
the hyksos retained egyptian models of government and identified as kings thereby integrating egyptian elements into their culture
they and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into egypt most notably the composite bow and the horse drawn chariot
after retreating south the native theban kings found themselves trapped between the canaanite hyksos ruling the north and the hyksos nubian allies the kushites to the south
after years of vassalage thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than years until bc
the kings seqenenre tao ii and kamose were ultimately able to defeat the nubians to the south of egypt but failed to defeat the hyksos
that task fell to kamoses successor ahmose i who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the hyksos presence in egypt
he established a new dynasty and in the new kingdom that followed the military became a central priority for the kings who sought to expand egypts borders and attempted to gain mastery of the near east
the new kingdom pharaohs established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours including the mitanni empire assyria and canaan
military campaigns waged under tuthmosis i and his grandson tuthmosis iii extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire egypt had ever seen
beginning with merneptah the rulers of egypt adopted the title of pharaoh
between their reigns hatshepsut a queen who established herself as pharaoh launched many building projects including the restoration of temples damaged by the hyksos and sent trading expeditions to punt and the sinai
when tuthmosis iii died in bc egypt had an empire extending from niya in north west syria to the fourth cataract of the nile in nubia cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood
the new kingdom pharaohs began a large scale building campaign to promote the god amun whose growing cult was based in karnak
they also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements both real and imagined
the karnak temple is the largest egyptian temple ever built
around bc the stability of the new kingdom was threatened when amenhotep iv ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms
changing his name to akhenaten he touted the previously obscure sun deity aten as the supreme deity suppressed the worship of most other deities and moved the capital to the new city of akhetaten
he was devoted to his new religion and artistic style
after his death the cult of the aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored
the subsequent pharaohs tutankhamun ay and horemheb worked to erase all mention of akhenatens heresy now known as the amarna period
around bc ramesses ii also known as ramesses the great ascended the throne and went on to build more temples erect more statues and obelisks and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history
a bold military leader ramesses ii led his army against the hittites in the battle of kadesh and after fighting to a stalemate finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty around bc
egypts wealth however made it a tempting target for invasion particularly by the libyan berbers to the west and the sea peoples a conjectured confederation of seafarers from the aegean sea
initially the military was able to repel these invasions but egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern canaan much of it falling to the assyrians
the effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption tomb robbery and civil unrest
after regaining their power the high priests at the temple of amun in thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth and their expanded power splintered the country during the third intermediate period
following the death of ramesses xi in bc smendes assumed authority over the northern part of egypt ruling from the city of tanis
the south was effectively controlled by the high priests of amun at thebes who recognized smendes in name only
during this time libyans had been settling in the western delta and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy
libyan princes took control of the delta under shoshenq i in bc founding the so called libyan or bubastite dynasty that would rule for some years
shoshenq also gained control of southern egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions
libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in leontopolis and kushites threatened from the south
around bc the kushite king piye invaded northward seizing control of thebes and eventually the delta which established the th dynasty
during the th dynasty pharaoh taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the new kingdoms
twenty fifth dynasty pharaohs built or restored temples and monuments throughout the nile valley including at memphis karnak kawa and jebel barkal
during this period the nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids since the middle kingdom
egypts far reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the third intermediate period
its foreign allies had fallen under the assyrian sphere of influence and by bc war between the two states became inevitable
between and bc the assyrians began the assyrian conquest of egypt
the reigns of both taharqa and his successor tanutamun were filled with constant conflict with the assyrians against whom egypt enjoyed several victories
ultimately the assyrians pushed the kushites back into nubia occupied memphis and sacked the temples of thebes
the assyrians left control of egypt to a series of vassals who became known as the saite kings of the twenty sixth dynasty
by bc the saite king psamtik i was able to oust the assyrians with the help of greek mercenaries who were recruited to form egypts first navy
greek influence expanded greatly as the city state of naucratis became the home of greeks in the nile delta
the saite kings based in the new capital of sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture but in bc the powerful persians led by cambyses ii began their conquest of egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh psamtik iii at the battle of pelusium
cambyses ii then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled egypt from iran leaving egypt under the control of a satrap
a few successful revolts against the persians marked the th centurybc but egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the persians
following its annexation by persia egypt was joined with cyprus and phoenicia in the sixth satrapy of the achaemenid persian empire
this first period of persian rule over egypt also known as the twenty seventh dynasty ended in bc when egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties
the last of these dynasties the thirtieth proved to be the last native royal house of ancient egypt ending with the kingship of nectanebo ii
a brief restoration of persian rule sometimes known as the thirty first dynasty began in bc but shortly after in bc the persian ruler mazaces handed egypt over to alexander the great without a fight
in bc alexander the great conquered egypt with little resistance from the persians and was welcomed by the egyptians as a deliverer
the administration established by alexanders successors the macedonian ptolemaic kingdom was based on an egyptian model and based in the new capital city of alexandria
the city showcased the power and prestige of hellenistic rule and became a seat of learning and culture centered at the famous library of alexandria
the lighthouse of alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city as the ptolemies made commerce and revenue generating enterprises such as papyrus manufacturing their top priority
hellenistic culture did not supplant native egyptian culture as the ptolemies supported time honored traditions in an effort to secure the loyalty of the populace
they built new temples in egyptian style supported traditional cults and portrayed themselves as pharaohs
some traditions merged as greek and egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities such as serapis and classical greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional egyptian motifs
despite their efforts to appease the egyptians the ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion bitter family rivalries and the powerful mob of alexandria that formed after the death of ptolemy iv
in addition as rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from egypt the romans took great interest in the political situation in the country
continued egyptian revolts ambitious politicians and powerful opponents from the near east made this situation unstable leading rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire
egypt became a province of the roman empire in bc following the defeat of mark antony and ptolemaic queen cleopatra vii by octavian in the battle of actium
the romans relied heavily on grain shipments from egypt and the roman army under the control of a prefect appointed by the emperor quelled rebellions strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes and prevented attacks by bandits which had become a notorious problem during the period
alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient as exotic luxuries were in high demand in rome
although the romans had a more hostile attitude than the greeks towards the egyptians some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued
the art of mummy portraiture flourished and some roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs though not to the extent that the ptolemies had
the former lived outside egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of egyptian kingship
local administration became roman in style and closed to native egyptians
from the mid first century ad christianity took root in egypt and it was originally seen as another cult that could be accepted
however it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from the pagan egyptian and greco roman religions and threatened popular religious traditions
this led to the persecution of converts to christianity culminating in the great purges of diocletian starting in but eventually christianity won out
in the christian emperor theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples
alexandria became the scene of great anti pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed
as a consequence egypts native religious culture was continually in decline
while the native population continued to speak their language the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished
the temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert
in the fourth century as the roman empire divided egypt found itself in the eastern empire with its capital at constantinople
in the waning years of the empire egypt fell to the sasanian persian army in the sasanian conquest of egypt
it was then recaptured by the byzantine emperor heraclius and was finally captured by muslim rashidun army in ending byzantine rule
the pharaoh was the absolute monarch of the country and at least in theory wielded complete control of the land and its resources
the king was the supreme military commander and head of the government who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs
in charge of the administration was his second in command the vizier who acted as the kings representative and coordinated land surveys the treasury building projects the legal system and the archives
at a regional level the country was divided into as many as administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction
the temples formed the backbone of the economy
not only were they places of worship but were also responsible for collecting and storing the kingdoms wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers who redistributed grain and goods
much of the economy was centrally organized and strictly controlled
although the ancient egyptians did not use coinage until the late period they did use a type of money barter system with standard sacks of grain and the deben a weight of roughly of copper or silver forming a common denominator
workers were paid in grain a simple laborer might earn sacks of grain per month while a foreman might earn sacks
prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading for example a shirt cost five copper deben while a cow cost deben
grain could be traded for other goods according to the fixed price list
during the fifth centurybc coined money was introduced into egypt from abroad
at first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage
egyptian society was highly stratified and social status was expressly displayed
farmers made up the bulk of the population but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state temple or noble family that owned the land
farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corve system
artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers but they were also under state control working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury
scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient egypt known as the white kilt class in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank
the upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature
below the nobility were the priests physicians and engineers with specialized training in their field
it is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient egypt there is difference of opinions among authors
the ancient egyptians viewed men and women including people from all social classes as essentially equal under the law and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress
although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants they were able to buy and sell their servitude work their way to freedom or nobility and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace
both men and women had the right to own and sell property make contracts marry and divorce receive inheritance and pursue legal disputes in court
married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end
compared with their counterparts in ancient greece rome and even more modern places around the world ancient egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices legal rights and opportunities for achievement
women such as hatshepsut and cleopatra vii even became pharaohs while others wielded power as divine wives of amun
despite these freedoms ancient egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration aside from the royal high priestesses apparently served only secondary roles in the temples and were not so likely to be as educated as men
the head of the legal system was officially the pharaoh who was responsible for enacting laws delivering justice and maintaining law and order a concept the ancient egyptians referred to as maat
although no legal codes from ancient egypt survive court documents show that egyptian law was based on a common sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes
local councils of elders known as kenbet in the new kingdom were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes
more serious cases involving murder major land transactions and tomb robbery were referred to the great kenbet over which the vizier or pharaoh presided
plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth
in some cases the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co conspirators
whether the charges were trivial or serious court scribes documented the complaint testimony and verdict of the case for future reference
punishment for minor crimes involved either imposition of fines beatings facial mutilation or exile depending on the severity of the offense
serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution carried out by decapitation drowning or impaling the criminal on a stake
punishment could also be extended to the criminals family
beginning in the new kingdom oracles played a major role in the legal system dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases
the procedure was to ask the god a yes or no question concerning the right or wrong of an issue
the god carried by a number of priests rendered judgement by choosing one or the other moving forward or backward or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon
a combination of favorable geographical features contributed to the success of ancient egyptian culture the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the nile river
the ancient egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural technological and artistic pursuits
land management was crucial in ancient egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned
farming in egypt was dependent on the cycle of the nile river
the egyptians recognized three seasons akhet peret and shemu
the flooding season lasted from june to september depositing on the rivers banks a layer of mineral rich silt ideal for growing crops
after the floodwaters had receded the growing season lasted from october to february
farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields which were irrigated with ditches and canals
egypt received little rainfall so farmers relied on the nile to water their crops
from march to may farmers used sickles to harvest their crops which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain
winnowing removed the chaff from the grain and the grain was then ground into flour brewed to make beer or stored for later use
the ancient egyptians cultivated emmer and barley and several other cereal grains all of which were used to make the two main food staples of bread and beer
flax plants uprooted before they started flowering were grown for the fibers of their stems
these fibers were split along their length and spun into thread which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing
papyrus growing on the banks of the nile river was used to make paper
vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots close to habitations and on higher ground and had to be watered by hand
vegetables included leeks garlic melons squashes pulses lettuce and other crops in addition to grapes that were made into wine
the egyptians believed that a balanced relationship between people and animals was an essential element of the cosmic order thus humans animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole
animals both domesticated and wild were therefore a critical source of spirituality companionship and sustenance to the ancient egyptians
cattle were the most important livestock the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them
in addition to cattle the ancient egyptians kept sheep goats and pigs
poultry such as ducks geese and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms where they were force fed with dough to fatten them
the nile provided a plentiful source of fish
bees were also domesticated from at least the old kingdom and provided both honey and wax
the ancient egyptians used donkeys and oxen as beasts of burden and they were responsible for plowing the fields and trampling seed into the soil
the slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual
horses were introduced by the hyksos in the second intermediate period
camels although known from the new kingdom were not used as beasts of burden until the late period
there is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly used in the late period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land
cats dogs and monkeys were common family pets while more exotic pets imported from the heart of africa such as sub saharan african lions were reserved for royalty
herodotus observed that the egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses
during the late period the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular such as the cat goddess bastet and the ibis god thoth and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice
egypt is rich in building and decorative stone copper and lead ores gold and semiprecious stones
these natural resources allowed the ancient egyptians to build monuments sculpt statues make tools and fashion jewelry
embalmers used salts from the wadi natrun for mummification which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster
ore bearing rock formations were found in distant inhospitable wadis in the eastern desert and the sinai requiring large state controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there
there were extensive gold mines in nubia and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region
the wadi hammamat was a notable source of granite greywacke and gold
flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the nile valley
nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose
ancient egyptians were among the first to use minerals such as sulfur as cosmetic substances
the egyptians worked deposits of the lead ore galena at gebel rosas to make net sinkers plumb bobs and small figurines
copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the sinai
workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits or by the more labor intensive process of grinding and washing gold bearing quartzite
iron deposits found in upper egypt were used in the late period
high quality building stones were abundant in egypt the ancient egyptians quarried limestone all along the nile valley granite from aswan and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the eastern desert
deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry greywacke alabaster and carnelian dotted the eastern desert and were collected even before the first dynasty
in the ptolemaic and roman periods miners worked deposits of emeralds in wadi sikait and amethyst in wadi el hudi
the ancient egyptians engaged in trade with their foreign neighbors to obtain rare exotic goods not found in egypt
in the predynastic period they established trade with nubia to obtain gold and incense
they also established trade with palestine as evidenced by palestinian style oil jugs found in the burials of the first dynasty pharaohs
an egyptian colony stationed in southern canaan dates to slightly before the first dynasty
narmer had egyptian pottery produced in canaan and exported back to egypt
by the second dynasty at latest ancient egyptian trade with byblos yielded a critical source of quality timber not found in egypt
by the fifth dynasty trade with punt provided gold aromatic resins ebony ivory and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons
egypt relied on trade with anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze
the ancient egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli which had to be imported from far away afghanistan
egypts mediterranean trade partners also included greece and crete which provided among other goods supplies of olive oil
the egyptian language is a northern afro asiatic language closely related to the berber and semitic languages
it has the longest known history of any language having been written from c
bc to the middle ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer
the phases of ancient egyptian are old egyptian middle egyptian late egyptian demotic and coptic
egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before coptic but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around memphis and later thebes
ancient egyptian was a synthetic language but it became more analytic later on
late egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles which replaced the older inflectional suffixes
there was a change from the older verb subject object word order to subject verb object
the egyptian hieroglyphic hieratic and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic coptic alphabet
coptic is still used in the liturgy of the egyptian orthodox church and traces of it are found in modern egyptian arabic
ancient egyptian has consonants similar to those of other afro asiatic languages
these include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants voiced and voiceless stops voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates
it has three long and three short vowels which expanded in late egyptian to about nine
the basic word in egyptian similar to semitic and berber is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants
suffixes are added to form words
the verb conjugation corresponds to the person
for example the triconsonantal skeleton is the semantic core of the word hear its basic conjugation is he hears
if the subject is a noun suffixes are not added to the verb the woman hears
adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with arabic
the word order is in verbal and adjectival sentences and in nominal and adverbial sentences
the subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun
verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences
stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable which can be open or closed
hieroglyphic writing dates from c
bc and is composed of hundreds of symbols
a hieroglyph can represent a word a sound or a silent determinative and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts
hieroglyphs were a formal script used on stone monuments and in tombs that could be as detailed as individual works of art
in day to day writing scribes used a cursive form of writing called hieratic which was quicker and easier
while formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction hieratic was always written from right to left usually in horizontal rows
a new form of writing demotic became the prevalent writing style and it is this form of writing along with formal hieroglyphs that accompany the greek text on the rosetta stone
around the first century ad the coptic alphabet started to be used alongside the demotic script
coptic is a modified greek alphabet with the addition of some demotic signs
although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them
as the traditional religious establishments were disbanded knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost
attempts to decipher them date to the byzantine and islamic periods in egypt but only in the s after the discovery of the rosetta stone and years of research by thomas young and jean franois champollion were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered
writing first appeared in association with kingship on labels and tags for items found in royal tombs
it was primarily an occupation of the scribes who worked out of the per ankh institution or the house of life
the latter comprised offices libraries laboratories and observatories
some of the best known pieces of ancient egyptian literature such as the pyramid and coffin texts were written in classical egyptian which continued to be the language of writing until about bc
late egyptian was spoken from the new kingdom onward and is represented in ramesside administrative documents love poetry and tales as well as in demotic and coptic texts
during this period the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography such as those of harkhuf and weni
the genre known as sebayt was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles the ipuwer papyrus a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval is a famous example
the story of sinuhe written in middle egyptian might be the classic of egyptian literature
also written at this time was the westcar papyrus a set of stories told to khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests
the instruction of amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near eastern literature
towards the end of the new kingdom the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the story of wenamun and the instruction of any
the former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from lebanon and of his struggle to return to egypt
from about bc narrative stories and instructions such as the popular instructions of onchsheshonqy as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of egyptian
many stories written in demotic during the greco roman period were set in previous historical eras when egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as ramesses ii
most ancient egyptians were farmers tied to the land
their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day
each home had a kitchen with an open roof which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread
ceramics served as household wares for the storage preparation transport and consumption of food drink and raw materials
walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings
floors were covered with reed mats while wooden stools beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture
the ancient egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance
most bathed in the nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk
men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin
clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs jewelry and cosmetics
children went without clothing until maturity at about age and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved
mothers were responsible for taking care of the children while the father provided the familys income
music and dance were popular entertainments for those who could afford them
early instruments included flutes and harps while instruments similar to trumpets oboes and pipes developed later and became popular
in the new kingdom the egyptians played on bells cymbals tambourines drums and imported lutes and lyres from asia
the sistrum was a rattle like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies
the ancient egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities including games and music
senet a board game where pieces moved according to random chance was particularly popular from the earliest times another similar game was mehen which had a circular gaming board
hounds and jackals also known as holes is another example of board games played in ancient egypt
the first complete set of this game was discovered from a theban tomb of the egyptian pharaoh amenemhat iv that dates to the th dynasty
juggling and ball games were popular with children and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at beni hasan
the wealthy members of ancient egyptian society enjoyed hunting fishing and boating as well
the excavation of the workers village of deir el medina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world which spans almost four hundred years
there is no comparable site in which the organization social interactions and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail
egyptian cuisine remained remarkably stable over time indeed the cuisine of modern egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients
the staple diet consisted of bread and beer supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic and fruit such as dates and figs
wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis
fish meat and fowl could be salted or dried and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill
the architecture of ancient egypt includes some of the most famous structures in the world the great pyramids of giza and the temples at thebes
building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes but also to reinforce the wide ranging power of the pharaoh
the ancient egyptians were skilled builders using only simple but effective tools and sighting instruments architects could build large stone structures with great accuracy and precision that is still envied today
the domestic dwellings of elite and ordinary egyptians alike were constructed from perishable materials such as mudbricks and wood and have not survived
peasants lived in simple homes while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures
a few surviving new kingdom palaces such as those in malkata and amarna show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people birds water pools deities and geometric designs
important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks
the architectural elements used in the worlds first large scale stone building djosers mortuary complex include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif
the earliest preserved ancient egyptian temples such as those at giza consist of single enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns
in the new kingdom architects added the pylon the open courtyard and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temples sanctuary a style that was standard until the greco roman period
the earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the old kingdom was the mastaba a flat roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber
the step pyramid of djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other
pyramids were built during the old and middle kingdoms but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock cut tombs
the use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the new kingdom and in the royal pyramids of nubia
the ancient egyptians produced art to serve functional purposes
for over years artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the old kingdom following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change
these artistic standards simple lines shapes and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth created a sense of order and balance within a composition
images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls coffins stelae and even statues
the narmer palette for example displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs
because of the rigid rules that governed its highly stylized and symbolic appearance ancient egyptian art served its political and religious purposes with precision and clarity
ancient egyptian artisans used stone as a medium for carving statues and fine reliefs but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute
paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores copper ores soot or charcoal and limestone
paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes which could be moistened with water when needed
pharaohs used reliefs to record victories in battle royal decrees and religious scenes
common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art such as shabti statues and books of the dead which they believed would protect them in the afterlife
during the middle kingdom wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb
in an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife these models show laborers houses boats and even military formations that are scale representations of the ideal ancient egyptian afterlife
despite the homogeneity of ancient egyptian art the styles of particular times and places sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes
after the invasion of the hyksos in the second intermediate period minoan style frescoes were found in avaris
the most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the amarna period where figures were radically altered to conform to akhenatens revolutionary religious ideas
this style known as amarna art was quickly abandoned after akhenatens death and replaced by the traditional forms
beliefs in the divine and in the afterlife were ingrained in ancient egyptian civilization from its inception pharaonic rule was based on the divine right of kings
the egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection
however the gods were not always viewed as benevolent and egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers
the structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system
these various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality
gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the kings behalf
at the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine
temples were not places of public worship or congregation and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship
normally the gods domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials
common citizens could worship private statues in their homes and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos
after the new kingdom the pharaohs role as a spiritual intermediary was de emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods
as a result priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people
the egyptians believed that every human being was composed of physical and spiritual parts or aspects
in addition to the body each person had a wt a ba a ka and a name
the heart rather than the brain was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions
after death the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will but they required the physical remains as a permanent home
the ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the blessed dead living on as an akh or effective one
for this to happen the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial in which the heart was weighed against a feather of truth
if deemed worthy the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form
if they were not deemed worthy their heart was eaten by ammit the devourer and they were erased from the universe
the ancient egyptians maintained an elaborate set of burial customs that they believed were necessary to ensure immortality after death
these customs involved preserving the body by mummification performing burial ceremonies and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife
before the old kingdom bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation
the arid desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient egypt for burials of the poor who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite
wealthier egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification which involved removing the internal organs wrapping the body in linen and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin
beginning in the fourth dynasty some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars
by the new kingdom the ancient egyptians had perfected the art of mummification the best technique took days and involved removing the internal organs removing the brain through the nose and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron
the body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin
mummies of the late period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases
actual preservation practices declined during the ptolemaic and roman eras while greater emphasis was placed on the outer appearance of the mummy which was decorated
wealthy egyptians were buried with larger quantities of luxury items but all burials regardless of social status included goods for the deceased
funerary texts were often included in the grave and beginning in the new kingdom so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife
rituals in which the deceased was magically re animated accompanied burials
after burial living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased
the ancient egyptian military was responsible for defending egypt against foreign invasion and for maintaining egypts domination in the ancient near east
the military protected mining expeditions to the sinai during the old kingdom and fought civil wars during the first and second intermediate periods
the military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes such as those found at the city of buhen on the way to nubia
forts also were constructed to serve as military bases such as the fortress at sile which was a base of operations for expeditions to the levant
in the new kingdom a series of pharaohs used the standing egyptian army to attack and conquer kush and parts of the levant
typical military equipment included bows and arrows spears and round topped shields made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame
in the new kingdom the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the hyksos invaders
weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle spears were tipped with a bronze point and the khopesh was adopted from asiatic soldiers
the pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs such as seqenenre tao ii and his sons did do so
however it has also been argued that kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders fighting alongside their troops
soldiers were recruited from the general population but during and especially after the new kingdom mercenaries from nubia kush and libya were hired to fight for egypt
in technology medicine and mathematics ancient egypt achieved a relatively high standard of productivity and sophistication
traditional empiricism as evidenced by the edwin smith and ebers papyri is first credited to egypt
the egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system
even before the old kingdom the ancient egyptians had developed a glassy material known as faience which they treated as a type of artificial semi precious stone
faience is a non clay ceramic made of silica small amounts of lime and soda and a colorant typically copper
the material was used to make beads tiles figurines and small wares
several methods can be used to create faience but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core which was then fired
by a related technique the ancient egyptians produced a pigment known as egyptian blue also called blue frit which is produced by fusing silica copper lime and an alkali such as natron
the product can be ground up and used as a pigment
the ancient egyptians could fabricate a wide variety of objects from glass with great skill but it is not clear whether they developed the process independently
it is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre made ingots which they melted and finished
however they did have technical expertise in making objects as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass
a range of colors could be produced including yellow red green blue purple and white and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque
the medical problems of the ancient egyptians stemmed directly from their environment
living and working close to the nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites which caused liver and intestinal damage
dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat
the lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body
the grit and sand from stone ground flour abraded teeth leaving them susceptible to abscesses
the diets of the wealthy were rich in sugars which promoted periodontal disease
despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence
adult life expectancy was about for men and for women but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one third of the population died in infancy
ancient egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient near east for their healing skills and some such as imhotep remained famous long after their deaths
herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among egyptian physicians with some treating only the head or the stomach while others were eye doctors and dentists
training of physicians took place at the per ankh or house of life institution most notably those headquartered in per bastet during the new kingdom and at abydos and sas in the late period
medical papyri show empirical knowledge of anatomy injuries and practical treatments
wounds were treated by bandaging with raw meat white linen sutures nets pads and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection while opium thyme and belladona were used to relieve pain
the earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies
prayers were made to the goddess isis
moldy bread honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns
garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms
ancient egyptian surgeons stitched wounds set broken bones and amputated diseased limbs but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred
early egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull and had mastered advanced forms of shipbuilding as early as bc
the archaeological institute of america reports that the oldest planked ships known are the abydos boats
a group of discovered ships in abydos were constructed of wooden planks sewn together
discovered by egyptologist david oconnor of new york university woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams
because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to pharaoh khasekhemwy originally they were all thought to have belonged to him but one of the ships dates to bc and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating
the ship dating to bc was long and is now thought to perhaps have belonged to an earlier pharaoh perhaps one as early as hor aha
early egyptians also knew how to assemble planks of wood with treenails to fasten them together using pitch for caulking the seams
the khufu ship a vessel sealed into a pit in the giza pyramid complex at the foot of the great pyramid of giza in the fourth dynasty around bc is a full size surviving example that may have filled the symbolic function of a solar barque
early egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints
in an ancient north south canal was discovered extending from lake timsah to the ballah lakes
it was dated to the middle kingdom of egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course
in archaeologists from italy the united states and egypt excavating a dried up lagoon known as mersa gawasis have unearthed traces of an ancient harbor that once launched early voyages like hatshepsuts punt expedition onto the open ocean
some of the sites most evocative evidence for the ancient egyptians seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes made from papyrus coiled in huge bundles
in a team of franco egyptian archaeologists discovered what is believed to be the worlds oldest port dating back about years from the time of king cheops on the red sea coast near wadi el jarf
the earliest attested examples of mathematical calculations date to the predynastic naqada period and show a fully developed numeral system
the importance of mathematics to an educated egyptian is suggested by a new kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land labor and grain
texts such as the rhind mathematical papyrus and the moscow mathematical papyrus show that the ancient egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations addition subtraction multiplication and division use fractions calculate the areas of rectangles triangles and circles and compute the volumes of boxes columns and pyramids
they understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations
mathematical notation was decimal and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million
each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number so to write the number eighty or eight hundred the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively
because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions
for example they resolved the fraction two fifths into the sum of one third one fifteenth
standard tables of values facilitated this
some common fractions however were written with a special glyph the equivalent of the modern two thirds is shown on the right
ancient egyptian mathematicians knew the pythagorean theorem as an empirical formula
they were aware for example that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a ratio
they were able to estimate the area of a circle by subtracting one ninth from its diameter and squaring the result a reasonable approximation of the formula
the golden ratio seems to be reflected in many egyptian constructions including the pyramids but its use may have been an unintended consequence of the ancient egyptian practice of combining the use of knotted ropes with an intuitive sense of proportion and harmony
estimates of the size of the population range from million in the rd millennium bc to possibly million by the st millennium bc before growing significantly towards the end of that millennium
in the dna of the th dynasty mummies of ramesses iii and another mummy believed to be ramesses iiis son pentawer were analyzed by albert zink yehia z gad and a team of researchers under zahi hawass then secretary general of the supreme council of antiquities egypt
genetic kinship analyses revealed identical haplotypes in both mummies
using the whit atheys haplogroup predictor they identified the y chromosomal haplogroup eba
in a team led by researchers from the university of tuebingen and the max planck institute for the science of human history in jena tested the maternal dna of mummies from abusir el meleq in northern egypt which was the first reliable data using high throughput dna sequencing methods
additionally three of the mummies were also analyzed for y dna
two were assigned to west asian j and one to haplogroup ebb both common in north africa
the researchers cautioned that the affinities of the examined ancient egyptian specimens may not be representative of those of all ancient egyptians since they were from a single archaeological site
whilst not conclusive since the few relatively older mummies only go back to the th th dynasty the rest being from then up to late roman period the authors of this study said the abusir el meleq mummies closely resembled ancient and modern near eastern populations especially those in the levant
the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent within this range even as different powers including nubians greeks and romans conquered the empire
a wide range of mtdna haplogroups were found including clades of j u h hv m r r k t l i n x w
the authors of the study noted that the mummies at abusir el meleq have maternal sub saharan dna while modern egyptians have a little more sub saharan ancestry to suggesting some degree of influx after the end of the empire
other genetic studies show greater levels of sub saharan african ancestry in modern southern egyptian populations and anticipate that mummies from southern egypt would show greater levels of sub saharan african ancestry
gourdine anselin and keita criticised the methodology of the scheunemann et al study and argued that the sub saharan genetic affinities may be attributed to early settlers and the relevant sub saharan genetic markers do not correspond with the geography of known trade routes
in danielle candelora noted several limitations with the scheunemann et al
study such as its untested sampling methods small sample size and problematic comparative data which she argued had been misused to legitimise racist conceptions of ancient egypt with scientific evidence
in christopher ehret criticised the conclusions of the study which proposed the ancient egyptians had a levantine background based on insufficient sampling and a biased interpretation of the genetic data
ehret argued this was reminiscent of earlier scholarship and also conflicted with existing archaeological linguistic and biological anthropological evidence which determined the founding locales of ancient egypt to be the descendants of longtime populations in northeastern africa such as nubia and the northern horn of africa
ehret also criticised the study for asserting that there was no sub saharan component in the egyptian population
ehret cited other genetic evidence which had identified the horn of africa as a source of a genetic marker m y chromosome lineage for a significant population component which moved north from that region into egypt and the levant
because the study only sampled from a single site at abusir el meleq scheunemann et al
carried out a follow up study by collecting samples from six different excavation sites along the entire length of the nile valley spanning years of egyptian history
samples were collected from mummies and skeletal remains and high quality mitochondrial genomes were reconstructed from individuals
the authors argued that the analyzed mitochondrial genomes supported the results from the earlier study at abusir el meleq
in the year old mummified head of djehutynakht a governor in the middle kingdom of the th or th dynasty was analyzed for mitochondrial dna
the sequence of the mummy most closely resembles a ua lineage from sample jk a much more recent year old skeleton from the abusir el meleq site in egypt although no direct matches to the djehutynakht sequence have been reported
in the mummified remains of two high status egyptian relatives nakht ankh and khnum nakht were analyzed dna by a team of researchers from the university of manchester
the results found differences in the y chromosome snps of the two mummies which indicated different paternal lineages and concluded that nakht ankh and khnum nakht were half brothers but y chromosome sequences were not complete enough to determine paternal haplogroup
the snp identities were consistent with mtdna haplogroup ma with degree of confidence thus confirming the african origins of the two individuals
a dna study by gad hawass et al
analysed mitochondrial and y chromosomal haplogroups from tutankhamuns family members of the th dynasty using comprehensive control procedures to ensure quality results
they found that the y chromosome haplogroup of the family was rb which originated in europe and which today makes up of the genetic pool of modern western europeans
the mitochondrial haplogroup was k which is most likely also part of a near eastern lineage
the profiles for tutankhamun and amenhotep iii were incomplete and the analysis produced differing probability figures despite having concordant allele results
because the relationships of these two mummies with the kv mummy had previously been confirmed in an earlier study the haplogroup prediction of both mummies could be derived from the full profile of the kv data
the th dynasty pair of ramesses iii and his son were found to have the haplogroup eba which has its highest frequencies in modern populations from west africa and central africa but which is rare among north africans and nearly absent in east africa
the specific clade of rb was not determined
in hawass et al
undertook detailed anthropological radiological and genetic studies as part of the king tutankhamun family project
the objectives included attempting to determine familial relationships among royal mummies of the new kingdom as well to research for pathological features including potential inherited disorders and infectious diseases
in hawass et al
undertook an anthropological forensic radiological and genetic study of the th dynasty mummies of ramesses iii and an unknown man which were found together
in soy keita analysed short tandem loci data published as part of these studies by hawass et al
using an algorithm that only has three choices eurasians sub saharan africans and east asians
using these three options keita concluded that the majority of the samples which included tutankhamun and rameses iii had a population affinity with sub saharan africans in one affinity analysis
however keita cautioned that this does not mean that the royal mummies lacked other affiliations which he argued had been obscured in typological thinking
keita further added that different data and algorithms might give different results which reflects the complexity of biological heritage and the associated interpretation
the culture and monuments of ancient egypt have left a lasting legacy on the world
egyptian civilization significantly influenced the kingdom of kush and mero with both adopting egyptian religious and architectural norms were built in egypt sudan as well as using egyptian writing as the basis of the meroitic script
meroitic is the oldest written language in africa other than egyptian and was used from the nd century bc until the early th century ad
the cult of the goddess isis for example became popular in the roman empire as obelisks and other relics were transported back to rome
the romans also imported building materials from egypt to erect egyptian style structures
early historians such as herodotus strabo and diodorus siculus studied and wrote about the land which romans came to view as a place of mystery
during the middle ages and the renaissance egyptian pagan culture was in decline after the rise of christianity and later islam but interest in egyptian antiquity continued in the writings of medieval scholars such as dhul nun al misri and al maqrizi
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries european travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys leading to a wave of egyptomania across europe as evident in symbolism like the eye of providence and the great seal of the united states
this renewed interest sent collectors to egypt who took purchased or were given many important antiquities
napoleon arranged the first studies in egyptology when he brought some scientists and artists to study and document egypts natural history which was published in the description de lgypte
in the th century the egyptian government and archaeologists alike recognized the importance of cultural respect and integrity in excavations
since the s the ministry of tourism and antiquities has overseen excavations and the recovery of artifacts

motor neuron diseases or motor neurone diseases are a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that selectively affect motor neurons the cells which control voluntary muscles of the body
they include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progressive bulbar palsy pseudobulbar palsy progressive muscular atrophy primary lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy and monomelic amyotrophy as well as some rarer variants resembling als
motor neuron diseases affect both children and adults
while each motor neuron disease affects patients differently they all cause movement related symptoms mainly muscle weakness
most of these diseases seem to occur randomly without known causes but some forms are inherited
studies into these inherited forms have led to discoveries of various genes that are thought to be important in understanding how the disease occurs
symptoms of motor neuron diseases can be first seen at birth or can come on slowly later in life
most of these diseases worsen over time while some such as als shorten ones life expectancy others do not
currently there are no approved treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders and care is mostly symptomatic
signs and symptoms depend on the specific disease but motor neuron diseases typically manifest as a group of movement related symptoms
they come on slowly and worsen over the course of more than three months
various patterns of muscle weakness are seen and muscle cramps and spasms may occur
one can have difficulty breathing with climbing stairs difficulty breathing when lying down or even respiratory failure if breathing muscles become involved
bulbar symptoms including difficulty speaking difficulty swallowing and excessive saliva production can also occur
sensation or the ability to feel is typically not affected
emotional disturbance and cognitive and behavioural changes are also seen
there can be lower motor neuron findings upper motor neuron findings or both
motor neuron diseases are seen both in children and adults
those that affect children tend to be inherited or familial and their symptoms are either present at birth or appear before learning to walk
those that affect adults tend to appear after age
the clinical course depends on the specific disease but most progress or worsen over the course of months
some are fatal while others are not
various patterns of muscle weakness occur in different motor neuron diseases
weakness can be symmetric or asymmetric and it can occur in body parts that are distal proximal or both
according to statland et al
there are three main weakness patterns that are seen in motor neuron diseases which are motor neuron diseases are on a spectrum in terms of upper and lower motor neuron involvement
some have just lower or upper motor neuron findings while others have a mix of both
lower motor neuron findings include muscle atrophy and fasciculations and upper motor neuron findings include hyperreflexia spasticity muscle spasm and abnormal reflexes
pure upper motor neuron diseases or those with just umn findings include pls
pure lower motor neuron diseases or those with just lmn findings include pma
motor neuron diseases with both umn and lmn findings include both familial and sporadic als
most cases are sporadic and their causes are usually not known
it is thought that environmental toxic viral or genetic factors may be involved
tardbp also referred to as tdp is a critical component of the non homologous end joining enzymatic pathway that repairs dna double strand breaks in pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons
tdp is rapidly recruited to double strand breaks where it acts as a scaffold for the recruitment of the xrcc dna ligase protein complex that then acts to repair double strand breaks
about of als patients have abnormalities in the nucleus cytoplasmic localization in spinal motor neurons of tdp
in tdp depleted human neural stem cell derived motor neurons as well as in sporadic als patients spinal cord specimens there is significant double strand break accumulation and reduced levels of nhej
in adults men are more commonly affected than women
differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the number of overlapping symptoms shared between several motor neuron diseases
frequently the diagnosis is based on clinical findings family history of mnd and a variation of tests many of which are used to rule out disease mimics which can manifest with identical symptoms
motor neuron disease describes a collection of clinical disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the degeneration of the motor neuron on electrophysiological testing
the term motor neuron disease has varying meanings in different countries
similarly the literature inconsistently classifies which degenerative motor neuron disorders can be included under the umbrella term motor neuron disease
the four main types of mnd are marked in the table below
sporadic or acquired mnds occur in patients with no family history of degenerative motor neuron disease
inherited or genetic mnds adhere to one of the following inheritance patterns autosomal dominant autosomal recessive or x linked
some disorders like als can occur sporadically or can have a genetic cause with the same clinical symptoms and progression of disease
umns are motor neurons that project from the cortex down to the brainstem or spinal cord
lmns originate in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and synapse on peripheral muscles
both motor neurons are necessary for the strong contraction of a muscle but damage to an umn can be distinguished from damage to a lmn by physical exam
there are no known curative treatments for the majority of motor neuron disorders
please refer to the articles on individual disorders for more details
the table below lists life expectancy for patients who are diagnosed with mnd
in the united states and canada the term motor neuron disease usually refers to the group of disorders while amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is frequently called lou gehrigs disease
in the united kingdom and australia the term motor neuron disease is used for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis although is not uncommon to refer to the entire group
while mnd refers to a specific subset of similar diseases there are numerous other diseases of motor neurons that are referred to collectively as motor neuron disorders for instance the diseases belonging to the spinal muscular atrophies group
however they are not classified as motor neuron diseases by the th edition of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems which is the definition followed in this article
an abjad is a writing system in which only consonants are represented leaving vowel sounds to be inferred by the reader
this contrasts with alphabets which provide graphemes for both consonants and vowels
the term was introduced in by peter t
other terms for the same concept include partial phonemic script segmentally linear defective phonographic script consonantary consonant writing and consonantal alphabet
impure abjads represent vowels with either optional diacritics a limited number of distinct vowel glyphs or both
the name abjad is based on the arabic alphabets first four letters corresponding to a b j and d to replace the more common terms consonantary and consonantal alphabet in describing the family of scripts classified as west semitic
similar to other semitic languages such as phoenician hebrew and semitic proto alphabets specifically aleph bet gimel dalet
according to the formulations of peter t
daniels abjads differ from alphabets in that only consonants not vowels are represented among the basic graphemes
abjads differ from abugidas another category defined by daniels in that in abjads the vowel sound is implied by phonology and where vowel marks exist for the system such as nikkud for hebrew and arakt for arabic their use is optional and not the dominant form
abugidas mark all vowels with a diacritic a minor attachment to the letter a standalone glyph or by rotation of the letter
some abugidas use a special symbol to suppress the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented
in a syllabary a grapheme denotes a complete syllable that is either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds
the contrast of abjad versus alphabet has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term for the arabic numeral system
also it may be taken as suggesting that consonantal alphabets in contrast to eg the greek alphabet were not yet true alphabets
florian coulmas a critic of daniels and of the abjad terminology argues that this terminology can confuse alphabets with transcription systems and that there is no reason to relegate the hebrew aramaic or phoenician alphabets to second class status as an incomplete alphabet
however danielss terminology has found acceptance in the linguistic community
the first abjad to gain widespread usage was the phoenician abjad
unlike other contemporary scripts such as cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphs the phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols
this made the script easy to learn and seafaring phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then known world
the phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically much as manygana was used to represent japanese phonetically before the invention of kana
phoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems including the widely used aramaic abjad and the greek alphabet
the greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets such as latin and cyrillic while aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of asia
impure abjads have characters for some vowels optional vowel diacritics or both
the term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators
however most modern abjads such as arabic hebrew aramaic and pahlavi are impure abjadsthat is they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes although the said non diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants particularly approximants that sound similar to long vowels
a pure abjad is exemplified by very early forms of ancient phoenician though at some point it and most of the contemporary semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers called matres lectionis
this practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times
in the th century bc the greeks adapted the phoenician script for use in their own language
the phonetic structure of the greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented so the script was modified
they did not need letters for the guttural sounds represented by aleph he heth or ayin so these symbols were assigned vocalic values
the letters waw and yod were also adapted into vowel signs along with he these were already used as matres lectionis in phoenician
the major innovation of greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants
abugidas developed along a slightly different route
the basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent a vowel sound
hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel
in this way the south arabian abjad evolved into the geez abugida of ethiopia between the th century bc and the th century ad
similarly the brhm abugida of the indian subcontinent developed around the rd century bc
the other major family of abugidas canadian aboriginal syllabics was initially developed in the s by missionary and linguist james evans for the cree and ojibwe languages
evans used features of devanagari script and pitman shorthand to create his initial abugida
later in the th century other missionaries adapted evanss system to other canadian aboriginal languages
canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol with each vowel having a consistent orientation
the abjad form of writing is well adapted to the morphological structure of the semitic languages it was developed to write
this is because words in semitic languages are formed from a root consisting of three consonants the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms
for instance according to classical arabic and modern standard arabic from the arabic root dh b can be derived the forms slaughtered and
in most cases the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots and improving word recognition while reading for practiced readers
by contrast the arabic and hebrew scripts sometimes perform the role of true alphabets rather than abjads when used to write certain indo european languages including kurdish bosnian yiddish and some romance languages such as mozarabic aragonese portuguese spanish and ladino
an abugida sometimes known as alphasyllabary neosyllabary or pseudo alphabet is a segmental writing system in which consonant vowel sequences are written as units each unit is based on a consonant letter and vowel notation is secondary
this contrasts with a full alphabet in which vowels have status equal to consonants and with an abjad in which vowel marking is absent partial or optional in less formal contexts all three types of script may be termed alphabets
the terms also contrast them with a syllabary in which the symbols cannot be split into separate consonants and vowels
related concepts were introduced independently in by james germain fvrier and david diringer then in by fred householder
the ethiopic term abugida was chosen as a designation for the concept in by peter t
in faber suggested segmentally coded syllabically linear phonographic script and in bright used the term alphasyllabary and gnanadesikan and rimzhim katz fowler have suggested aksara or ksharik
abugidas include the extensive brahmic family of scripts of tibet south and southeast asia semitic ethiopic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics
as is the case for syllabaries the units of the writing system may consist of the representations both of syllables and of consonants
for scripts of the brahmic family the term akshara is used for the units
in several languages of ethiopia and eritrea abugida traditionally meant letters of the ethiopic or geez script in which many of these languages are written
geez is one of several segmental writing systems in the world others include indic brahmic scripts and canadian aboriginal syllabics
the word abugida is derived from the four letters bu gi and da in much the same way that abecedary is derived from latin letters a be ce de abjad is derived from the arabic a b j d and alphabet is derived from the names of the two first letters in the greek alphabet alpha and beta
abugida as a term in linguistics was proposed by peter t
daniels in his typology of writing systems
as daniels used the word an abugida is in contrast with a syllabary where letters with shared consonant or vowel sounds show no particular resemblance to one another
furthermore an abugida is also in contrast with an alphabet proper where independent letters are used to denote both consonants and vowels
the term alphasyllabary was suggested for the indic scripts in by william bright following south asian linguistic usage to convey the idea that they share features of both alphabet and syllabary
the formal definitions given by daniels and bright for abugida and alphasyllabary differ some writing systems are abugidas but not alphasyllabaries and some are alphasyllabaries but not abugidas
an abugida is defined as a type of writing system whose basic characters denote consonants followed by a particular vowel and in which diacritics denote other vowels
an alphasyllabary is defined as a type of writing system in which the vowels are denoted by subsidiary symbols not all of which occur in a linear order that is congruent with their temporal order in speech
bright did not require that an alphabet explicitly represent all vowels
phags pa is an example of an abugida because it has an inherent vowel but it is not an alphasyllabary because its vowels are written in linear order
modern lao is an example of an alphasyllabary that is not an abugida for there is no inherent vowel and its vowels are always written explicitly and not in accordance to their temporal order in speech meaning that a vowel can be written before below or above a consonant letter while the syllable is still pronounced in the order of a consonant vowel combination
the fundamental principles of an abugida apply to words made up of consonant vowel syllables
the syllables are written as letters in a straight line where each syllable is either a letter that represents the sound of a consonant and its inherent vowel or a letter modified to indicate the vowel
letters can be modified either by means of diacritics or by changes in the form of the letter itself
if all modifications are by diacritics and all diacritics follow the direction of the writing of the letters then the abugida is not an alphasyllabary
however most languages have words that are more complicated than a sequence of cv syllables even ignoring tone
the first complication is syllables that consist of just a vowel
for some languages a zero consonant letter is used as though every syllable began with a consonant
for other languages each vowel has a separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel
these letters are known as independent vowels and are found in most indic scripts
these letters may be quite different from the corresponding diacritics which by contrast are known as dependent vowels
as a result of the spread of writing systems independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with a glottal stop even for non initial syllables
the next two complications are consonant clusters before a vowel and syllables ending in a consonant
the simplest solution which is not always available is to break with the principle of writing words as a sequence of syllables and use a letter representing just a consonant
this final consonant may be represented with in a true abugida the lack of distinctive vowel marking of the letter may result from the diachronic loss of the inherent vowel eg by syncope and apocope in hindi
when not separating syllables containing consonant clusters into c cv these syllables are often written by combining the two consonants
in the indic scripts the earliest method was simply to arrange them vertically writing the second consonant of the cluster below the first one
the two consonants may also merge as conjunct consonant letters where two or more letters are graphically joined in a ligature or otherwise change their shapes
rarely one of the consonants may be replaced by a gemination mark eg the gurmukhi addak
when they are arranged vertically as in burmese or khmer they are said to be stacked
often there has been a change to writing the two consonants side by side
in the latter case this combination may be indicated by a diacritic on one of the consonants or a change in the form of one of the consonants eg the half forms of devanagari
generally the reading order of stacked consonants is top to bottom or the general reading order of the script but sometimes the reading order can be reversed
the division of a word into syllables for the purposes of writing does not always accord with the natural phonetics of the language
for example brahmic scripts commonly handle a phonetic sequence cvc cv as cv ccv or cv c cv
however sometimes phonetic cvc syllables are handled as single units and the final consonant may be represented more complicated unit structures are handled by combining the various techniques above
examples using the devanagari script there are three principal families of abugidas depending on whether vowels are indicated by modifying consonants by diacritics distortion or orientation
lao and tna have dependent vowels and a zero vowel sign but no inherent vowel
indic scripts originated in india and spread to southeast asia bangladesh sri lanka nepal bhutan tibet mongolia and russia
all surviving indic scripts are descendants of the brahmi alphabet
today they are used in most languages of south asia mainland southeast asia tibet indonesian archipelago philippines malaysia
the primary division is with north indic scripts used in northern india nepal tibet bhutan mongolia and russia and southern indic scripts used in south india sri lanka and southeast asia
south indic letter forms are more rounded than north indic forms though odia golmol and litumol of nepal script are rounded
most north indic scripts full letters incorporate a horizontal line at the top with gujarati and odia as exceptions south indic scripts do not
indic scripts indicate vowels through dependent vowel signs around the consonants often including a sign that explicitly indicates the lack of a vowel
if a consonant has no vowel sign this indicates a default vowel
vowel diacritics may appear above below to the left to the right or around the consonant
the most widely used indic script is devanagari shared by hindi bihari marathi konkani nepali and often sanskrit
a basic letter such as in hindi represents a syllable with the default vowel in this case ka
in some languages including hindi it becomes a final closing consonant at the end of a word in this case k
the inherent vowel may be changed by adding vowel mark producing syllables such as ki ku ke ko
in many of the brahmic scripts a syllable beginning with a cluster is treated as a single character for purposes of vowel marking so a vowel marker like i falling before the character it modifies may appear several positions before the place where it is pronounced
for example the game cricket in hindi is cricket the diacritic for appears before the consonant cluster not before the
a more unusual example is seen in the batak alphabet here the syllable bim is written ba ma i
that is the vowel diacritic and virama are both written after the consonants for the whole syllable
in many abugidas there is also a diacritic to suppress the inherent vowel yielding the bare consonant
in devanagari is k and is l
this is called the virma or halantam in sanskrit
it may be used to form consonant clusters or to indicate that a consonant occurs at the end of a word
thus in sanskrit a default vowel consonant such as does not take on a final consonant sound
instead it keeps its vowel
for writing two consonants without a vowel in between instead of using diacritics on the first consonant to remove its vowel another popular method of special conjunct forms is used in which two or more consonant characters are merged to express a cluster such as devanagari kla
thus a closed syllable such as kal requires two aksharas to write
the rng script used for the lepcha language goes further than other indic abugidas in that a single akshara can represent a closed syllable not only the vowel but any final consonant is indicated by a diacritic
for example the syllable would be written as something like s here with an underring representing and an overcross representing the diacritic for final
most other indic abugidas can only indicate a very limited set of final consonants with diacritics such as or if they can indicate any at all
in ethiopic or geez script fidels have diacritics that are fused with the consonants to the point that they must be considered modifications of the form of the letters
children learn each modification separately as in a syllabary nonetheless the graphic similarities between syllables with the same consonant are readily apparent unlike the case in a true syllabary
though now an abugida the geez script until the advent of christianity had originally been what would now be termed an abjad
in the geez abugida the base form of the letter may be altered
for example h hu hi h or
in the family known as canadian aboriginal syllabics which was inspired by the devanagari script of india vowels are indicated by changing the orientation of the syllabogram
each vowel has a consistent orientation for example inuktitut pi pu pa ti tu ta
although there is a vowel inherent in each all rotations have equal status and none can be identified as basic
bare consonants are indicated either by separate diacritics or by superscript versions of the aksharas there is no vowel killer mark
consonantal scripts are normally written without indication of many vowels
however in some contexts like teaching materials or scriptures arabic and hebrew are written with full indication of vowels via diacritic marks making them effectively alphasyllabaries
the brahmic and ethiopic families are thought to have originated from the semitic abjads by the addition of vowel marks
the arabic scripts used for kurdish in iraq and for uyghur in xinjiang china as well as the hebrew script of yiddish are fully vowelled but because the vowels are written with full letters rather than diacritics and there are no inherent vowels these are considered alphabets not abugidas
the arabic script used for south azerbaijani generally writes the vowel as a diacritic but writes all other vowels as full letters
this means that when no vowel diacritics are present it technically has an inherent vowel
however like the phagspa and meroitic scripts whose status as abugidas is controversial all other vowels are written in line
additionally the practice of explicitly writing all but one vowel does not apply to loanwords from arabic and persian so the script does not have an inherent vowel for arabic and persian words
the inconsistency of its vowel notation makes it difficult to categorize
the imperial mongol script called phagspa was derived from the tibetan abugida but all vowels are written in line rather than as diacritics
however it retains the features of having an inherent vowel a and having distinct initial vowel letters
pahawh hmong is a non segmental script that indicates syllable onsets and rimes such as consonant clusters and vowels with final consonants
thus it is not segmental and cannot be considered an abugida
however it superficially resembles an abugida with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed
most syllables are written with two letters in the order rime onset even though they are pronounced as onset rime rather like the position of the vowel in devanagari which is written before the consonant
pahawh is also unusual in that while an inherent rime is unwritten it also has an inherent onset
for the syllable which requires one or the other of the inherent sounds to be overt it is that is written
thus it is the rime that is basic to the system
it is difficult to draw a dividing line between abugidas and other segmental scripts
for example the meroitic script of ancient sudan did not indicate an inherent a and is thus similar to brahmic family of abugidas
however the other vowels were indicated with full letters not diacritics or modification so the system was essentially an alphabet that did not bother to write the most common vowel
several systems of shorthand use diacritics for vowels but they do not have an inherent vowel and are thus more similar to thaana and kurdish script than to the brahmic scripts
the gabelsberger shorthand system and its derivatives modify the following consonant to represent vowels
the pollard script which was based on shorthand also uses diacritics for vowels the placements of the vowel relative to the consonant indicates tone
pitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter circle marks in different orientations as the principal alphabet of consonants vowels are shown as light and heavy dots dashes and other marks in one of possible positions to indicate the various vowel sounds
however to increase writing speed pitman has rules for vowel indication using the positioning or choice of consonant signs so that writing vowel marks can be dispensed with
as the term alphasyllabary suggests abugidas have been considered an intermediate step between alphabets and syllabaries
historically abugidas appear to have evolved from abjads
they contrast with syllabaries where there is a distinct symbol for each syllable or consonant vowel combination and where these have no systematic similarity to each other and typically develop directly from logographic scripts
compare the examples above to sets of syllables in the japanese hiragana syllabary ka ki ku ke ko have nothing in common to indicate k while ra ri ru re ro have neither anything in common for r nor anything to indicate that they have the same vowels as the k set
most indian and indochinese abugidas appear to have first been developed from abjads with the kharoh and brhm scripts the abjad in question is usually considered to be the aramaic one but while the link between aramaic and kharosthi is more or less undisputed this is not the case with brahmi
the kharosthi family does not survive today but brahmis descendants include most of the modern scripts of south and southeast asia
geez derived from a different abjad the sabean script of yemen the advent of vowels coincided with the introduction or adoption of christianity about ad
the ethiopic script is the elaboration of an abjad
the cree syllabary was invented with full knowledge of the devanagari system
the meroitic script was developed from egyptian hieroglyphs within which various schemes of group writing had been used for showing vowels
abba are a swedish supergroup formed in stockholm in by agnetha fltskog bjrn ulvaeus benny andersson and anni frid lyngstad
the groups name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names arranged as a palindrome
they are one of the most popular and successful musical groups of all time and are one of the best selling music acts in the history of popular music topping the charts worldwide from to and in
in abba were s first winner of the eurovision song contest with the song waterloo which in was chosen as the best song in the competitions history as part of the of the contest
during the bands main active years it consisted of two married couples fltskog and ulvaeus and lyngstad and andersson
with the increase of their popularity their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages
the relationship changes were reflected in the groups music with later compositions featuring darker and more introspective lyrics
after abba disbanded in december andersson and ulvaeus continued their success writing music for multiple audiences including stage musicals and movies while fltskog and lyngstad pursued solo careers
ten years after the group broke up a compilation abba gold was released becoming a worldwide best seller
in abbas music was adapted into mamma mia a stage musical that toured worldwide and as of april is still in the top ten longest running productions on both broadway and the west end
a film of the same name released in became the highest grossing film in the united kingdom that year
a sequel mamma mia here we go again was released in
in the group reunited and started working on a digital avatar concert tour
newly recorded songs were announced in
voyage their first new album in years was released on november to positive critical reviews and strong sales in numerous countries
abba voyage a concert residency featuring abba as virtual avatars opened in may in london
abba are among the best selling music artists in history with million sold records worldwide and the group were ranked rd best selling singles artists in the united kingdom with a total of million singles sold by november
in may abba were awarded the brit billion award which celebrates those who have surpassed the milestone of one billion uk streams in their career
abba were the first group from a non english speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of english speaking countries including the united kingdom australia united states republic of ireland canada new zealand and south africa
they are the best selling swedish band of all time and the best selling band originating in continental europe
abba had eight consecutive number one albums in the uk
the group also enjoyed significant success in latin america and recorded a collection of their hit songs in spanish
abba were inducted into the vocal group hall of fame in
the group were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame in the first recording artists to receive this honour from outside an anglophonic country
in their song dancing queen was inducted into the recording academys grammy hall of fame
benny andersson became a member of a popular swedish pop rock group the hep stars that performed among other things covers of international hits
the hep stars were known as the swedish beatles
they also set up hep house their equivalent of apple corps
andersson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band many of which became major hits including no response which hit number three in and sunny girl wedding and consolation all of which hit number one in
andersson also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with lasse berghagen with whom he wrote his first svensktoppen entry sagan om lilla sofie in
bjrn ulvaeus also began his musical career at the age of when he fronted the hootenanny singers a popular swedish folk skiffle group
ulvaeus started writing english language songs for his group and even had a brief solo career alongside
the hootenanny singers and the hep stars sometimes crossed paths while touring
in june ulvaeus and andersson decided to write a song together
their first attempt was isnt it easy to say a song that was later recorded by the hep stars
stig anderson was the manager of the hootenanny singers and founder of the polar music label
he saw potential in the collaboration and encouraged them to write more
the two also began playing occasionally with the others bands on stage and on record although it was not until that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together ljuva sextital recorded by brita borg and the hep stars hit speleman
andersson wrote and submitted the song hej clown for melodifestivalen the national festival to select the swedish entry to the eurovision song contest
the song tied for first place but re voting relegated anderssons song to second place
on that occasion andersson briefly met his future spouse singer anni frid lyngstad who also participated in the contest
a month later the two had become a couple
as their respective bands began to break up during andersson and ulvaeus teamed up and recorded their first album together in called lycka which included original songs sung by both men
their partners were often present in the recording studio and sometimes added backing vocals fltskog even co wrote a song with the two
ulvaeus still occasionally recorded and performed with the hootenanny singers until the middle of and andersson took part in producing their records
anni frid frida lyngstad sang from the age of with various dance bands and worked mainly in a jazz oriented cabaret style
she also formed her own band the anni frid four
in the middle of she won a national talent competition with en ledig dag a swedish version of the bossa nova song a day in portofino which is included in the emi compilation frida
the first prize was a recording contract with emi sweden and to perform live on the most popular tv shows in the country
this tv performance amongst many others is included in the hour documentary frida the dvd
lyngstad released several schlager style singles on emi with mixed success
when benny andersson started to produce her recordings in she had her first number one single min egen stad written by benny and featuring all the future abba members on backing vocals
lyngstad toured and performed regularly in the folkpark circuit and made appearances on radio and tv
she had a second number one single with man vill ju leva lite dessemellan in late
she had met ulvaeus briefly in during a talent contest and fltskog during a tv show in early
lyngstad linked up with her future bandmates in
on march she participated in the melodifestival where she met andersson for the first time
a few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern sweden and they soon became a couple
andersson produced her single peter pan in september her first collaboration with benny bjrn as they had written the song
andersson would then produce lyngstads debut studio album frida which was released in march
lyngstad also played in several revues and cabaret shows in stockholm between and
after abba formed she recorded another successful album in frida ensam which included the original swedish rendition of fernando a hit on the swedish radio charts before the english version was released by abba
agnetha fltskog sang with a local dance band headed by bernt enghardt who sent a demo recording of the band to karl gerhard lundkvist
the demo tape featured a song written and sung by agnetha jag var s kr
lundkvist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star
after going through considerable effort to locate the singer he arranged for agnetha to come to stockholm and to record two of her own songs
this led to agnetha at the age of having a number one record in sweden with a self composed song which later went on to sell over copies
she was soon noticed by the critics and songwriters as a talented singer songwriter of schlager style songs
fltskogs main inspiration in her early years was singers such as connie francis
along with her own compositions she recorded covers of foreign hits and performed them on tours in swedish folkparks
most of her biggest hits were self composed which was quite unusual for a female singer in the s
agnetha released four solo lps between and
she had many successful singles in the swedish charts
during filming of a swedish tv special in may fltskog met ulvaeus and they married on july
fltskog and ulvaeus eventually were involved in each others recording sessions and soon even andersson and lyngstad added backing vocals to fltskogs third studio album som jag r
in fltskog starred as mary magdalene in the original swedish production of jesus christ superstar and attracted favourable reviews
between and fltskog released five studio albums
an attempt at combining their talents occurred in april when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of cyprus
what started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the united nations soldiers stationed on the island
andersson and ulvaeus were at this time recording their first album together lycka which was to be released in september
fltskog and lyngstad added backing vocals on several tracks during june and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act festfolket on november in gothenburg
the cabaret show attracted generally negative reviews except for the performance of the andersson and ulvaeus hit hej gamle man the first bjrn and benny recording to feature all four
they also performed solo numbers from respective albums but the lukewarm reception convinced the foursome to shelve plans for working together for the time being and each soon concentrated on individual projects again
hej gamle man a song about an old salvation army soldier became the quartets first hit
the record was credited to bjrn benny and reached number five on the sales charts and number one on svensktoppen staying on the latter chart for weeks
it was during that the four artists began working together more adding vocals to the others recordings
fltskog andersson and ulvaeus toured together in may while lyngstad toured on her own
frequent recording sessions brought the foursome closer together during the summer
after the release of lycka two more singles credited to bjrn benny were released in sweden det kan ingen doktor hjlpa and tnk om jorden vore ung with more prominent vocals by fltskog and lyngstad and moderate chart success
fltskog and ulvaeus now married started performing together with andersson on a regular basis at the swedish folkparks in the middle of
stig anderson founder and owner of polar music was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by andersson and ulvaeus
one day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit he predicted
stig anderson encouraged ulvaeus and andersson to write a song for melodifestivalen and after two rejected entries in andersson and ulvaeus submitted their new song sg det med en sng for the contest choosing newcomer lena anderson to perform
the song came in third place encouraging stig anderson and became a hit in sweden
the first signs of foreign success came as a surprise as the andersson and ulvaeus single shes my kind of girl was released through epic records in japan in march giving the duo a top hit
two more singles were released in japan en carousel and love has its ways
ulvaeus and andersson persevered with their songwriting and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements
people need love was released in june featuring guest vocals by the women who were now given much greater prominence
stig anderson released it as a single credited to bjrn benny agnetha anni frid
the song peaked at number in the swedish combined single and album charts enough to convince them they were on to something
the single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the united states where it peaked at number on the cashbox singles chart and number on the record world singles chart
labelled as bjrn benny meaning swedish girl it was released there through playboy records
according to stig anderson people need love could have been a much bigger american hit but a small label like playboy records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers
in the band and their manager stig anderson decided to have another try at melodifestivalen this time with the song ring ring
the studio sessions were handled by michael b
tretow who experimented with a wall of sound production technique that became a distinctive new sound thereafter associated with abba
stig anderson arranged an english translation of the lyrics by neil sedaka and phil cody and they thought this would be a success
however on february the song came third in melodifestivalen thus it never reached the eurovision song contest itself
nevertheless the group released their debut studio album also called ring ring
the album did well and the ring ring single was a hit in many parts of europe and also in south africa
however stig anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a uk or us hit
when agnetha fltskog gave birth to her daughter linda in she was replaced for a short period by inger brundin on a trip to west germany
in stig anderson tired of unwieldy names started to refer to the group privately and publicly as abba
at first this was a play on words as abba is also the name of a well known fish canning company in sweden and itself an abbreviation
however since the fish canners were unknown outside sweden anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets
a competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a gothenburg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as abba
the group negotiated with the canners for the rights to the name
fred bronson reported for billboard that fltskog told him in a interview that had to ask permission and the factory said ok as long as you dont make us feel ashamed for what youre doing
abba is an acronym formed from the first letters of each group members first name agnetha bjrn benny anni frid although there has never been any official confirmation of who each letter in the sequence refers to
the earliest known example of abba written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the metronome studio in stockholm dated october
this was first written as bjrn benny agnetha frida but was subsequently crossed out with abba written in large letters on top
their official logo distinct with the backward b was designed by rune sderqvist who designed most of abbas record sleeves
the ambigram first appeared on the french compilation album golden double album released in may by disques vogue and would henceforth be used for all official releases
the idea for the official logo was made by the german photographer on a velvet jumpsuit photo shoot for the teenage magazine bravo
in the photo the abba members held giant initial letters of their names
after the pictures were made heilemann found out that benny andersson reversed his letter b this prompted discussions about the mirrored b and the members of abba agreed on the mirrored letter
from onward the first b in the logo version of the name was mirror image reversed on the bands promotional material thus becoming the groups registered trademark
following their acquisition of the groups catalogue polygram began using variations of the abba logo employing a different font
in polygram added a crown emblem to it for the first release of the abba gold greatest hits compilation
after universal music purchased polygram control of the groups catalogue returned to stockholm
since then the original logo has been reinstated on all official products
as the group entered the melodifestivalen with ring ring but failed to qualify as the swedish entry stig anderson immediately started planning for the contest
ulvaeus andersson and stig anderson believed in the possibilities of using the eurovision song contest as a way to make the music business aware of them as songwriters as well as the band itself
in late they were invited by swedish television to contribute a song for the melodifestivalen and from a number of new songs the upbeat song waterloo was chosen the group were now inspired by the growing glam rock scene in england
abba won their nations hearts on swedish television on february and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the eurovision song contest
winning the eurovision song contest on april gave abba the chance to tour europe and perform on major television shows thus the band saw the waterloo single chart in many european countries
following their success at the eurovision song contest abba spent an evening of glory partying in the appropriately named first floor napoleon suite of the grand brighton hotel
waterloo was abbas first major hit in numerous countries becoming their first number one single in nine western and northern european countries including the big markets of the uk and west germany and in south africa
it also made the top ten in several other countries including rising to number three in spain number four in australia and france and number seven in canada
in the united states the song peaked at number six on the billboard hot chart paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there
albeit a short promotional visit it included their first performance on american television the mike douglas show
the album waterloo only peaked at number on the billboard chart but received unanimous high praise from the us critics los angeles times called it a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively
an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project while creem characterised it as a perfect blend of exceptional lovable compositions
abbas follow up single honey honey peaked at number on the us billboard hot reached the top twenty in several other countries and was a number two hit in west germany although it only reached the top in australia and the us
in the united kingdom abbas british record label epic decided to re release a remixed version of ring ring instead of honey honey and a cover version of the latter by sweet dreams peaked at number
both records debuted on the uk chart within one week of each other
ring ring failed to reach the top in the uk increasing growing speculation that the group were simply a eurovision one hit wonder
in november abba embarked on their first european tour playing dates in denmark west germany and austria
it was not as successful as the band had hoped since most of the venues did not sell out
due to a lack of demand they were even forced to cancel a few shows including a sole concert scheduled in switzerland
the second leg of the tour which took them through scandinavia in january was very different
they played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for
live performances continued in the middle of when abba embarked on a fourteen open air date tour of sweden and finland
their stockholm show at the grna lund amusement park had an estimated audience of
bjrn ulvaeus later said if you look at the singles we released straight after waterloo we were trying to be more like the sweet a semi glam rock group which was stupid because we were always a pop group
in late so long was released as a single in the united kingdom but it received no airplay from radio and failed to chart in the uk the only countries in which it was successful were austria sweden and germany reaching the top ten in the first two and number in the latter
in the middle of abba released i do i do i do i do i do which again received little airplay on radio but did manage to climb to number on the uk chart while making top five in several northern and western european countries and number one in south africa
later that year the release of their self titled third studio album abba and single sos brought back their chart presence in the uk where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number
sos also became abbas second number one single in germany their third in australia and their first in france plus reached number two in several other european countries including italy
success was further solidified with mamma mia reaching number one in the united kingdom germany and australia and the top two in a few other western and northern european countries
in the united states both i do i do i do i do i do and sos peaked at number on the billboard hot chart with the latter picking up the bmi award along the way as one of the most played songs on american radio in
mamma mia however stalled at number
in canada the three songs rose to number nine and respectively
the success of the group in the united states had until that time been limited to single releases
by early the group already had four top singles on the us charts but the album market proved to be tough to crack
the eponymous abba album generated three american hits but it only peaked at number on the cashbox album chart and number on the billboard chart
opinions were voiced by creem in particular that in the us abba had endured a very sloppy promotional campaign
nevertheless the group enjoyed warm reviews from the american press
cashbox went as far as saying that there is a recurrent thread of taste and artistry inherent in abbas marketing creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts while creem wrote sos is surrounded on this lp by so many good tunes that the mind boggles
in australia the airing of the music videos for i do i do i do i do i do and mamma mia on the nationally broadcast tv pop show countdown saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity and countdown become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos
this started an immense interest for abba in australia resulting in i do i do i do i do i do staying at number one for three weeks then sos spending a week there followed by mamma mia staying there for ten weeks and the album holding down the number one position for months
the three songs were also successful in nearby new zealand with the first two topping that chart and the third reaching number two
in march the band released the compilation album greatest hits
it became their first uk number one album and also took abba into the top on the us album charts for the first time eventually selling more than a million copies there
also included on greatest hits was a new single fernando which went to number one in at least thirteen countries all over the world including the uk germany france australia south africa and mexico and the top five in most other significant markets including at number four becoming their biggest hit to date in canada the single went on to sell over million copies worldwide
in australia fernando occupied the top position for a then record breaking weeks and was the longest running chart topper there for over years until it was overtaken by ed sheerans shape of you in may
it still remains as one of the best selling singles of all time in australia
also in the group received its first international prize with fernando being chosen as the best studio recording of
in the united states fernando reached the top of the cashbox top singles chart and number on the billboard hot
it topped the billboard adult contemporary chart abbas first american number one single on any chart
at the same time a compilation named the very best of abba was released in germany becoming a number one album there whereas the greatest hits compilation which followed a few months later ascended to number two in germany despite all similarities with the very best album
the groups fourth studio album arrival a number one best seller in parts of europe the uk and australia and a number three hit in canada and japan represented a new level of accomplishment in both songwriting and studio work prompting rave reviews from more rock oriented uk music weeklies such as melody maker and new musical express and mostly appreciative notices from us critics
hit after hit flowed from arrival money money money another number one in germany france australia and other countries of western and northern europe plus number two in the uk and knowing me knowing you abbas sixth consecutive german number one as well as another uk number one plus a top five hit in many other countries although it was only a number nine hit in australia and france
the real sensation was the first single dancing queen not only topping the charts in loyal markets like the uk germany sweden several other western and northern european countries and australia but also reaching number one in the united states canada the soviet union and japan and the top ten in france spain and italy
all three songs were number one hits in mexico
in south africa abba had astounding success with each of fernando dancing queen and knowing me knowing you being among the top best selling singles for
in arrival was nominated for the inaugural brit award in the category best international album of the year
by this time abba were popular in the uk most of europe australia new zealand and canada
in frida the dvd lyngstad explains how she and fltskog developed as singers as abbas recordings grew more complex over the years
the bands mainstream popularity in the united states would remain on a comparatively smaller scale and dancing queen became the only billboard hot number one single for abba with knowing me knowing you later peaking at number seven money money money however had barely charted there or in canada
they did however get three more singles to the number one position on other billboard us charts including billboard adult contemporary and hot dance club play
nevertheless arrival finally became a true breakthrough release for abba on the us album market where it peaked at number on the billboard chart and was certified gold by riaa
in january abba embarked on their first major tour
the groups status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as superstars
they opened their much anticipated tour in oslo norway on january and mounted a lavishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self written mini operetta the girl with the golden hair
the concert attracted immense media attention from across europe and australia
they continued the tour through western europe visiting gothenburg copenhagen berlin cologne amsterdam antwerp essen hanover and hamburg and ending with shows in the united kingdom in manchester birmingham glasgow and two sold out concerts at londons royal albert hall
tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box office received million requests for tickets enough to fill the venue times
along with praise there were complaints that abba performed slickly
but with a zero personality coming across from a total of people on stage
one of the royal albert hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the australian tour for what became though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed
after the european leg of the tour in march abba played dates in australia before a total of people
the opening concert in sydney at the sydney showground on march to an audience of was marred by torrential rain with lyngstad slipping on the wet stage during the concert
however all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career

there is simply no motivation to re group
money is not a factor and we would like people to remember us as we were
young exuberant full of energy and ambition
i remember robert plant saying led zeppelin were a cover band now because they cover all their own stuff
i think that hit the nail on the head
however on january fltskog long considered to be the most reclusive member of the group and a major obstacle to any reunion raised the possibility of reuniting for a one off engagement
she admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members
in april she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with die zeit stating if they ask me ill say yes
in a may interview fltskog aged at the time stated that an abba reunion would never occur i think we have to accept that it will not happen because we are too old and each one of us has their own life
too many years have gone by since we stopped and theres really no meaning in putting us together again
fltskog further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms its always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic
in an april interview fltskog when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said its difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be abba is going to record another song but as long as we can sing and play then why not i would love to but its up to bjrn and benny
the same year the members of abba went their separate ways the french production of a tribute show spawned new interest in the groups music
after receiving little attention during the mid to late s abbas music experienced a resurgence in the early s due to the uk synth pop duo erasure who released abba esque a four track extended play release featuring cover versions of abba songs which topped several european charts in

in april longtime abba guitarist lasse wellander died at the age of wellander played on seven of the groups nine studio albums including voyage
abba were perfectionists in the studio working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back to later on
they spent the bulk of their time within the studio in separate interviews ulvaeus stated they may have toured for only months while andersson said they played fewer than shows during the bands career
the band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer guitarist and bass player and overlaid other arrangements and instruments
vocals were then added and orchestra overdubs were usually left until last
fltskog and lyngstad contributed ideas at the studio stage
andersson and ulvaeus played them the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions
according to fltskog she and lyngstad had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped
abba was widely noted for the colourful and trend setting costumes its members wore
the reason for the wild costumes was swedish tax law the cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances
in their early years group member anni frid lyngstad designed and even hand sewed the outfits
later as their success grew they used professional theatrical clothes designer owe sandstrm together with tailor lars wigenius with lyngstad continuing to suggest ideas whilst co ordinating the outfits with concert set designs
choreography by graham tainton also contributed to their performance style
the videos that accompanied some of the bands biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre
most of abbas videos were directed by lasse hallstrm who would later direct the films my life as a dog the cider house rules and chocolat
abba made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible
this was also done in an effort to minimise travelling particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights
fltskog and ulvaeus had two young children and fltskog who was also afraid of flying was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time
abbas manager stig anderson realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to publicise a single or album thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour
some of these videos have become classics because of the s era costumes and early video effects such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs overlapping one singers profile with the others full face and the contrasting of one member against another
in abba participated in an advertising campaign to promote the matsushita electric industrial co
s brand national in australia
the campaign was also broadcast in japan
five commercial spots each of approximately one minute were produced each presenting the national song performed by abba using the melody and instrumental arrangements of fernando and revised lyrics

the band threatened to file a lawsuit against the df saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party
their record label universal music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached
during their active career from to of abbas singles entered the billboard hot of these made the top with making the top on both charts
a total of four of those singles reached the top including dancing queen which reached number one in april
while fernando and sos did not break the top on the billboard hot they did reach the top on cashbox and record world charts
both dancing queen and take a chance on me were certified gold by the recording industry association of america for sales of over one million copies each
the group also had top singles on the billboard adult contemporary chart with two of them fernando and the winner takes it all reaching number one

on march abba were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame by bee gees members barry gibb and robin gibb
the ceremony was held at the waldorf astoria hotel in new york city
the group were represented by anni frid lyngstad and benny andersson
in november abba received a grammy nomination for record of the year
the single i still have faith in you from the album voyage was their first ever nomination
the members of abba were married as follows agnetha fltskog and bjrn ulvaeus from to benny andersson and anni frid lyngstad from to
for their subsequent marriages see their articles
in addition to the four members of abba other musicians regularly played on their studio recordings live appearances and concert performances
these include studio albums an allegiance is a duty of fidelity said to be owed or freely committed by the people subjects or citizens to their state or sovereign
the word allegiance comes from middle english
the al prefix was probably added through confusion with another legal term allegeance an allegation
allegiance is formed from liege from old french liege free of germanic origin
the connection with latin to bind is erroneous
traditionally english legal commentators used the term allegiance in two ways
in one sense it referred to the deference which anyone even foreigners was expected to pay to the institutions of the country where one lived
in the other sense it meant national character and the subjection due to that character
the english doctrine which was at one time adopted in the united states asserted that allegiance was indelible nemo potest exuere patriam
as the law stood prior to every person who by birth or naturalisation satisfied the conditions set forth even if removed in infancy to another country where their family resided owed an allegiance to the british crown which they could never resign or lose except by act of parliament or by the recognition of the independence or the cession of the portion of british territory in which they resided
this refusal to accept any renunciation of allegiance to the crown led to conflict with the united states over impressment which led to further conflicts during the war of when thirteen irish american prisoners of war were executed as traitors after the battle of queenston heights winfield scott urged american reprisal but none was carried out
allegiance was the tie which bound the subject to the sovereign in return for that protection which the sovereign afforded the subject
it was the mutual bond and obligation between monarch and subjects whereby subjects were called their liege subjects because they are bound to obey and serve them and the monarch was called their liege lord because they should maintain and defend them el el er china navigation co v attorney general tlr attorney general v nissan all er oppenheimer v cattermole and arsenite as
in the united states since the maximum concentration in drinking water allowed by the environmental protection agency is ppb and the fda set the same standard in for bottled water
the department of environmental protection for new jersey set a drinking water limit of ppb in
the idlh value for arsenic metal and inorganic arsenic compounds is mg m
the occupational safety and health administration has set the permissible exposure limit to a time weighted average of mg m and the national institute for occupational safety and health has set the recommended exposure limit to a minute constant exposure of mg m
the pel for organic arsenic compounds is a twa of mg m
in based on its ongoing testing of a wide variety of american foods for toxic chemicals the us food and drug administration set the level of concern for inorganic arsenic in apple and pear juices at ppb based on non carcinogenic effects and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level it also required recalls for non conforming domestic products
in the national dr oz television show broadcast a program highlighting tests performed by an independent lab hired by the producers
though the methodology was disputed the tests showed levels of arsenic up to ppb
in response the fda tested the worst brand from the dr oz show and found much lower levels
ongoing testing found of the apple juice samples were below the level of concern
later testing by consumer reports showed inorganic arsenic at levels slightly above ppb and the organization urged parents to reduce consumption
in july on consideration of consumption by children chronic exposure and carcinogenic effect the fda established an action level of ppb for apple juice the same as the drinking water standard
concern about arsenic in rice in bangladesh was raised in but at the time only australia had a legal limit for food
concern was raised about people who were eating us rice exceeding who standards for personal arsenic intake in
in the peoples republic of china set a food standard of ppb for arsenic
in the united states in testing by separate groups of researchers at the childrens environmental health and disease prevention research center at dartmouth college and consumer reports found levels of arsenic in rice that resulted in calls for the fda to set limits
the fda released some testing results in september and as of july is still collecting data in support of a new potential regulation
it has not recommended any changes in consumer behavior
a world health organization advisory conference was scheduled to consider limits of ppb for rice
in scientists assessed multiple preparation procedures of rice for their capacity to reduce arsenic content and preserve nutrients recommending a procedure involving parboiling and water absorption
arsenic is bioaccumulative in many organisms marine species in particular but it does not appear to biomagnify significantly in food webs
in polluted areas plant growth may be affected by root uptake of arsenate which is a phosphate analog and therefore readily transported in plant tissues and cells
in polluted areas uptake of the more toxic arsenite ion is likely in poorly drained soils
arsenics toxicity comes from the affinity of arsenic oxides for thiols
thiols in the form of cysteine residues and cofactors such as lipoic acid and coenzyme a are situated at the active sites of many important enzymes
arsenic disrupts atp production through several mechanisms
at the level of the citric acid cycle arsenic inhibits lipoic acid which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase
by competing with phosphate arsenate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation thus inhibiting energy linked reduction of nad mitochondrial respiration and atp synthesis
hydrogen peroxide production is also increased which it is speculated has potential to form reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress
these metabolic interferences lead to death from multi system organ failure
the organ failure is presumed to be from necrotic cell death not apoptosis since energy reserves have been too depleted for apoptosis to occur
occupational exposure and arsenic poisoning may occur in persons working in industries involving the use of inorganic arsenic and its compounds such as wood preservation glass production nonferrous metal alloys and electronic semiconductor manufacturing
inorganic arsenic is also found in coke oven emissions associated with the smelter industry
the conversion between as and as is a large factor in arsenic environmental contamination
according to croal gralnick malasarn and newman understanding cl and the al o bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form al cl bonds instead all four trihalides are well known
unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides aluminium fluoride features six coordinate aluminium which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high heat of formation
each aluminium atom is surrounded by six fluorine atoms in a distorted octahedral arrangement with each fluorine atom being shared between the corners of two octahedra
such alf units also exist in complex fluorides such as cryolite naalf
alf melts at and is made by reaction of aluminium oxide with hydrogen fluoride gas at
with heavier halides the coordination numbers are lower
the other trihalides are dimeric or polymeric with tetrahedral four coordinate aluminium centers
aluminium trichloride has a layered polymeric structure below its melting point of but transforms on melting to alcl dimers
at higher temperatures those increasingly dissociate into trigonal planar alcl monomers similar to the structure of bcl
aluminium tribromide and aluminium triiodide form alx dimers in all three phases and hence do not show such significant changes of properties upon phase change
these materials are prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen
the aluminium trihalides form many addition compounds or complexes their lewis acidic nature makes them useful as catalysts for the friedel crafts reactions
aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction such as in the manufacture of anthraquinones and styrene it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides
aluminium forms one stable oxide with the chemical formula alo commonly called alumina
it can be found in nature in the mineral corundum alumina there is also a alumina phase
its crystalline form corundum is very hard has a high melting point of has very low volatility is chemically inert and a good electrical insulator it is often used in abrasives as a refractory material and in ceramics as well as being the starting material for the electrolytic production of aluminium metal
sapphire and ruby are impure corundum contaminated with trace amounts of other metals
the two main oxide hydroxides alo are boehmite and diaspore
there are three main trihydroxides bayerite gibbsite and nordstrandite which differ in their crystalline structure
many other intermediate and related structures are also known
most are produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base
heating the hydroxides leads to formation of corundum
these materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are themselves extremely useful
some mixed oxide phases are also very useful such as spinel na alumina and tricalcium aluminate
the only stable chalcogenides under normal conditions are aluminium sulfide selenide and telluride
all three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about and quickly hydrolyze completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective hydrogen chalcogenide
as aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens these have four coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to wurtzite with two thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly or random fashion the sulfide also has a form related to alumina and an unusual high temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium atoms have tetrahedral four coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five coordination
four pnictides aluminium nitride aluminium phosphide aluminium arsenide and aluminium antimonide are known
they are all iii v semiconductors isoelectronic to silicon and germanium all of which but aln have the zinc blende structure
all four can be made by high temperature direct reaction of their component elements
c is made by heating a mixture of the elements above
the pale yellow crystals consist of tetrahedral aluminium centers
it reacts with water or dilute acids to give methane
the acetylide al is made by passing acetylene over heated aluminium
aluminium nitride is the only nitride known for aluminium
unlike the oxides it features tetrahedral al centers
it can be made from the elements at
it is air stable material with a usefully high thermal conductivity
aluminium phosphide is made similarly it hydrolyses to give phosphine aluminium alloys well with most other metals and over intermetallics with other metals are known
preparation involves heating fixed metals together in certain proportion followed by gradual cooling and annealing
bonding in them is predominantly metallic and the crystal structure primarily depends on efficiency of packing
there are few compounds with lower oxidation states
a few aluminium compounds exist alf alcl albr and ali exist in the gaseous phase when the respective trihalide is heated with aluminium and at cryogenic temperatures
a stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic adduct formed with triethylamine ali
alo and als also exist but are very unstable
very simple aluminium compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of al metal with oxidants
for example aluminium monoxide alo has been detected in the gas phase after explosion and in stellar absorption spectra
more thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula ral which contain an al al bond and where r is a large organic ligand
a variety of compounds of empirical formula alr and alrcl exist
the aluminium trialkyls and triaryls are reactive volatile and colorless liquids or low melting solids
they catch fire spontaneously in air and react with water thus necessitating precautions when handling them
they often form dimers unlike their boron analogues but this tendency diminishes for branched chain alkyls for example triisobutylaluminium exists as an equilibrium mixture of the monomer and dimer
these dimers such as trimethylaluminium usually feature tetrahedral al centers formed by dimerization with some alkyl group bridging between both aluminium atoms
they are hard acids and react readily with ligands forming adducts
in industry they are mostly used in alkene insertion reactions as discovered by karl ziegler most importantly in growth reactions that form long chain unbranched primary alkenes and alcohols and in the low pressure polymerization of ethene and propene
there are also some heterocyclic and cluster organoaluminium compounds involving al n bonds
the industrially most important aluminium hydride is lithium aluminium hydride which is used in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry
it can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium trichloride
the simplest hydride aluminium hydride or alane is not as important
it is a polymer with the formula n in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula
aluminiums per particle abundance in the solar system is ppm
it is the twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic numbers after hydrogen and nitrogen
the only stable isotope of aluminium al is the eighteenth most abundant nucleus in the universe
it is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars that will later become type ii supernovas this fusion creates mg which upon capturing free protons and neutrons becomes aluminium
some smaller quantities of al are created in hydrogen burning shells of evolved stars where mg can capture free protons
essentially all aluminium now in existence is al
al was present in the early solar system with abundance of relative to al but its half life of years is too short for any original nuclei to survive al is therefore extinct
unlike for al hydrogen burning is the primary source of al with the nuclide emerging after a nucleus of mg catches a free proton
however the trace quantities of al that do exist are the most common gamma ray emitter in the interstellar gas if the original al were still present gamma ray maps of the milky way would be brighter
overall the earth is about aluminium by mass
aluminium occurs in greater proportion in the earths crust than in the universe at large because aluminium easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and stays in the earths crust while less reactive metals sink to the core
in the earths crust aluminium is the most abundant metallic element and the third most abundant of all elements
a large number of silicates in the earths crust contain aluminium
in contrast the earths mantle is only aluminium by mass
aluminium also occurs in seawater at a concentration of g kg
because of its strong affinity for oxygen aluminium is almost never found in the elemental state instead it is found in oxides or silicates
feldspars the most common group of minerals in the earths crust are aluminosilicates
aluminium also occurs in the minerals beryl cryolite garnet spinel and turquoise
impurities in alo such as chromium and iron yield the gemstones ruby and sapphire respectively
native aluminium metal is extremely rare and can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen fugacity environments such as the interiors of certain volcanoes
native aluminium has been reported in cold seeps in the northeastern continental slope of the south china sea
it is possible that these deposits resulted from bacterial reduction of tetrahydroxoaluminate al
although aluminium is a common and widespread element not all aluminium minerals are economically viable sources of the metal
almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the ore bauxite x
bauxite occurs as a weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic conditions
in most bauxite was mined in australia china guinea and india
the history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum
the first written record of alum made by greek historian herodotus dates back to the th century bce
the ancients are known to have used alum as a dyeing mordant and for city defense
after the crusades alum an indispensable good in the european fabric industry was a subject of international commerce it was imported to europe from the eastern mediterranean until the mid th century
the nature of alum remained unknown
around swiss physician paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum
in german doctor and chemist andreas libavius experimentally confirmed this
in german chemist friedrich hoffmann announced his belief that the base of alum was a distinct earth
in german chemist andreas sigismund marggraf synthesized alumina by boiling clay in sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash
attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to
the first successful attempt however was completed in by danish physicist and chemist hans christian rsted
he reacted anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin
he presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in
in german chemist friedrich whler repeated rsteds experiments but did not identify any aluminium
he conducted a similar experiment in the same year by mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium
in he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal
for many years thereafter whler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium
as whlers method could not yield great quantities of aluminium the metal remained rare its cost exceeded that of gold
the first industrial production of aluminium was established in by french chemist henri etienne sainte claire deville and companions
deville had discovered that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium which was more convenient and less expensive than potassium which whler had used
even then aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium differed in properties by sample
because of its electricity conducting capacity aluminium was used as the cap of the washington monument completed in
the tallest building in the world at the time the non corroding metal cap was intended to serve as a lightning rod peak
the first industrial large scale production method was independently developed in by french engineer paul hroult and american engineer charles martin hall it is now known as the hall hroult process
the hall hroult process converts alumina into metal
austrian chemist carl joseph bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite to yield alumina now known as the bayer process in
modern production of the aluminium metal is based on the bayer and hall hroult processes
prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry everyday items eyeglass frames optical instruments tableware and foil in the s and early th century
aluminiums ability to form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal with many uses at the time
during world war i major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes during world war ii demand by major governments for aviation was even higher
by the mid th century aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of housewares
in production of aluminium surpassed that of copper historically second in production only to iron making it the most produced non ferrous metal
during the mid th century aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material with building applications in both basic construction and interior finish work and increasingly being used in military engineering for both airplanes and land armor vehicle engines
earths first artificial satellite launched in consisted of two separate aluminium semi spheres joined and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent
the aluminium can was invented in and employed as a storage for drinks in
throughout the th century the production of aluminium rose rapidly while the world production of aluminium in was metric tons the annual production first exceeded metric tons in tons in tons in
in the s the increased demand for aluminium made it an exchange commodity it entered the london metal exchange the oldest industrial metal exchange in the world in
the output continued to grow the annual production of aluminium exceeded metric tons in
the real price for aluminium declined from per metric ton in to in
extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and the scale of the economies
however the need to exploit lower grade poorer quality deposits and the use of fast increasing input costs increased the net cost of aluminium the real price began to grow in the s with the rise of energy cost
production moved from the industrialized countries to countries where production was cheaper
production costs in the late th century changed because of advances in technology lower energy prices exchange rates of the united states dollar and alumina prices
the bric countries combined share in primary production and primary consumption grew substantially in the first decade of the st century
china is accumulating an especially large share of the worlds production thanks to an abundance of resources cheap energy and governmental stimuli it also increased its consumption share from in to in
in the united states western europe and japan most aluminium was consumed in transportation engineering construction and packaging
in prices for industrial metals such as aluminium have soared to near record levels as energy shortages in china drive up costs for electricity
the names aluminium and aluminum are derived from the word alumine an obsolete term for alumina a naturally occurring oxide of aluminium
alumine was borrowed from french which in turn derived it from alumen the classical latin name for alum the mineral from which it was collected
the latin word alumen stems from the proto indo european root alu meaning bitter or beer
british chemist humphry davy who performed a number of experiments aimed to isolate the metal is credited as the person who named the element
the first name proposed for the metal to be isolated from alum was alumium which davy suggested in an article on his electrochemical research published in philosophical transactions of the royal society
it appeared that the name was created from the english word alum and the latin suffix ium but it was customary then to give elements names originating in latin so this name was not adopted universally
this name was criticized by contemporary chemists from france germany and sweden who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide alumina from which it would be isolated
the english name alum does not come directly from latin whereas alumine alumina obviously comes from the latin word alumen
one example was essai sur la nomenclature chimique written in french by a swedish chemist jns jacob berzelius in which the name aluminium is given to the element that would be synthesized from alum
a january summary of one of davys lectures at the royal society mentioned the name aluminium as a possibility
the next year davy published a chemistry textbook in which he used the spelling aluminum
both spellings have coexisted since
their usage is regional aluminum dominates in the united states and canada aluminium in the rest of the english speaking world
in a british scientist thomas young wrote an anonymous review of davys book in which he proposed the name aluminium instead of aluminum which he thought had a less classical sound
this name did catch on although the spelling was occasionally used in britain the american scientific language used from the start
most scientists throughout the world used in the th century and it was entrenched in many other european languages such as french german and dutch
in an american lexicographer noah webster entered only the aluminum spelling in his american dictionary of the english language
in the s the spelling gained usage in the united states by the s it had become the more common spelling there outside science
in hall used the spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the metal despite his constant use of the spelling in all the patents he filed between and it is unknown whether this spelling was introduced by mistake or intentionally but hall preferred aluminum since its introduction because it resembled platinum the name of a prestigious metal
by both spellings had been common in the united states the spelling being slightly more common by the situation had reversed by aluminum had become twice as common as aluminium in the next decade the spelling dominated american usage
in the american chemical society adopted this spelling
the international union of pure and applied chemistry adopted aluminium as the standard international name for the element in
in they recognized aluminum as an acceptable variant the most recent edition of the iupac nomenclature of inorganic chemistry also acknowledges this spelling
iupac official publications use the spelling as primary and they list both where it is appropriate
the production of aluminium starts with the extraction of bauxite rock from the ground
the bauxite is processed and transformed using the bayer process into alumina which is then processed using the hall hroult process resulting in the final aluminium metal
aluminium production is highly energy consuming and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive
as of the worlds largest smelters of aluminium are located in china india russia canada and the united arab emirates while china is by far the top producer of aluminium with a world share of fifty five percent
according to the international resource panels metal stocks in society report the global per capita stock of aluminium in use in society is
much of this is in more developed countries rather than less developed countries
bauxite is converted to alumina by the bayer process
bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then is ground
the resulting slurry is mixed with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide the mixture is then treated in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite while converting impurities into relatively insoluble compounds after this reaction the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point
it is cooled by removing steam as pressure is reduced
the bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded
the solution free of solids is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide this causes decomposition of the ions to aluminium hydroxide
after about half of aluminium has precipitated the mixture is sent to classifiers
small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve as seeding agents coarse particles are converted to alumina by heating the excess solution is removed by evaporation purified and recycled
the conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the hall hroult process
in this energy intensive process a solution of alumina in a molten mixture of cryolite with calcium fluoride is electrolyzed to produce metallic aluminium
the liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution and is tapped off and usually cast into large blocks called aluminium billets for further processing
anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon the most resistant material against fluoride corrosion and either bake at the process or are prebaked
the former also called sderberg anodes are less power efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect which is why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power energy and labor to prebake the cathodes
carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the electrolyte is contaminated with ash
despite carbons resistivity against corrosion it is still consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium
cathodes are made of anthracite high purity for them is not required because impurities leach only very slowly
the cathode is consumed at a rate of kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium
a cell is usually terminated after years following a failure of the cathode
the hall heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above
further purification can be done by the hoopes process
this process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium barium and aluminium fluoride electrolyte
the resulting aluminium has a purity of
electric power represents about to of the cost of producing aluminium depending on the location of the smelter
aluminium production consumes roughly of electricity generated in the united states
because of this alternatives to the hall hroult process have been researched but none has turned out to be economically feasible
recovery of the metal through recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry
recycling was a low profile activity until the late s when the growing use of aluminium beverage cans brought it to public awareness
recycling involves melting the scrap a process that requires only of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore though a significant part is lost as dross
an aluminium stack melter produces significantly less dross with values reported below
white dross from primary aluminium production and from secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of aluminium that can be extracted industrially
the process produces aluminium billets together with a highly complex waste material
this waste is difficult to manage
it reacts with water releasing a mixture of gases which spontaneously ignites on contact with air contact with damp air results in the release of copious quantities of ammonia gas
despite these difficulties the waste is used as a filler in asphalt and concrete
the global production of aluminium in was million metric tons
it exceeded that of any other metal except iron
aluminium is almost always alloyed which markedly improves its mechanical properties especially when tempered
for example the common aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of to aluminium
the main alloying agents are copper zinc magnesium manganese and silicon with the levels of other metals in a few percent by weight
aluminium both wrought and cast has been alloyed with manganese silicon magnesium copper and zinc among others
for example the kynal family of alloys was developed by the british chemical manufacturer imperial chemical industries
the great majority of aluminium oxide is converted to metallic aluminium
being a very hard material alumina is widely used as an abrasive being extraordinarily chemically inert it is useful in highly reactive environments such as high pressure sodium lamps
aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes eg the claus process to convert hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in refineries and to alkylate amines
many industrial catalysts are supported by alumina meaning that the expensive catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the inert alumina
another principal use is as a drying agent or absorbent
several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application
aluminium sulfate is produced on the annual scale of several millions of metric tons
about two thirds is consumed in water treatment
the next major application is in the manufacture of paper
it is also used as a mordant in dyeing in pickling seeds deodorizing of mineral oils in leather tanning and in production of other aluminium compounds
two kinds of alum ammonium alum and potassium alum were formerly used as mordants and in leather tanning but their use has significantly declined following availability of high purity aluminium sulfate
anhydrous aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst in chemical and petrochemical industries the dyeing industry and in synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds
aluminium hydroxychlorides are used in purifying water in the paper industry and as antiperspirants
sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an accelerator of solidification of cement
aluminizing is the process of coating a structure or material with a thin layer of aluminium
it is done to impart specific traits that the underlying substrate lacks such as a certain chemical or physical property
aluminized materials include despite its widespread occurrence in the earths crust aluminium has no known function in biology
at ph aluminium precipitates out of water as the hydroxide and is hence not available most elements behaving this way have no biological role or are toxic
aluminium sulfate has an ld of mg kg which corresponds to grams for a person
aluminium is classified as a non carcinogen by the united states department of health and human services
a review published in said that there was little evidence that normal exposure to aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult and a multi element toxicology review was unable to find deleterious effects of aluminium consumed in amounts not greater than mg day per kg of body mass
most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces most of the small part of it that enters the bloodstream will be excreted via urine nevertheless some aluminium does pass the blood brain barrier and is lodged preferentially in the brains of alzheimers patients
evidence published in indicates that for alzheimers patients aluminium may act by electrostatically crosslinking proteins thus down regulating genes in the superior temporal gyrus
aluminium although rarely can cause vitamin d resistant osteomalacia erythropoietin resistant microcytic anemia and central nervous system alterations
people with kidney insufficiency are especially at a risk
chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates may result in aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals such as iron or zinc sufficiently high doses can cause anemia
during the camelford water pollution incident people in camelford had their drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulfate for several weeks
a final report into the incident in concluded it was unlikely that this had caused long term health problems
aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of alzheimers disease but research into this for over years has found no good evidence of causal effect
aluminium increases estrogen related gene expression in human breast cancer cells cultured in the laboratory
in very high doses aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood brain barrier
a small percentage of people have contact allergies to aluminium and experience itchy red rashes headache muscle pain joint pain poor memory insomnia depression asthma irritable bowel syndrome or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium
exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium welding fumes can cause pulmonary fibrosis
fine aluminium powder can ignite or explode posing another workplace hazard
food is the main source of aluminium
drinking water contains more aluminium than solid food however aluminium in food may be absorbed more than aluminium from water
major sources of human oral exposure to aluminium include food drinking water and aluminium containing medications
dietary exposure in europeans averages to mg kg week but can be as high as mg kg week
higher exposure levels of aluminium are mostly limited to miners aluminium production workers and dialysis patients
consumption of antacids antiperspirants vaccines and cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure
consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium enhances aluminium absorption and maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium in nerve and bone tissues
in case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium the only treatment is deferoxamine mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation
however this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels but also those of other metals such as copper or iron
high levels of aluminium occur near mining sites small amounts of aluminium are released to the environment at the coal fired power plants or incinerators
aluminium in the air is washed out by the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium remain in the air for a long time
acidic precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize aluminium from natural sources and the main reason for the environmental effects of aluminium however the main factor of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial processes that also release aluminium into air
in water aluminium acts as a toxi agent on gill breathing animals such as fish when the water is acidic in which aluminium may precipitate on gills which causes loss of plasma and hemolymph ions leading to osmoregulatory failure
organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with metabolism in mammals and birds even though this rarely happens in practice
aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils
although it is generally harmless to plant growth in ph neutral soils in acid soils the concentration of toxic al cations increases and disturbs root growth and function
wheat has developed a tolerance to aluminium releasing organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations
sorghum is believed to have the same tolerance mechanism
aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production process
the major challenge is the greenhouse gas emissions
these gases result from electrical consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing
the most potent of these gases are perfluorocarbons from the smelting process
released sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of acid rain
biodegradation of metallic aluminium is extremely rare most aluminium corroding organisms do not directly attack or consume the aluminium but instead produce corrosive wastes
the fungus geotrichum candidum can consume the aluminium in compact discs
the bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene based fuels and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium
advanced chemistry is a german hip hop group from heidelberg a scenic city in baden wrttemberg south germany
advanced chemistry was founded in by toni l linguist gee one dj mike md and mc torch
each member of the group holds german citizenship and toni l linguist and torch are of italian ghanaian and haitian backgrounds respectively
influenced by north american socially conscious rap and the native tongues movement advanced chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in german hip hop
they were one of the first groups to rap in german
furthermore their songs tackled controversial social and political issues distinguishing them from early german hip hop group die fantastischen vier which had a more light hearted playful party image
advanced chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in germany and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied a german identity can cause
the song fremd im eigenen land was released by advanced chemistry in november
the single became a staple in the german hip hop scene
it made a strong statement about the status of immigrants throughout germany as the group was composed of multi national and multi racial members
the video shows several members brandishing their german passports as a demonstration of their german citizenship to skeptical and unaccepting ethnic germans
this idea of national identity is important as many rap artists in germany have been of foreign origin
these so called gastarbeiter children saw breakdance graffiti rap music and hip hop culture as a means of expressing themselves
since the release of fremd im eigenen land many other german language rappers have also tried to confront anti immigrant ideas and develop themes of citizenship
however though many ethnic minority youth in germany find these german identity themes appealing others view the desire of immigrants to be seen as german negatively and they have actively sought to revive and recreate concepts of identity in connection to traditional ethnic origins
advanced chemistry helped to found the german chapter of the zulu nation
the rivalry between advanced chemistry and die fantastischen vier has served to highlight a dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming a part of the german soundscape
while die fantastischen vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an aesthetic art form advanced chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created
for advanced chemistry hip hop is a vehicle of general human emancipation
in their undertaking of social and political issues the band introduced the term afro german into the context of german hip hop and the theme of race is highlighted in much of their music
with the release of the single fremd im eigenen land advanced chemistry separated itself from the rest of the rap being produced in germany
this single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating us rap and addressed the current issues of the time
fremd im eigenen land which translates to foreign in my own country dealt with the widespread racism that non white german citizens faced
this change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of german identification with rap
the sound of fremd im eigenen land was influenced by the wall of noise created by public enemys producers the bomb squad
after the reunification of germany an abundance of anti immigrant sentiment emerged as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early s
advanced chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro multicultural society stance in their music
advanced chemistrys attitudes revolve around their attempts to create a distinct germanness in hip hop as opposed to imitating american hip hop as other groups had done
torch has said what the americans do is exotic for us because we dont live like they do
what they do seems to be more interesting and newer
but not for me
for me its more exciting to experience my fellow germans in new contexts
for me its interesting to see what the kids try to do thats different from what i know
advanced chemistry were the first to use the term afro german in a hip hop context
this was part of the pro immigrant political message they sent via their music
while advanced chemistrys use of the german language in their rap allows them to make claims to authenticity and true german heritage bolstering pro immigration sentiment their style can also be problematic for immigrant notions of any real ethnic roots
indeed part of the turkish ethnic minority of frankfurt views advanced chemistrys appeal to the german image as a symbolic betrayal of the right of ethnic minorities to roots or to any expression of cultural heritage
in this sense their rap represents a complex social discourse internal to the german soundscape in which they attempt to negotiate immigrant assimilation into a xenophobic german culture with the maintenance of their own separate cultural traditions
it is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure blooded german demographic that drive advanced chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their germanness as a group composed primarily of ethnic others
the response to this pseudo german authenticity can be seen in what andy bennett refers to as alternative forms of local hip hop culture which actively seek to rediscover and in many cases reconstruct notions of identity tied to cultural roots
these alternative local hip hop cultures include oriental hip hop the members of which cling to their turkish heritage and are confused by advanced chemistrys elicitation of a german identity politics to which they technically do not belong
this cultural binary illustrates that rap has taken different routes in germany and that even among an already isolated immigrant population there is still disunity and especially disagreement on the relative importance of assimilation versus cultural defiance
according to german hip hop enthusiast home advanced chemistry is part of a hip hop movement took a clear stance for the minorities and against the is whoever can be understood to have produced a particular text as we interpret it not necessarily who penned the text
it is this distinction between producing a written work and producing the interpretation or meaning in a written work that both barthes and foucault are interested in
foucault warns of the risks of keeping the authors name in mind during interpretation because it could affect the value and meaning with which one handles an interpretation
literary critics barthes and foucault suggest that readers should not rely on or look for the notion of one overarching voice when interpreting a written work because of the complications inherent with a writers title of author
they warn of the dangers interpretations could suffer from when associating the subject of inherently meaningful words and language with the personality of one authorial voice
instead readers should allow a text to be interpreted in terms of the language as author
self publishing is a model where the author takes full responsibility and control of arranging financing editing printing and distribution of their own work
in other words the author also acts as the publisher of their work
with commissioned publishing the publisher makes all the publication arrangements and the author covers all expenses
the author of a work may receive a percentage calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold
publishers at times reduced the risk of this type of arrangement by agreeing only to pay this after a certain number of copies had sold
in canada this practice occurred during the s but was not commonplace until the s
established and successful authors may receive advance payments set against future royalties but this is no longer common practice
most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of net receipts how net receipts are calculated varies from publisher to publisher
under this arrangement the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication
the costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts
see compensation for more
vanity publishers normally charge a flat fee for arranging publication offer a platform for selling and then take a percentage of the sale of every copy of a book
the author receives the rest of the money made
most materials published this way are for niche groups and not for large audiences
vanity publishing or subsidy publishing is stigmatized in the professional world
in bill henderson defined vanity publishers as people who would publish anything for which an author will pay usually at a loss for the author and a nice profit for the publisher
in subsidy publishing the book sales are not the publishers main source of income but instead the fees that the authors are charged to initially produce the book are
because of this the vanity publishers need not invest into making books marketable as much as other publishers need to
this leads to low quality books being introduced to the market
the relationship between the author and the editor often the authors only liaison to the publishing company is often characterized as the site of tension
for the author to reach their audience often through publication the work usually must attract the attention of the editor
the idea of the author as the sole meaning maker of necessity changes to include the influences of the editor and the publisher to engage the audience in writing as a social act
there are three principal kinds of editing proofing story and layout
pierre bourdieus essay the field of cultural production depicts the publishing industry as a space of literary or artistic position takings also called the field of struggles which is defined by the tension and movement inherent among the various positions in the field
bourdieu claims that the field of position takings
is not the product of coherence seeking intention or objective consensus meaning that an industry characterized by position takings is not one of harmony and neutrality
in particular for the writer their authorship in their work makes their work part of their identity and there is much at stake personally over the negotiation of authority over that identity
however it is the editor who has the power to impose the dominant definition of the writer and therefore to delimit the population of those entitled to take part in the struggle to define the writer
as cultural investors publishers rely on the editor position to identify a good investment in cultural capital which may grow to yield economic capital across all positions
according to the studies of james curran the system of shared values among editors in britain has generated a pressure among authors to write to fit the editors expectations removing the focus from the reader audience and putting a strain on the relationship between authors and editors and on writing as a social act
even the book review by the editors has more significance than the readerships reception
authors rely on advance fees royalty payments adaptation of work to a screenplay and fees collected from giving speeches
a standard contract for an author will usually include provision for payment in the form of an advance and royalties
an advance is a lump sum paid in advance of publication
an advance must be earned out before royalties are payable
an advance may be paid in two lump sums the first payment on contract signing and the second on delivery of the completed manuscript or on publication
royalty payment is the sum paid to authors for each copy of a book sold and is traditionally around but self published authors can earn about royalties per each book sale
an authors contract may specify for example that they will earn of the retail price of each book sold
some contracts specify a scale of royalties payable
an authors book must earn the advance before any further royalties are paid
for example if an author is paid a modest advance of and their royalty rate is of a book priced at that is per book the book will need to sell copies before any further payment will be made
publishers typically withhold payment of a percentage of royalties earned against returns
in some countries authors also earn income from a government scheme such as the elr and plr schemes in australia
under these schemes authors are paid a fee for the number of copies of their books in educational and or public libraries
these days many authors supplement their income from book sales with public speaking engagements school visits residencies grants and teaching positions
ghostwriters technical writers and textbooks writers are typically paid in a different way usually a set fee or a per word rate rather than on a percentage of sales
in the year according to the us bureau of labor statistics nearly people worked in the us as authors making an average of per year
andrey andreyevich markov was a russian mathematician best known for his work on stochastic processes
a primary subject of his research later became known as the markov chain
he was also a strong close to master level chess player
markov and his younger brother vladimir andreevich markov proved the markov brothers inequality
his son another andrey andreyevich markov was also a notable mathematician making contributions to constructive mathematics and recursive function theory
andrey markov was born on june in russia
he attended the st
petersburg grammar school where some teachers saw him as a rebellious student
in his academics he performed poorly in most subjects other than mathematics
later in life he attended saint petersburg imperial university
among his teachers were yulian sokhotski konstantin posse yegor zolotarev pafnuty chebyshev aleksandr korkin mikhail okatov osip somov and nikolai budajev
he completed his studies at the university and was later asked if he would like to stay and have a career as a mathematician
he later taught at high schools and continued his own mathematical studies
in this time he found a practical use for his mathematical skills
he figured out that he could use chains to model the alliteration of vowels and consonants in russian literature
he also contributed to many other mathematical aspects in his time
he died at age on july
in markov was awarded a gold medal for his outstanding solution of the problem about integration of differential equations by continued fractions with an application to the equation formula
during the following year he passed the candidates examinations and he remained at the university to prepare for a lecturers position
in april markov defended his masters thesis on the binary square forms with positive determinant which was directed by aleksandr korkin and yegor zolotarev
four years later in he defended his doctoral thesis titled on certain applications of the algebraic continuous fractions
his pedagogical work began after the defense of his masters thesis in autumn
as a privatdozent he lectured on differential and integral calculus
later he lectured alternately on introduction to analysis probability theory and the calculus of differences
from through he also lectured in differential calculus
one year after the defense of his doctoral thesis markov was appointed extraordinary professor and in the same year he was elected adjunct to the academy of sciences
in after the death of viktor bunyakovsky markov became an extraordinary member of the academy
his promotion to an ordinary professor of st
petersburg university followed in the fall of
in markov was elected an ordinary member of the academy as the successor of chebyshev
in he was appointed merited professor and was granted the right to retire which he did immediately
until however he continued to lecture in the calculus of differences
in connection with student riots in professors and lecturers of st
petersburg university were ordered to monitor their students
markov refused to accept this decree and he wrote an explanation in which he declined to be an agent of the governance
markov was removed from further teaching duties at st
petersburg university and hence he decided to retire from the university
markov was an atheist
in he responded to leo tolstoys excommunication from the russian orthodox church by requesting his own excommunication
the church complied with his request
in the council of st
petersburg elected nine scientists honorary members of the university
markov was among them but his election was not affirmed by the minister of education
the affirmation only occurred four years later after the february revolution in
markov then resumed his teaching activities and lectured on probability theory and the calculus of differences until his death in
angst is fear or anxiety
the dictionary definition for angst is a feeling of anxiety apprehension or insecurity
the word angst was introduced into english from the danish norwegian and dutch word and the german word
it is attested since the th century in english translations of the works of sren kierkegaard and sigmund freud
it is used in english to describe an intense feeling of apprehension anxiety or inner turmoil
in other languages the derived words differ in meaning for example as in the french and
the word angst has existed in german since the th century from the proto indo european root restraint from which old high german developed
it is pre cognate with the latin tensity tightness and choking clogging compare to the ancient greek strangle
it entered english in the th century as a technical term used in psychiatry though earlier cognates existed such as
in existentialist philosophy the term angst carries a specific conceptual meaning
the use of the term was first attributed to danish philosopher sren kierkegaard
in the concept of anxiety kierkegaard used the word angest to describe a profound and deep seated condition
where non human animals are guided solely by instinct said kierkegaard human beings enjoy a freedom of choice that we find both appealing and terrifying
it is the anxiety of understanding of being free when considering undefined possibilities of ones life and the immense responsibility of having the power of choice over them
kierkegaards concept of angst reappeared in the works of existentialist philosophers who followed such as friedrich nietzsche jean paul sartre and martin heidegger each of whom developed the idea further in individual ways
while kierkegaards angst referred mainly to ambiguous feelings about moral freedom within a religious personal belief system later existentialists discussed conflicts of personal principles cultural norms and existential despair
existential angst makes its appearance in classical musical composition in the early twentieth century as a result of both philosophical developments and as a reflection of the war torn times
notable composers whose works are often linked with the concept include gustav mahler richard strauss claude debussy jean sibelius arnold schoenberg alban berg francis poulenc dmitri shostakovich bla bartk and krzysztof penderecki
angst began to be discussed in reference to popular music in the mid to late s amid widespread concerns over international tensions and nuclear proliferation
jeff nuttalls book bomb culture traced angst in popular culture to hiroshima
dread was expressed in works of folk rock such as bob dylans masters of war and a hard rains a gonna fall
the term often makes an appearance in reference to punk rock grunge nu metal and works of emo where expressions of melancholy existential despair or nihilism predominate
anxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events
anxiety is different from fear in that fear is defined as the emotional response to a real threat whereas anxiety is the anticipation of a future threat
it is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth somatic complaints and rumination
anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing
it is often accompanied by muscular tension restlessness fatigue inability to catch ones breath tightness in the abdominal region nausea and problems in concentration
anxiety is closely related to fear which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat anxiety involves the expectation of future threat including dread
people facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past
the emotion of anxiety can persist beyond the developmentally appropriate time periods in response to specific events and thus turning into one of the multiple anxiety disorders
the difference between anxiety disorder and anxiety is that people with an anxiety disorder experience anxiety most of the days during approximately months or even during shorter time periods in children
anxiety disorders are among the most persistent mental problems and often last decades
besides strong percepts of anxiety exist within other mental disorders eg obsessive compulsive disorder post traumatic stress disorder
anxiety is distinguished from fear which is an appropriate cognitive and emotional response to a perceived threat
anxiety is related to the specific behaviors of fight or flight responses defensive behavior or escape
there is a false presumption that often circulates that anxiety only occurs in situations perceived as uncontrollable or unavoidable but this is not always so
david barlow defines anxiety as a future oriented mood state in which one is not ready or prepared to attempt to cope with upcoming negative events and that it is a distinction between future and present dangers which divides anxiety and fear
another description of anxiety is agony dread terror or even apprehension
in positive psychology anxiety is described as the mental state that results from a difficult challenge for which the subject has insufficient coping skills
fear and anxiety can be differentiated into four domains duration of emotional experience temporal focus specificity of the threat and motivated direction
fear is short lived present focused geared towards a specific threat and facilitating escape from threat
on the other hand anxiety is long acting future focused broadly focused towards a diffuse threat and promoting excessive caution while approaching a potential threat and interferes with constructive coping
joseph e
ledoux and lisa feldman barrett have both sought to separate automatic threat responses from additional associated cognitive activity within anxiety
anxiety can be experienced with long drawn out daily symptoms that reduce quality of life known as chronic anxiety or it can be experienced in short spurts with sporadic stressful panic attacks known as acute anxiety
symptoms of anxiety can range in number intensity and frequency depending on the person
however most people do not suffer from chronic anxiety
anxiety can induce several psychological pains or mental disorders and may lead to self harm or suicide
the behavioral effects of anxiety may include withdrawal from situations which have provoked anxiety or negative feelings in the past
other effects may include changes in sleeping patterns changes in habits increase or decrease in food intake and increased motor tension
the emotional effects of anxiety may include feelings of apprehension or dread trouble concentrating feeling tense or jumpy anticipating the worst irritability restlessness watching for signs of danger and feeling like your minds gone blank as well as nightmares bad dreams obsessions about sensations dj vu a trapped in your mind feeling and feeling like everything is scary
it may include a vague experience and feeling of helplessness
the cognitive effects of anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers such as fear of dying you may
fear that the chest pains are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head are the result of a tumor or an aneurysm
you feel an intense fear when you think of dying or you may think of it more often than normal or cant get it out of your mind
there are various types of anxiety
existential anxiety can occur when a person faces angst an existential crisis or nihilistic feelings
people can also face mathematical anxiety somatic anxiety stage fright or test anxiety
social anxiety refers to a fear of rejection and negative evaluation by other people
the philosopher sren kierkegaard in the concept of anxiety described anxiety or dread associated with the dizziness of freedom and suggested the possibility for positive resolution of anxiety through the self conscious exercise of responsibility and choosing
in art and artist the psychologist otto rank wrote that the psychological trauma of birth was the pre eminent human symbol of existential anxiety and encompasses the creative persons simultaneous fear of and desire for separation individuation and differentiation
the theologian paul tillich characterized existential anxiety as the state in which a being is aware of its possible nonbeing and he listed three categories for the nonbeing and resulting anxiety ontic moral and spiritual
according to tillich the last of these three types of existential anxiety ie spiritual anxiety is predominant in modern times while the others were predominant in earlier periods
tillich argues that this anxiety can be accepted as part of the human condition or it can be resisted but with negative consequences
in its pathological form spiritual anxiety may tend to drive the person toward the creation of certitude in systems of meaning which are supported by tradition and authority even though such undoubted certitude is not built on the rock of reality
according to viktor frankl the author of mans search for meaning when a person is faced with extreme mortal dangers the most basic of all human wishes is to find a meaning of life to combat the trauma of nonbeing as death is near
according to yerkes dodson law an optimal level of arousal is necessary to best complete a task such as an exam performance or competitive event
however when the anxiety or level of arousal exceeds that optimum the result is a decline in performance
test anxiety is the uneasiness apprehension or nervousness felt by students who have a fear of failing an exam
students who have test anxiety may experience any of the following the association of grades with personal worth fear of embarrassment by a teacher fear of alienation from parents or friends time pressures or feeling a loss of control
sweating dizziness headaches racing heartbeats nausea fidgeting uncontrollable crying or laughing and drumming on a desk are all common
because test anxiety hinges on fear of negative evaluation debate exists as to whether test anxiety is itself a unique anxiety disorder or whether it is a specific type of social phobia
the dsm iv classifies test anxiety as a type of social phobia
test anxiety remains a challenge for students regardless of age and has considerable physiological and psychological impacts
management of test anxiety focuses on achieving relaxation and developing mechanisms to manage anxiety
the routine practice of slow device guided breathing is a major component of behavioral treatments for anxiety conditions
performance anxiety and competitive anxiety happen when an individuals performance is measured against others
an important distinction between competitive and non competitive anxiety is that competitive anxiety makes people view their performance as a threat
as a result they experience a drop in their ordinary ability whether physical or mental due to that perceived stress
competitive anxiety is caused by a range of internal factors including high expectations outside pressure lack of experience and external factors like the location of a competition
it commonly occurs in those participating in high pressure activities like sports and debates
some common symptoms of competitive anxiety include muscle tension fatigue weakness sense of panic apprehensiveness and panic attacks
there are major theories of how anxiety affects performance drive theory inverted u theory reversal theory and the zone of optimal functioning theory
drive theory believes that anxiety is positive and performance improves proportionally to the level of anxiety
this theory is not well accepted
the inverted u theory is based on the idea that performance peaks at a moderate stress level
it is called inverted u theory because the graph that plots performance against anxiety looks like an inverted u
reversal theory suggests that performance increases in relation to the individuals interpretation of their arousal levels
if they believed their physical arousal level would help them their performance would increase if they didnt their performance would decrease
for example athletes were shown to worry more when focusing on results and perfection rather than the effort and growth involved
the zone of optimal functioning theory proposes that there is a zone where positive and negative emotions are in a balance which lead to feelings of dissociation and intense concentration optimizing the individuals performance levels
humans generally require social acceptance and thus sometimes dread the disapproval of others
apprehension of being judged by others may cause anxiety in social environments
anxiety during social interactions particularly between strangers is common among young people
it may persist into adulthood and become social anxiety or social phobia
stranger anxiety in small children is not considered a phobia
in adults an excessive fear of other people is not a developmentally common stage it is called social anxiety
according to cutting social phobics do not fear the crowd but the fact that they may be judged negatively
social anxiety varies in degree and severity
for some people it is characterized by experiencing discomfort or awkwardness during physical social contact while in other cases it can lead to a fear of interacting with unfamiliar people altogether
those with this condition may restrict their lifestyles to accommodate the anxiety minimizing social interaction whenever possible
social anxiety also forms a core aspect of certain personality disorders including avoidant personality disorder
to the extent that a person is fearful of social encounters with unfamiliar others some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members or people who share different group memberships
depending on the nature of the antecedent relations cognitions and situational factors intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety
this apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety
as is the case with the more generalized forms of social anxiety intergroup anxiety has behavioral cognitive and affective effects
for instance increases in schematic processing and simplified information processing can occur when anxiety is high
indeed such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in implicit memory
additionally recent research has found that implicit racial evaluations can be amplified during intergroup interaction
negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations but also avoidant or antagonistic behavior such as hostility
furthermore when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort in intragroup contexts levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation
anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term personality trait
trait anxiety reflects a stable tendency across the lifespan of responding with acute state anxiety in the anticipation of threatening situations
a meta analysis showed that a high level of neuroticism is a risk factor for development of anxiety symptoms and disorders
such anxiety may be conscious or unconscious
personality can also be a trait leading to anxiety and depression and their persistence
through experience many find it difficult to collect themselves due to their own personal nature
anxiety induced by the need to choose between similar options is increasingly being recognized as a problem for individuals and for organizations
in capgemini wrote today were all faced with greater choice more competition and less time to consider our options or seek out the right advice
in a decision context unpredictability or uncertainty may trigger emotional responses in anxious individuals that systematically alter decision making
there are primarily two forms of this anxiety type
the first form refers to a choice in which there are multiple potential outcomes with known or calculable probabilities
the second form refers to the uncertainty and ambiguity related to a decision context in which there are multiple possible outcomes with unknown probabilities
panic disorder may share symptoms of stress and anxiety but it is actually very different
panic disorder is an anxiety disorder that occurs without any triggers
according to the us department of health and human services this disorder can be distinguished by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear
someone with panic disorder will eventually develop constant fear of another attack and as this progresses it will begin to affect daily functioning and an individuals general quality of life
it is reported by the cleveland clinic that panic disorder affects to percent of adult americans and can begin around the time of the teenage and early adult years
some symptoms include difficulty breathing chest pain dizziness trembling or shaking feeling faint nausea fear that you are losing control or are about to die
even though they have these symptoms during an attack the main symptom is the persistent fear of having future panic attacks
anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by exaggerated feelings of anxiety and fear responses
anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events
these feelings may cause physical symptoms such as a fast heart rate and shakiness
there are a number of anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety disorder specific phobia social anxiety disorder separation anxiety disorder agoraphobia panic disorder and selective mutism
the disorder differs by what results in the symptoms
people often have more than one anxiety disorder
anxiety disorders are caused by a complex combination of genetic and environmental factors
to be diagnosed symptoms typically need to be present for at least six months be more than would be expected for the situation and decrease a persons ability to function in their daily lives
other problems that may result in similar symptoms include hyperthyroidism heart disease caffeine alcohol or cannabis use and withdrawal from certain drugs among others
without treatment anxiety disorders tend to remain
treatment may include lifestyle changes counselling and medications
counselling is typically with a type of cognitive behavioural therapy
medications such as antidepressants or beta blockers may improve symptoms
about of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a given year and between are affected at some point in their life
they occur about twice as often in women than they do in men and generally begin before the age of
the most common are specific phobia which affects nearly and social anxiety disorder which affects at some point in their life
they affect those between the ages of and the most and become less common after the age of
rates appear to be higher in the united states and europe
anxiety can be either a short term state or a long term trait
whereas trait anxiety represents worrying about future events anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fears
anxiety disorders often occur with other mental health disorders particularly major depressive disorder bipolar disorder eating disorders or certain personality disorders
it also commonly occurs with personality traits such as neuroticism
this observed co occurrence is partly due to genetic and environmental influences shared between these traits and anxiety
it is common for those with obsessive compulsive disorder to experience anxiety
anxiety is also commonly found in those who experience panic disorders phobic anxiety disorders severe stress dissociative disorders somatoform disorders and some neurotic disorders
anxiety has also been linked to the experience of intrusive thoughts
studies have revealed that individuals who experience high levels of anxiety are highly vulnerable to the experience of intense intrusive thoughts or psychological disorders that are characterised by intrusive thoughts
anxiety disorders are partly genetic with twin studies suggesting genetic influence on individual differences in anxiety
environmental factors are also important
twin studies show that individual specific environments have a large influence on anxiety whereas shared environmental influences operate during childhood but decline through adolescence
specific measured environments that have been associated with anxiety include child abuse family history of mental health disorders and poverty
anxiety is also associated with drug use including alcohol caffeine and benzodiazepines
neural circuitry involving the amygdala and hippocampus is thought to underlie anxiety
people who have anxiety tend to show high activity in response to emotional stimuli in the amygdala
some writers believe that excessive anxiety can lead to an overpotentiation of the limbic system giving increased future anxiety but this does not appear to have been proven
research upon adolescents who as infants had been highly apprehensive vigilant and fearful finds that their nucleus accumbens is more sensitive than that in other people when deciding to make an action that determined whether they received a reward
this suggests a link between circuits responsible for fear and also reward in anxious people
as researchers note a sense of responsibility or self agency in a context of uncertainty drives the neural system underlying appetitive motivation more strongly in temperamentally inhibited than noninhibited adolescents
the microbes of the gut can connect with the brain to affect anxiety
there are various pathways along which this communication can take place
one is through the major neurotransmitters
the gut microbes such as bifidobacterium and bacillus produce the neurotransmitters gaba and dopamine respectively
the neurotransmitters signal to the nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract and those signals will be carried to the brain through the vagus nerve or the spinal system
this is demonstrated by the fact that altering the microbiome has shown anxiety and depression reducing effects in mice but not in subjects without vagus nerves
another key pathway is the hpa axis as mentioned above
the microbes can control the levels of cytokines in the body and altering cytokine levels creates direct effects on areas of the brain such as the hypothalamus the area that triggers hpa axis activity
the hpa axis regulates production of cortisol a hormone that takes part in the bodys stress response
when hpa activity spikes cortisol levels increase processing and reducing anxiety in stressful situations
these pathways as well as the specific effects of individual taxa of microbes are not yet completely clear but the communication between the gut microbiome and the brain is undeniable as is the ability of these pathways to alter anxiety levels
with this communication comes the potential to treat anxiety
prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to reduce anxiety
for example experiments in which mice were given fructo and galacto oligosaccharide prebiotics and lactobacillus probiotics have both demonstrated a capability to reduce anxiety
in humans results are not as concrete but promising
genetics and family history may put an individual at increased risk of an anxiety disorder but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation
estimates of genetic influence on anxiety based on studies of twins range from to depending on the specific type and age group under study
for example genetic differences account for about of variance in panic disorder and in generalized anxiety disorder
longitudinal twin studies have shown the moderate stability of anxiety from childhood through to adulthood is mainly influenced by stability in genetic influence
when investigating how anxiety is passed on from parents to children it is important to account for sharing of genes as well as environments for example using the intergenerational children of twins design
many studies in the past used a candidate gene approach to test whether single genes were associated with anxiety
these investigations were based on hypotheses about how certain known genes influence neurotransmitters and hormones that are implicated in anxiety
none of these findings are well replicated with the possible exception of tmemd comt and mao a
the epigenetic signature of bdnf a gene that codes for a protein called brain derived neurotrophic factor that is found in the brain has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity
and a receptor gene for bdnf called ntrk was associated with anxiety in a large genome wide investigation
the reason that most candidate gene findings have not replicated is that anxiety is a complex trait that is influenced by many genomic variants each of which has a small effect on its own
increasingly studies of anxiety are using a hypothesis free approach to look for parts of the genome that are implicated in anxiety using big enough samples to find associations with variants that have small effects
the largest explorations of the common genetic architecture of anxiety have been facilitated by the uk biobank the angst consortium and the crc fear anxiety and anxiety disorders
many medical conditions can cause anxiety
this includes conditions that affect the ability to breathe like copd and asthma and the difficulty in breathing that often occurs near death
conditions that cause abdominal pain or chest pain can cause anxiety and may in some cases be a somatization of anxiety the same is true for some sexual dysfunctions
conditions that affect the face or the skin can cause social anxiety especially among adolescents and developmental disabilities often lead to social anxiety for children as well
life threatening conditions like cancer also cause anxiety
furthermore certain organic diseases may present with anxiety or symptoms that mimic anxiety
these disorders include certain endocrine diseases metabolic disorders deficiency states gastrointestinal diseases heart diseases blood diseases cerebral vascular accidents and brain degenerative diseases among others
several drugs can cause or worsen anxiety whether in intoxication withdrawal or as side effect
these include alcohol tobacco sedatives opioids stimulants hallucinogens and inhalants
while many often report self medicating anxiety with these substances improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short lived and tend to be exaggerated
acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria anxiety and irritability lasting up to weeks after the exposure
poor coping skills are associated with anxiety
anxiety is also linked and perpetuated by the persons own pessimistic outcome expectancy and how they cope with feedback negativity
temperament and attitudes have been found to be risk factors for anxiety
cognitive distortions such as overgeneralizing catastrophizing mind reading emotional reasoning binocular trick and mental filter can result in anxiety
for example an overgeneralized belief that something bad always happens may lead someone to have excessive fears of even minimally risky situations and to avoid benign social situations due to anticipatory anxiety of embarrassment
in addition those who have high anxiety can also create future stressful life events
together these findings suggest that anxious thoughts can lead to anticipatory anxiety as well as stressful events which in turn cause more anxiety
such unhealthy thoughts can be targets for successful treatment with cognitive therapy
psychodynamic theory posits that anxiety is often the result of opposing unconscious wishes or fears that manifest via maladaptive defense mechanisms that develop to adapt to problems with early objects and empathic failures in childhood
for example persistent parental discouragement of anger may result in repression suppression of angry feelings which manifests as gastrointestinal distress when provoked by another while the anger remains unconscious and outside the individuals awareness
such conflicts can be targets for successful treatment with psychodynamic therapy
while psychodynamic therapy tends to explore the underlying roots of anxiety cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to be a successful treatment for anxiety by altering irrational thoughts and unwanted behaviors
an evolutionary psychology explanation is that increased anxiety serves the purpose of increased vigilance regarding potential threats in the environment as well as increased tendency to take proactive actions regarding such possible threats
this may cause false positive reactions but an individual with anxiety may also avoid real threats
this may explain why anxious people are less likely to die due to accidents
there is ample empirical evidence that anxiety can have adaptive value
within a school timid fish are more likely than bold fish to survive a predator
when people are confronted with unpleasant and potentially harmful stimuli such as foul odors or tastes pet scans show increased blood flow in the amygdala
in these studies the participants also reported moderate anxiety
this might indicate that anxiety is a protective mechanism designed to prevent the organism from engaging in potentially harmful behaviors
social risk factors for anxiety include a history of trauma bullying early life experiences and parenting factors cultural factors and socioeconomics
a comprehensive systematic review of over studies showed that food insecurity in the united states is strongly associated with depression anxiety and sleep disorders
food insecure individuals had an almost fold risk increase of testing positive for anxiety when compared to food secure individuals
contextual factors that are thought to contribute to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences
in particular learning mastery and instrumentality which includes such traits as self confidence self efficacy independence and competitiveness fully mediate the relation between gender and anxiety
that is though gender differences in anxiety exist with higher levels of anxiety in women compared to men gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences
the first step in the management of a person with anxiety symptoms involves evaluating the possible presence of an underlying medical cause the recognition of which is essential in order to decide the correct treatment
anxiety symptoms may mask an organic disease or appear associated with or as a result of a medical disorder
cognitive behavioral therapy is effective for anxiety disorders and is a first line treatment
cbt appears to be equally effective when carried out via the internet
while evidence for mental health apps is promising it is preliminary
psychopharmacological treatment can be used in parallel to cbt or can be used alone
as a general rule most anxiety disorders respond well to first line agents
such drugs also used as anti depressants are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors that work by blocking the reuptake of specific neurotransmitters and resulting in the increase in availability of these neurotransmitters
additionally benzodiazepines are often prescribed to individuals with anxiety disorder
benzodiazepines produce an anxiolytic response by modulating gaba and increasing its receptor binding
a third common treatment involves a category of drug known as serotonin agonists
this category of drug works by initiating a physiological response at hta receptor by increasing the action of serotonin at this receptor
other treatment options include pregabalin tricyclic antidepressants and moclobemide among others
anxiety is considered to be a serious psychiatric illness that has an unknown true pervasiveness due to affected individuals not asking for proper treatment or aid and due to professionals missing the diagnosis
the above risk factors give natural avenues for prevention
a review found that psychological or educational interventions have a small yet statistically significant benefit for the prevention of anxiety in varied population types
anxiety disorder appears to be a genetically inherited neurochemical dysfunction that may involve autonomic imbalance decreased gaba ergic tone allelic polymorphism of the catechol o methyltransferase gene increased adenosine receptor function increased cortisol
in the central nervous system the major mediators of the symptoms of anxiety disorders appear to be norepinephrine serotonin dopamine and gamma aminobutyric acid
other neurotransmitters and peptides such as corticotropin releasing factor may be involved
peripherally the autonomic nervous system especially the sympathetic nervous system mediates many of the symptoms
increased flow in the right parahippocampal region and reduced serotonin type a receptor binding in the anterior and posterior cingulate and raphe of patients are the diagnostic factors for prevalence of anxiety disorder
the amygdala is central to the processing of fear and anxiety and its function may be disrupted in anxiety disorders
anxiety processing in the basolateral amygdala has been implicated with expansion of dendritic arborization of the amygdaloid neurons
sk potassium channels mediate inhibitory influence on action potentials and reduce arborization
alan alexander milne was an english writer best known for his books about the teddy bear winnie the pooh as well as for childrens poetry
milne was primarily a playwright before the huge success of winnie the pooh overshadowed all his previous work
milne served in both world wars as a lieutenant in the royal warwickshire regiment in the first world war and as a captain in the home guard in the second world war
milne was the father of bookseller christopher robin milne upon whom the character christopher robin is based
it was during a visit to london zoo where christopher became enamoured with the tame and amiable bear winnipeg that milne was inspired to write the story of winnie the pooh for his son
milne bequeathed the original manuscripts of the winnie the pooh stories to the wren library at trinity college cambridge his alma mater
alan alexander milne was born in kilburn london to john vine milne who was born in jamaica and sarah marie milne on january

milne joined the british army in world war i and served as an officer in the royal warwickshire regiment
he was commissioned into the th battalion royal warwickshire regiment on february as a second lieutenant
his commission was confirmed on december
he served on the somme as a signals officer from july november but caught trench fever and was invalided back to england
having recuperated he worked as a signals instructor before being recruited into military intelligence to write propaganda articles for mi between and
he was discharged on february and settled in mallord street chelsea
he relinquished his commission on february retaining the rank of lieutenant
after the war he wrote a denunciation of war titled peace with honour which he retracted somewhat with s war with honour
during world war ii milne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow english writer p
wodehouse who was captured at his country home in france by the nazis and imprisoned for a year
wodehouse made radio broadcasts about his internment which were broadcast from berlin
although the light hearted broadcasts made fun of the germans milne accused wodehouse of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his countrys enemy
wodehouse got some revenge on his former friend by creating fatuous parodies of the christopher robin poems in some of his later stories and claiming that milne was probably jealous of all other writers
but i loved his stuff
milne married dorothy daphne de slincourt in and their son christopher robin milne was born in
in milne bought a country home cotchford farm in hartfield east sussex
during world war ii milne was a captain in the british home guard in hartfield forest row insisting on being plain mr milne to the members of his platoon
he retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in left him an invalid and by august he seemed very old and disenchanted
milne died in january aged
after graduating from cambridge university in a
milne contributed humorous verse and whimsical essays to punch joining the staff in and becoming an assistant editor
during this period he published plays and three novels including the murder mystery the red house mystery
his son was born in august and in milne produced a collection of childrens poems when we were very young which were illustrated by punch staff cartoonist e
a collection of short stories for children a gallery of children and other stories that became part of the winnie the pooh books were first published in
milne was an early screenwriter for the nascent british film industry writing four stories filmed in for the company minerva films
these were the bump starring aubrey smith twice two five pound reward and bookworms
some of these films survive in the archives of the british film institute
milne had met howard when the actor starred in milnes play mr pim passes by in london
looking back on this period milne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story he was told that what the country wanted from a punch humorist was a humorous story when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story and after another two years he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for childrens books
he concluded that the only excuse which i have yet discovered for writing anything is that i want to write it and i should be as proud to be delivered of a telephone directory con amore as i should be ashamed to create a blank verse tragedy at the bidding of others
milne is most famous for his two pooh books about a boy named christopher robin after his son christopher robin milne and various characters inspired by his sons stuffed animals most notably the bear named winnie the pooh
christopher robin milnes stuffed bear originally named edward was renamed winnie after a canadian black bear named winnie which was used as a military mascot in world war i and left to london zoo during the war
the pooh comes from a swan the young milne named pooh
shepard illustrated the original pooh books using his own sons teddy growler as the model
the rest of christopher robin milnes toys piglet eeyore kanga roo and tigger were incorporated into a
milnes stories and two more characters rabbit and owl were created by milnes imagination
christopher robin milnes own toys are now on display in new york where people visit them every year
the fictional hundred acre wood of the pooh stories derives from five hundred acre wood in ashdown forest in east sussex south east england where the pooh stories were set
milne lived on the northern edge of the forest at cotchford farm and took his son walking there
shepard drew on the landscapes of ashdown forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the pooh books
the adult christopher robin commented poohs forest and ashdown forest are identical
popular tourist locations at ashdown forest include galleons lap the enchanted place the heffalump trap and lone pine eeyores sad and gloomy place and the wooden pooh bridge where pooh and piglet invented poohsticks
not yet known as pooh he made his first appearance in a poem teddy bear published in punch magazine in february and republished that year in when we were very young
pooh first appeared in the london evening news on christmas eve in a story called the wrong sort of bees
winnie the pooh was published in followed by the house at pooh corner in
a second collection of nursery rhymes now we are six was published in
all four books were illustrated by e
milne also published four plays in this period
he also gallantly stepped forward to contribute a quarter of the costs of dramatising p

the world of pooh won the lewis carroll shelf award in
the success of his childrens books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to milne whose self avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had until then found a ready audience for each change of direction he had freed pre war punch from its ponderous facetiousness he had made a considerable reputation as a playwright on both sides of the atlantic he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in the red house mystery
but once milne had in his own words said goodbye to all that in words he had no intention of producing any reworkings lacking in originality given that one of the sources of inspiration his son was growing older
another reason milne stopped writing childrens books and especially about winnie the pooh was that he felt amazement and disgust over the immense fame his son was exposed to and said that i feel that the legal christopher robin has already had more publicity than i want for him
i do not want cr milne to ever wish that his name were charles robert
in his literary home punch where the when we were very young verses had first appeared methuen continued to publish whatever milne wrote including the long poem the norman church and an assembly of articles entitled year in year out
in milne adapted kenneth grahames novel the wind in the willows for the stage as toad of toad hall
the title was an implicit admission that such chapters as chapter the piper at the gates of dawn could not survive translation to the theatre
a special introduction written by milne is included in some editions of grahames novel
milne and his wife became estranged from their son who came to resent what he saw as his fathers exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye
christophers marriage to his first cousin lesley de slincourt distanced him still further from his parents lesleys father and christophers mother had not spoken to each other for years
milne died at his home in hartfield sussex on january nearly two weeks after his th birthday
a memorial service took place on february at all hallows by the tower church in london
the rights to a
milnes pooh books were left to four beneficiaries his family the royal literary fund westminster school and the garrick club
after milnes death in thirteen days after his th birthday his widow sold her rights to the pooh characters to stephen slesinger whose widow sold the rights after slesingers death to the walt disney company which has made many pooh cartoon movies a disney channel television show as well as pooh related merchandise

asociacin alumni usually just alumni is an argentine rugby union club located in tortuguitas greater buenos aires
the senior squad currently competes at top the first division of the unin de rugby de buenos aires league system
the club has ties with former football club alumni because both were established by buenos aires english high school students
the first club with the name alumni played association football having been found in by students of buenos aires english high school along with director alexander watson hutton
originally under the name english high school ac the team would be later obliged by the association to change its name therefore alumni was chosen following a proposal by carlos bowers a former student of the school
alumni was the most successful team during the first years of argentine football winning of league championships contested
alumni is still considered the first great football team in the country
alumni was reorganised in in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports specially football
this was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team such as lomas belgrano and quilmes had successfully done in the past but the efforts were not enough
alumni played its last game in and was definitely dissolved on april
in two guards of the baehs daniel ginhson and guillermo cubelli supported by the schools alumni and fathers of the students they decided to establish a club focused on rugby union exclusively
former players still alive of alumni football club and descendants of other players already dead gave their permission to use the name alumni
on december in a meeting presided by carlos bowers himself the club was officially established under the name asociacin juvenil alumni also adopting the same colors as its predecessor
the team achieved good results and in the club presented a team that won the third division of the buenos aires league reaching the second division
since then alumni has played at the highest level of argentine rugby and its rivalry with belgrano athletic club is one of the fiercest local derbies in buenos aires
alumni would later climb up to first division winning titles consecutive between and and the other in
in alumni won its first nacional de clubes title defeating jockey club de rosario in the final
an axiom postulate or assumption is a statement that is taken to be true to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments
the word comes from the ancient greek word meaning that which is thought worthy or fit or that which commends itself as evident
the precise definition varies across fields of study
in classic philosophy an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well established that it is accepted without controversy or question
in modern logic an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning
in mathematics an axiom may be a logical axiom or a non logical axiom
logical axioms are taken to be true within the system of logic they define and are often shown in symbolic form implies a while non logical axioms are substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theory such as arithmetic
non logical axioms may also be called postulates or assumptions
in most cases a non logical axiom is simply a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory and might or might not be self evident in nature
to axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small well understood set of sentences and there are typically many ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain
any axiom is a statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived
whether it is meaningful for an axiom to be true is a subject of debate in the philosophy of mathematics
the word axiom comes from the greek word a verbal noun from the verb meaning to deem worthy but also to require which in turn comes from meaning being in balance and hence having value worthy proper
among the ancient greek philosophers an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be self evidently true without any need for proof
the root meaning of the word postulate is to demand for instance euclid demands that one agree that some things can be done
ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates
while commenting on euclids books proclus remarks that geminus held that this postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom since it does not like the first three postulates assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property
boethius translated postulate as petitio and called the axioms notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept
the logico deductive method whereby conclusions follow from premises through the application of sound arguments was developed by the ancient greeks and has become the core principle of modern mathematics
tautologies excluded nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed
axioms and postulates are thus the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge
they are accepted without demonstration
all other assertions must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions
however the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician than they did for aristotle and euclid
the ancient greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts
as such they developed and used the logico deductive method as a means of avoiding error and for structuring and communicating knowledge
aristotles posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view
an axiom in classical terminology referred to a self evident assumption common to many branches of science
a good example would be the assertion that when an equal amount is taken from equals an equal amount results
at the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses that were accepted without proof
such a hypothesis was termed a postulate
while the axioms were common to many sciences the postulates of each particular science were different
their validity had to be established by means of real world experience
aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates
the classical approach is well illustrated by euclids elements where a list of postulates is given followed by a list of common notions
a lesson learned by mathematics in the last years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions and definitions
one must concede the need for primitive notions or undefined terms or concepts in any study
such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general capable of multiple different meanings and therefore useful in multiple contexts
alessandro padoa mario pieri and giuseppe peano were pioneers in this movement
structuralist mathematics goes further and develops theories and axioms without any particular application in mind
the distinction between an axiom and a postulate disappears
the postulates of euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts
the truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses
however by throwing out euclids fifth postulate one can get theories that have meaning in wider contexts
as such one must simply be prepared to use labels such as line and parallel with greater flexibility
the development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that it is useful to regard postulates as purely formal statements and not as facts based on experience
when mathematicians employ the field axioms the intentions are even more abstract
the propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application the mathematician now works in complete abstraction
there are many examples of fields field theory gives correct knowledge about them all
it is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are propositions that are regarded as true without proof
rather the field axioms are a set of constraints
if any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system
modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects and mathematics itself can be regarded as a branch of logic
frege russell poincar hilbert and gdel are some of the key figures in this development
another lesson learned in modern mathematics is to examine purported proofs carefully for hidden assumptions
in the modern understanding a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well defined rules
in this view logic becomes just another formal system
a set of axioms should be consistent it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axioms
a set of axioms should also be non redundant an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom
it was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics perhaps all of mathematics could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms
an early success of the formalist program was hilberts formalization of euclidean geometry and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms
in a wider context there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on cantors set theory
here the emergence of russells paradox and similar antinomies of nave set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent
the formalist project suffered a decisive setback when in gdel showed that it is possible for any sufficiently large set of axioms to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms
as a corollary gdel proved that the consistency of a theory like peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory
it is reasonable to believe in the consistency of peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system
however at present there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern zermelo fraenkel axioms for set theory
furthermore using techniques of forcing one can show that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the zermelo fraenkel axioms
thus even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics
experimental sciences as opposed to mathematics and logic also have general founding assertions from which a deductive reasoning can be built so as to express propositions that predict properties either still general or much more specialized to a specific experimental context
for instance newtons laws in classical mechanics maxwells equations in classical electromagnetism einsteins equation in general relativity mendels laws of genetics darwins natural selection law etc
these founding assertions are usually called principles or postulates so as to distinguish from mathematical axioms
as a matter of facts the role of axioms in mathematics and postulates in experimental sciences is different
in mathematics one neither proves nor disproves an axiom
a set of mathematical axioms gives a set of rules that fix a conceptual realm in which the theorems logically follow
in contrast in experimental sciences a set of postulates shall allow deducing results that match or do not match experimental results
if postulates do not allow deducing experimental predictions they do not set a scientific conceptual framework and have to be completed or made more accurate
if the postulates allow deducing predictions of experimental results the comparison with experiments allows falsifying the theory that the postulates install
a theory is considered valid as long as it has not been falsified
now the transition between the mathematical axioms and scientific postulates is always slightly blurred especially in physics
this is due to the heavy use of mathematical tools to support the physical theories
for instance the introduction of newtons laws rarely establishes as a prerequisite neither euclidian geometry or differential calculus that they imply
it became more apparent when albert einstein first introduced special relativity where the invariant quantity is no more the euclidian length formula but the minkowski spacetime interval formula and then general relativity where flat minkowskian geometry is replaced with pseudo riemannian geometry on curved manifolds
in quantum physics two sets of postulates have coexisted for some time which provide a very nice example of falsification
the copenhagen school developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical formalism that involves the description of quantum system by vectors in a separable hilbert space and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this hilbert space
this approach is fully falsifiable and has so far produced the most accurate predictions in physics
but it has the unsatisfactory aspect of not allowing answers to questions one would naturally ask
for this reason another hidden variables approach was developed for some time by albert einstein erwin schrdinger david bohm
it was created so as to try to give deterministic explanation to phenomena such as entanglement
this approach assumed that the copenhagen school description was not complete and postulated that some yet unknown variable was to be added to the theory so as to allow answering some of the questions it does not answer
taking this ideas seriously john bell derived in a prediction that would lead to different experimental results in the copenhagen and the hidden variable case
the experiment was conducted first by alain aspect in the early s and the result excluded the simple hidden variable approach
this does not mean that the conceptual framework of quantum physics can be considered as complete now since some open questions still exist
in the field of mathematical logic a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms logical and non logical
these are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid that is formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values
usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense
each of these patterns is an axiom schema a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms
for example if formula formula and formula are propositional variables then formula and formula are both instances of axiom schema and hence are axioms
it can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and modus ponens one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus
it can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens
other axiom schemata involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed
these axiom schemata are also used in the predicate calculus but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus
axiom of equalitylet formula be a first order language
for each variable formula the below formula is universally valid
formula this means that for any variable symbol formula the formula formula can be regarded as an axiom
also in this example for this not to fall into vagueness and a never ending series of primitive notions either a precise notion of what we mean by formula has to be well established first or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol formula has to be enforced only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols and mathematical logic does indeed do that
axiom scheme for universal instantiationgiven a formula formula in a first order language formula a variable formula and a term formula that is substitutable for formula in formula the below formula is universally valid
formula where the symbol formula stands for the formula formula with the term formula substituted for formula
in informal terms this example allows us to state that if we know that a certain property formula holds for every formula and that formula stands for a particular object in our structure then we should be able to claim formula
again we are claiming that the formula formula is valid that is we must be able to give a proof of this fact or more properly speaking a metaproof
these examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself
aside from this we can also have existential generalization axiom scheme for existential generalization
given a formula formula in a first order language formula a variable formula and a term formula that is substitutable for formula in formula the below formula is universally valid
formula non logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory specific assumptions
reasoning about two different structures for example the natural numbers and the integers may involve the same logical axioms the non logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure
thus non logical axioms unlike logical axioms are not tautologies
another name for a non logical axiom is postulate
almost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non logical axioms and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas
non logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse
this does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense
for example in some groups the group operation is commutative and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom but without this axiom we can do quite well developing group theory and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non commutative groups
thus an axiom is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system
this section gives examples of mathematical theories that are developed entirely from a set of non logical axioms
a rigorous treatment of any of these topics begins with a specification of these axioms
basic theories such as arithmetic real analysis and complex analysis are often introduced non axiomatically but implicitly or explicitly there is generally an assumption that the axioms being used are the axioms of zermelo fraenkel set theory with choice abbreviated zfc or some very similar system of axiomatic set theory like von neumann bernays gdel set theory a conservative extension of zfc
sometimes slightly stronger theories such as morse kelley set theory or set theory with a strongly inaccessible cardinal allowing the use of a grothendieck universe is used but in fact most mathematicians can actually prove all they need in systems weaker than zfc such as second order arithmetic
the study of topology in mathematics extends all over through point set topology algebraic topology differential topology and all the related paraphernalia such as homology theory homotopy theory
the development of abstract algebra brought with itself group theory rings fields and galois theory
this list could be expanded to include most fields of mathematics including measure theory ergodic theory probability representation theory and differential geometry
the peano axioms are the most widely used axiomatization of first order arithmetic
they are a set of axioms strong enough to prove many important facts about number theory and they allowed gdel to establish his famous second incompleteness theorem
the standard structure is formula where formula is the set of natural numbers formula is the successor function and formula is naturally interpreted as the number
probably the oldest and most famous list of axioms are the euclids postulates of plane geometry
the axioms are referred to as because for nearly two millennia the fifth postulate was suspected of being derivable from the first four
ultimately the fifth postulate was found to be independent of the first four
one can assume that exactly one parallel through a point outside a line exists or that infinitely many exist
this choice gives us two alternative forms of geometry in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to exactly degrees or less respectively and are known as euclidean and hyperbolic geometries
if one also removes the second postulate then elliptic geometry arises where there is no parallel through a point outside a line and in which the interior angles of a triangle add up to more than degrees
the objectives of the study are within the domain of real numbers
the real numbers are uniquely picked out by the properties of a dedekind complete ordered field meaning that any nonempty set of real numbers with an upper bound has a least upper bound
however expressing these properties as axioms requires the use of second order logic
the lwenheim skolem theorems tell us that if we restrict ourselves to first order logic any axiom system for the reals admits other models including both models that are smaller than the reals and models that are larger
some of the latter are studied in non standard analysis
a deductive system consists of a set formula of logical axioms a set formula of non logical axioms and a set formula of rules of inference
a desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete
a system is said to be complete if for all formulas formula formula that is for any statement that is a logical consequence of formula there actually exists a deduction of the statement from formula
this is sometimes expressed as everything that is true is provable but it must be understood that true here means made true by the set of axioms and not for example true in the intended interpretation
gdels completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system
note that completeness has a different meaning here than it does in the context of gdels first incompleteness theorem which states that no recursive consistent set of non logical axioms formula of the theory of arithmetic is complete in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement formula such that neither formula nor formula can be proved from the given set of axioms
there is thus on the one hand the notion of completeness of a deductive system and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of non logical axioms
the completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem despite their names do not contradict one another
early mathematicians regarded axiomatic geometry as a model of physical space and obviously there could only be one such model
the idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the th century and the developers of systems such as boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic
galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted
ultimately the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and modern algebra was born
in the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas as long as they are not known to be inconsistent
alpha is the first letter of the greek alphabet
in the system of greek numerals it has a value of one
alpha is derived from the phoenician letter aleph which is the west semitic word for ox
letters that arose from alpha include the latin letter a and the cyrillic letter
in ancient greek alpha was pronounced and could be either phonemically long
where there is ambiguity long and short alpha are sometimes written with a macron and breve today
in modern greek vowel length has been lost and all instances of alpha simply represent the open front unrounded vowel
in the polytonic orthography of greek alpha like other vowel letters can occur with several diacritic marks any of three accent symbols and either of two breathing marks as well as combinations of these
it can also combine with the iota subscript
in the attic ionic dialect of ancient greek long alpha fronted to
in ionic the shift took place in all positions
in attic the shift did not take place after epsilon iota and rho
in doric and aeolic long alpha is preserved in all positions
privative a is the ancient greek prefix or added to words to negate them
it originates from the proto indo european and is cognate with english un
copulative a is the greek prefix or
it comes from proto indo european
the letter alpha represents various concepts in physics and chemistry including alpha radiation angular acceleration alpha particles alpha carbon and strength of electromagnetic interaction
alpha also stands for thermal expansion coefficient of a compound in physical chemistry
it is also commonly used in mathematics in algebraic solutions representing quantities such as angles
furthermore in mathematics the letter alpha is used to denote the area underneath a normal curve in statistics to denote significance level when proving null and alternative hypotheses
in ethology it is used to name the dominant individual in a group of animals
in aerodynamics the letter is used as a symbol for the angle of attack of an aircraft and the word alpha is used as a synonym for this property
in mathematical logic is sometimes used as a placeholder for ordinal numbers
the proportionality operator is sometimes mistaken for alpha
the uppercase letter alpha is not generally used as a symbol because it tends to be rendered identically to the uppercase latin a
in the international phonetic alphabet the letter which looks similar to the lower case alpha represents the open back unrounded vowel
the phoenician alphabet was adopted for greek in the early th century bc perhaps in euboea
the majority of the letters of the phoenician alphabet were adopted into greek with much the same sounds as they had had in phoenician but leph the phoenician letter representing the glottal stop was adopted as representing the vowel similarly h and ayin are phoenician consonants that became greek vowels epsilon and omicron respectively
plutarch in moralia presents a discussion on why the letter alpha stands first in the alphabet
ammonius asks plutarch what he being a boeotian has to say for cadmus the phoenician who reputedly settled in thebes and introduced the alphabet to greece placing alpha first because it is the phoenician name for ox which unlike hesiod the phoenicians considered not the second or third but the first of all necessities
nothing at all plutarch replied
he then added that he would rather be assisted by lamprias his own grandfather than by dionysus grandfather ie cadmus
for lamprias had said that the first articulate sound made is alpha because it is very plain and simple the air coming off the mouth does not require any motion of the tongue and therefore this is the first sound that children make
according to plutarchs natural order of attribution of the vowels to the planets alpha was connected with the moon
as the first letter of the alphabet alpha as a greek numeral came to represent the number
therefore alpha both as a symbol and term is used to refer to the first or primary or principal occurrence or status of a thing
the new testament has god declaring himself to be the alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
consequently the term alpha has also come to be used to denote primary position in social hierarchy examples being alpha males or pack leaders

in their first factory jobs heidi became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked
alvin became a millwright and welder

the book has never been out of print and has been translated into dozens of languages

during this period in his career toffler lectured worldwide taught at several schools and met world leaders such as mikhail gorbachev along with key executives and military officials
toffler stated many of his ideas during an interview with the australian broadcasting corporation in
society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest he said
society needs people who work in hospitals
society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive theyre emotional theyre affectional
you cant run the society on data and computers alone
his opinions about the future of education many of which were in future shock have often been quoted
an often misattributed quote however is that of psychologist herbert gerjuoy tomorrows illiterate will not be the man who cant read he will be the man who has not learned how to learn
early in his career after traveling to other countries he became aware of the new and myriad inputs that visitors received from these other cultures
he explained during an interview that some visitors would become truly disoriented and upset by the strange environment which he described as a reaction to culture shock
from that issue he foresaw another problem for the future when a culturally new environment comes to you
and comes to you rapidly
that kind of sudden cultural change within ones own country which he felt many would not understand would lead to a similar reaction one of future shock which he wrote about in his book by that title
toffler writes in the third wave toffler describes three types of societies based on the concept of waves each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside
he describes the first wave as the society after agrarian revolution and replaced the first hunter gatherer cultures
the second wave he labels society during the industrial revolution
that period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional nuclear family and initiated a factory like education system and the growth of the corporation
toffler said the third wave was a term he coined to describe the post industrial society which began in the late s
his description of this period dovetails with other futurist writers who also wrote about the information age space age electronic era global village terms which highlighted a scientific technological revolution
the tofflers claimed to have predicted a number of geopolitical events such as the collapse of the soviet union the fall of the berlin wall and the future economic growth in the asia pacific region
toffler often visited with dignitaries in asia including chinas zhao ziyang singapores lee kuan yew and south koreas kim dae jung all of whom were influenced by his views as asias emerging markets increased in global significance during the s and s
although they had originally censored some of his books and ideas chinas government cited him along with franklin roosevelt and bill gates as being among the westerners who had most influenced their country
the third wave along with a video documentary based on it became best sellers in china and were widely distributed to schools
the videos success inspired the marketing of videos on related themes in the late s by infowars whose name is derived from the term coined by toffler in the book
tofflers influence on asian thinkers was summed up in an article in daedalus published by the american academy of arts sciences us house speaker newt gingrich publicly lauded his ideas about the future and urged members of congress to read tofflers book creating a new civilization
others such as aol founder steve case cited tofflers the third wave as a formative influence on his thinking which inspired him to write the third wave an entrepreneurs vision of the future in
case said that toffler was a real pioneer in helping people companies and even countries lean into the future
in ted turner founded cnn which he said was inspired by tofflers forecasting the end of the dominance of the three main television networks
turners company turner broadcasting published tofflers creating a new civilization in
shortly after the book was released the former soviet president mikhail gorbachev hosted the global governance conference in san francisco with the theme toward a new civilization which was attended by dozens of world figures including the tofflers george h
bush margaret thatcher carl sagan abba eban and turner with his then wife actress jane fonda
mexican billionaire carlos slim was influenced by his works and became a friend of the writer
global marketer jd power also said he was inspired by tofflers works
since the s people had tried to make sense out of the effect of new technologies and social change a problem which made tofflers writings widely influential beyond the confines of scientific economic and public policy
his works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms usually with the same argumentation used against futurology that foreseeing the future is nigh impossible
techno music pioneer juan atkins cites tofflers phrase techno rebels in the third wave as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create musician curtis mayfield released a disco song called future shock later covered in an electro version by herbie hancock
science fiction author john brunner wrote the shockwave rider from the concept of future shock
the nightclub toffler in rotterdam is named after him

best seller in china

writer editor stan lee and artist and co plotter steve ditko created the character of spider man and the pair produced issues from march to july
ditko left after the th issue while lee remained as writer until issue
since then many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years chronicling the adventures of marvels most identifiable hero
the amazing spider man has been the characters flagship series for his first fifty years in publication and was the only monthly series to star spider man until peter parker the spectacular spider man in although saw the debut of marvel team up with the vast majority of issues featuring spider man along with a rotating cast of other marvel characters
most of the major characters and villains of the spider man saga have been introduced in amazing and with few exceptions it is where most key events in the characters history have occurred
the title was published continuously until no
when marvel comics relaunched it as vol
but on spider mans th anniversary this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series beginning again with issue no
and lasting until the final issue no
due to strong sales on the characters first appearance in amazing fantasy no
spider man was given his own ongoing series in march
the initial years of the series under lee and ditko chronicled spider mans nascent career as a masked super human vigilante with his civilian life as hard luck yet perpetually good humored and well meaning teenager peter parker
peter balanced his career as spider man with his job as a freelance photographer for the daily bugle under the bombastic editor publisher j
jonah jameson to support himself and his frail aunt may
at the same time peter dealt with public hostility towards spider man and the antagonism of his classmates flash thompson and liz allan at midtown high school while embarking on a tentative ill fated romance with jamesons secretary betty brant
by focusing on parkers everyday problems lee and ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed self doubting superhero and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick
ditkos quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of marvels most prominent artist jack kirby and combined with the humor and pathos of lees writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos
most of spider mans key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time
issue no
featured the first appearances of j
jonah jameson and his astronaut son john jameson and the supervillain the chameleon
it included the heros first encounter with the superhero team the fantastic four
issue no
featured the first appearance of the vulture and the tinkerer as well as the beginning of parkers freelance photography career at the newspaper the daily bugle
the lee ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters including doctor octopus in no
the sandman and betty brant in no
the lizard in no
living brain in no
electro in no
mysterio in no
the green goblin in no
kraven the hunter in no
reporter ned leeds in no
and the scorpion in no
the molten man was introduced in no
which also featured parkers graduation from high school
peter began attending empire state university in no
which featured the first appearances of friends and classmates gwen stacy and harry osborn
harrys father norman osborn first appeared in no
as a member of jamesons country club but was not named nor revealed as harrys father until no
one of the most celebrated issues of the lee ditko run is no
the third part of the story arc if this be my destiny
which features the dramatic scene of spider man through force of will and thoughts of family escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery
comics historian les daniels noted that steve ditko squeezes every ounce of anguish out of spider mans predicament complete with visions of the uncle he failed and the aunt he has sworn to save
peter david observed that after his origin this two page sequence from amazing spider man no
is perhaps the best loved sequence from the stan lee steve ditko era
steve saffel stated the full page ditko image from the amazing spider man no
is one of the most powerful ever to appear in the series and influenced writers and artists for many years to come
and matthew k
manning wrote that ditkos illustrations for the first few pages of this lee story included what would become one of the most iconic scenes in spider mans history
the story was chosen as no
in the greatest marvels of all time poll of marvels readers in
editor robert greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that these first five pages are a modern day equivalent to shakespeare as parkers soliloquy sets the stage for his next action
and with dramatic pacing and storytelling ditko delivers one of the great sequences in all comics
although credited only as artist for most of his run ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them leaving lee to script the dialogue
a rift between ditko and lee developed and the two men were not on speaking terms long before ditko completed his last issue the amazing spider man no
the exact reasons for the ditko lee split have never been fully explained
spider man successor artist john romita sr in a deposition recalled that lee and ditko ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything cultural social historically everything they disagreed on characters
in successor penciler romita srs first issue no
nemesis the green goblin discovers spider mans secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero
romitas spider man more polished and heroic looking than ditkos became the model for two decades
the lee romita era saw the introduction of such characters as daily bugle managing editor robbie robertson in no
and nypd captain george stacy father of parkers girlfriend gwen stacy in no
the most important supporting character to be introduced during the romita era was mary jane watson who made her first full appearance in no
although she first appeared in no
with her face obscured and had been mentioned since no
peter david wrote in that romita made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant blocked the readers view of her face in issue no
and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment
romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used ann margret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her form fitting short skirts
lee and romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in parkers world by improving parkers relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on spider mans adventures
the stories became more topical addressing issues such as civil rights racism prisoners rights the vietnam war and political elections
issue no
introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the kingpin who would become a major force as well in the superhero series daredevil
other notable first appearances in the lee romita era include the rhino in no
the shocker in no
the prowler in no
and the kingpins son richard fisk in no

this was the first spider man story to be penciled by gil kane who would alternate drawing duties with romita for the next year and a half and would draw several landmark issues
one such story took place in the controversial issues
writer editor lee defied the comics code authority with this story in which parkers friend harry osborn was hospitalized after over dosing on pills
lee wrote this story upon a request from the u
department of health education and welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs
citing its dictum against depicting drug use even in an anti drug context the cca refused to put its seal on these issues
with the approval of marvel publisher martin goodman lee had the comics published without the seal
the comics sold well and marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts
the cca subsequently loosened the code to permit negative depictions of drugs among other new freedoms
the six arms saga of introduced morbius the living vampire
the second installment was the first amazing spider man story not written by co creator lee with roy thomas taking over writing the book for several months before lee returned to write
lee who was going on to become marvel comics publisher with thomas becoming editor in chief then turned writing duties over to year old gerry conway who scripted the series through
romita penciled conways first half dozen issues which introduced the gangster hammerhead in no
kane then succeeded romita as penciler although romita would continue inking kane for a time
issue featured the death of gwen stacy at the hands of the green goblin in the night gwen stacy died
her demise and the goblins apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of spider man

roger stern who had written nearly issues of sister title the spectacular spider man took over amazing with
during his two years on the title stern augmented the backgrounds of long established spider man villains and with romita jr created the mysterious supervillain the hobgoblin in
fans engaged with the mystery of the hobgoblins secret identity which continued throughout and
one lasting change was the reintroduction of mary jane watson as a more serious mature woman who becomes peters confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity

azincourt historically known in english as agincourt is a commune in the pas de calais department in northern france
it is situated north west of saint pol sur ternoise on the d road between hesdin and fruges
the late medieval battle of agincourt between the english and the french took place in the commune in
the name is attested as aisincurt in derived from a germanic masculine name aizo aizino and the early northern french word curt
the name has no etymological link with agincourt meurthe et moselle which is derived separately from another germanic male name ingin
azincourt is known for being near the site of the battle fought on october in which the army led by king henry v of england defeated the forces led by charles dalbret on behalf of charles vi of france which has gone down in history as the battle of agincourt
according to m
forrest the french knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle
after he became king in henry viii is purported to have commissioned an english translation of a life of henry v so that he could emulate him on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against france would help him to impose himself on the european stage

the battle as was the tradition was named after a nearby castle called azincourt
the castle has since disappeared and the settlement now known as azincourt adopted the name in the seventeenth century
john cassell wrote in that the village of azincourt itself is now a group of dirty farmhouses and wretched cottages but where the hottest of the battle raged between that village and the commune of tramecourt there still remains a wood precisely corresponding with the one in which henry placed his ambush and there are yet existing the foundations of the castle of azincourt from which the king named the field
the original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of action man figures
this has now been replaced by the centre historique mdival dazincourt a more professional museum conference centre and exhibition space incorporating laser video slide shows audio commentaries and some interactive elements
the museum building is shaped like a longbow similar to those used at the battle by archers under king henry
since a large medieval festival organised by the local community the chm the azincourt alliance and various other uk societies commemorating the battle local history and medieval life arts and crafts has been held in the village
prior to this date the festival was held in october but due to the inclement weather and local heavy clay soil making the festival difficult it was moved to the last sunday in july

using misleading statistics he promoted himself as having performed an armaments miracle that was widely credited with keeping germany in the war
in speer established a task force to increase production of fighter aircraft
it became instrumental in exploiting slave labor for the benefit of the german war effort
after the war albert speer was among the major war criminals charged with the crimes of the nazi regime before the international military tribunal
he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for the use of slave labor narrowly avoiding a death sentence
having served his full term speer was released in
he used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books inside the third reich and
speers books were a success the public was fascinated by an inside view of the third reich
speer died of a stroke in
little remains of his personal architectural work
through his autobiographies and interviews speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the third reich
he continued to deny explicit knowledge of and responsibility for the holocaust
this image dominated his historiography in the decades following the war giving rise to the speer myth the perception of him as an apolitical technocrat responsible for revolutionizing the german war machine
the myth began to fall apart in the s when the armaments miracle was attributed to nazi propaganda
adam tooze wrote in the wages of destruction that the idea that speer was an apolitical technocrat was absurd
martin kitchen writing in stated that much of the increase in germanys arms production was actually due to systems instituted by speers predecessor and furthermore that speer was intimately involved in the final solution
speer was born in mannheim into an upper middle class family
he was the second of three sons of luise mthilde wilhelmine and albert friedrich speer
in the family leased their mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in heidelberg
henry t
king deputy prosecutor at the nuremberg trials who later wrote a book about speer said love and warmth were lacking in the household of speers youth
his brothers ernst and hermann bullied him throughout his childhood
speer was active in sports taking up skiing and mountaineering
he followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture
speer began his architectural studies at the university of karlsruhe instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the hyperinflation crisis of limited his parents income
in when the crisis had abated he transferred to the much more reputable technical university of munich
in he transferred again this time to the technical university of berlin where he studied under heinrich tessenow whom speer greatly admired
after passing his exams in speer became tessenows assistant a high honor for a man of
as such speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies
in munich speer began a close friendship ultimately spanning over years with rudolf wolters who also studied under tessenow
in mid speer began courting margarete weber the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed workers
the relationship was frowned upon by speers class conscious mother who felt the webers were socially inferior
despite this opposition the two married in berlin on august seven years elapsed before margarete was invited to stay at her in laws home
the couple would have six children together but albert speer grew increasingly distant from his family after
he remained so even after his release from imprisonment in despite their efforts to forge closer bonds
in january speer applied for nazi party membership and on march he became member number
the same year with stipends shrinking amid the depression speer surrendered his position as tessenows assistant and moved to mannheim hoping to make a living as an architect
after he failed to do so his father gave him a part time job as manager of his properties
in july the speers visited berlin to help out the party before the reichstag elections
while they were there his friend nazi party official karl hanke recommended the young architect to joseph goebbels to help renovate the partys berlin headquarters
when the commission was completed speer returned to mannheim and remained there as hitler took office in january
the organizers of the nuremberg rally asked speer to submit designs for the rally bringing him into contact with hitler for the first time
neither the organizers nor rudolf hess were willing to decide whether to approve the plans and hess sent speer to hitlers munich apartment to seek his approval
this work won speer his first national post as nazi party commissioner for the artistic and technical presentation of party rallies and demonstrations
shortly after hitler came into power he began to make plans to rebuild the chancellery
at the end of he contracted paul troost to renovate the entire building
hitler appointed speer whose work for goebbels had impressed him to manage the building site for troost
as chancellor hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations
after one of these briefings hitler invited speer to lunch to the architects great excitement
speer quickly became part of hitlers inner circle he was expected to call on him in the morning for a walk or chat to provide consultation on architectural matters and to discuss hitlers ideas
most days he was invited to dinner
in the english version of his memoirs speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his monthly dues
he assumed his german readers would not be so gullible and told them the nazi party offered a new mission
he was more forthright in an interview with william hamsher in which he said he joined the party in order to save germany from communism
after the war he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance
like many of those in power in the third reich he was not an ideologue nor was he anything more than an instinctive anti semite
the historian magnus brechtken discussing speer said he did not give anti jewish public speeches and that his anti semitism can best be understood through his actions which were anti semitic
brechtken added that throughout speers life his central motives were to gain power rule and acquire wealth
when troost died on january speer effectively replaced him as the partys chief architect
hitler appointed speer as head of the chief office for construction which placed him nominally on hesss staff
one of speers first commissions after troosts death was the zeppelinfeld stadium in nuremberg
it was used for nazi propaganda rallies and can be seen in leni riefenstahls propaganda film triumph of the will
the building was able to hold people
speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight nazis
nuremberg was the site of many official nazi buildings
many more buildings were planned
if built the german stadium would have accommodated spectators
speer modified werner marchs design for the being built for the summer olympics
he added a stone exterior that pleased hitler
speer designed the german pavilion for the international exposition in paris
on january hitler appointed speer as general building inspector for the reich capital
this carried with it the rank of state secretary in the reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the berlin city government
he was to report directly to hitler and was independent of both the mayor and the gauleiter of berlin
hitler ordered speer to develop plans to rebuild berlin
these centered on a three mile long grand boulevard running from north to south which speer called the prachtstrasse or street of magnificence he also referred to it as the north south axis
at the northern end of the boulevard speer planned to build the volkshalle a huge domed assembly hall over high with floor space for people
at the southern end of the avenue a great triumphal arch almost high and able to fit the arc de triomphe inside its opening was planned
the existing berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled and two large new stations built
speer hired wolters as part of his design team with special responsibility for the prachtstrasse
the outbreak of world war ii in led to the postponement and later the abandonment of these plans
plans to build a new reich chancellery had been underway since
land had been purchased by the end of and starting in march the first buildings were demolished to create space at vostrae
speer was involved virtually from the beginning
in the aftermath of the night of the long knives he had been commissioned to renovate the borsig palace on the corner of vostrae and wilhelmstrae as headquarters of the sturmabteilung
he completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by may
in june he charged a personal honorarium of reichsmark and estimated the chancellery would be completed within three to four years
detailed plans were completed in july and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on january
on january speer received plenipotentiary powers from hitler to finish the new chancellery by january
for propaganda hitler claimed during the topping out ceremony on august that he had ordered speer to complete the new chancellery that year
shortages of labor meant the construction workers had to work in ten to twelve hour shifts
the schutzstaffel built two concentration camps in and used the inmates to quarry stone for its construction
a brick factory was built near the oranienburg concentration camp at speers behest when someone commented on the poor conditions there speer stated the yids got used to making bricks while in egyptian captivity
the chancellery was completed in early january
the building itself was hailed by hitler as the crowning glory of the greater german political empire
during the chancellery project the pogrom of kristallnacht took place
speer made no mention of it in the first draft of inside the third reich
it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the central synagogue in berlin from his car
kristallnacht accelerated speers ongoing efforts to dispossess berlins jews from their homes
from on speers department used the nuremberg laws to evict jewish tenants of non jewish landlords in berlin to make way for non jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing
eventually jews were displaced by these measures
speer denied he knew they were being put on holocaust trains and claimed that those displaced were completely free and their families were still in their apartments
he also said
en route to my ministry on the city highway i could see
crowds of people on the platform of nearby nikolassee railroad station
i knew that these must be berlin jews who were being evacuated
i am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as i drove past
i presumably had a sense of somber events
matthias schmidt said speer had personally inspected concentration camps and described his comments as an outright farce
martin kitchen described speers often repeated line that he knew nothing of the dreadful things as hollow because not only was he fully aware of the fate of the jews he was actively participating in their persecution
as germany started world war ii in europe speer instituted quick reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris before long these units would be used to clear bomb sites
speer used forced jewish labor on these projects in addition to regular german workers
construction stopped on the berlin and nremberg plans at the outbreak of war
though stockpiling of materials and other work continued this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for the armament industry
speers offices undertook building work for each branch of the military and for the ss using slave labor
speers building work made him among the wealthiest of the nazi elite
as one of the younger and more ambitious men in hitlers inner circle speer was approaching the height of his power
in prussian minister president hermann gring had appointed him to the prussian state council
in he was elected to the reichstag from electoral constituency
on february reich minister of armaments and munitions fritz todt died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from hitlers eastern headquarters at rastenburg
speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted todts offer to fly with him to berlin
speer cancelled some hours before take off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with hitler
hitler appointed speer in todts place
martin kitchen a british historian says that the choice was not surprising
speer was loyal to hitler and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job
speer succeeded todt not only as reich minister but in all his other powerful positions including inspector general of german roadways inspector general for water and energy and head of the nazi partys office of technology
at the same time hitler also appointed speer as head of the organisation todt a massive government controlled construction company
characteristically hitler did not give speer any clear remit he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control
as an example he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under grings four year plan
gring was reluctant to grant this
however speer secured hitlers support and on march gring signed a decree naming speer general plenipotentiary for armament tasks in the four year plan
speer proved to be ambitious unrelenting and ruthless
speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army but in the whole armed forces
it did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control
by april speer had persuaded gring to create a three member central planning board within the four year plan which he used to obtain supreme authority over procurement and allocation of raw materials and scheduling of production in order to consolidate german war production in a single agency
speer was fted at the time and in the post war era for performing an armaments miracle in which german war production dramatically increased
this miracle was brought to a halt in the summer of by among other factors the first sustained allied bombing
other factors probably contributed to the increase more than speer himself
germanys armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor todt
naval armaments were not under speers supervision until october nor the luftwaffes armaments until june of the following year
yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under speers control
another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry
production of every type of weapon peaked in june and july but there was now a severe shortage of fuel
after august oil from the romanian fields was no longer available
oil production became so low that any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle
as minister of armaments speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army
with hitlers full agreement he decided to prioritize tank production and he was given unrivaled power to ensure success
hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks but kept changing his mind about the specifications
this delayed the program and speer was unable to remedy the situation
in consequence despite tank production having the highest priority relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it
this led to a significant german army failure at the battle of prokhorovka a major turning point on the eastern front against the soviet red army
as head of organisation todt speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps
he agreed to expand auschwitz and some other camps allocating million reichsmarks for the work to be carried out
this allowed an extra huts to be built at auschwitz increasing the total human capacity to
included in the building works was material to build gas chambers crematoria and morgues
the ss called this professor speers special programme
speer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces there was a labor shortage in the war economy and not enough workers for his factories
in response hitler appointed fritz sauckel as a manpower dictator to obtain new workers
speer and sauckel cooperated closely to meet speers labor demands
hitler gave sauckel a free hand to obtain labor something that delighted speer who had requested voluntary laborers to meet the need for armament workers
sauckel had whole villages in france holland and belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to speers factories
sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods
in occupied areas of the soviet union that had been subject to partisan action civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in germany
by april sauckel had supplied voluntary laborers forced laborers prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to speer for use in his armaments factories
it was for the maltreatment of these people that speer was principally convicted at the nuremberg trials
following his appointment as minister of armaments speer was in control of armaments production solely for the army
he coveted control of the production of armaments for the luftwaffe and kriegsmarine as well
he set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition
his close relationship with hitler provided him with political protection and he was able to outwit and outmaneuver his rivals in the regime
hitlers cabinet was dismayed at his tactics but regardless he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power
by july he had gained control of armaments production for the luftwaffe and kriegsmarine
in august he took control of most of the ministry of economics to become in admiral dnitzs words europes economic dictator
his formal title was changed on september to reich minister for armaments and war production
he had become one of the most powerful people in nazi germany
speer and his hand picked director of submarine construction otto merker believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output
this belief proved incorrect and speer and merkers attempt to build the kriegsmarines new generation of submarines the type xxi and type xxiii as prefabricated sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program
the designs were rushed into production and the completed submarines were crippled by flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed
while dozens of submarines were built few ever entered service
in december speer visited organisation todt workers in lapland while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months
he was under the dubious care of professor karl gebhardt at a medical clinic called hohenlychen where patients mysteriously failed to survive
in mid january speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill
concerned about retaining power he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the armaments ministry from his bedside
speers illness coincided with the allied big week a series of bombing raids on the german aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production
his political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with hitler
he lost hitlers unconditional support and began to lose power
in response to the allied big week adolf hitler authorized the creation of a fighter staff committee
its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production
the task force was established by march orders of speer with support from erhard milch of the reich aviation ministry
production of german fighter aircraft more than doubled between and
the growth however consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for allied aircraft
on august speer merged the fighter staff into a newly formed armament staff committee
the fighter staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labor in the war economy
the ss provided prisoners for separate projects from various concentration camps including mittelbau dora
prisoners worked for junkers messerschmitt henschel and among others
to increase production speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce
those who feigned illness slacked off sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps
in this became endemic over half a million workers were arrested
by this time people were working in speers underground factories
these factories were death traps discipline was brutal with regular executions
there were so many corpses at the dora underground factory for example that the crematorium was overwhelmed
speers own staff described the conditions there as hell
the largest technological advance under speers command came through the rocket program
it began in but had not supplied any weaponry
speer enthusiastically supported the program and in march made an order for a rockets the predecessor of the worlds first ballistic missile the v rocket
the rockets were researched at a facility in peenemnde along with the v flying bomb
the v s first target was paris on september
the program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy
the large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness
the rockets were built at an underground factory at mittelwerk
labor to build the a rockets came from the mittelbau dora concentration camp
of the people who ended up at the camp died due to the appalling conditions
on april speer lost control of organisation todt to his deputy franz xaver dorsch
he opposed the assassination attempt against hitler on july
he was not involved in the plot and played a minor role in the regimes efforts to regain control over berlin after hitler survived
after the plot speers rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party
he lost yet more authority
losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the german economy from late
air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies
in january speer told goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year
however he concluded that the war was lost after soviet forces captured the important silesian industrial region later that month
nevertheless speer believed that germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the allies than the unconditional surrender they insisted upon
during january and february speer claimed that his ministry would deliver decisive weapons and a large increase in armaments production which would bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield
speer gained control over the railways in february and asked heinrich himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair
by mid march speer had accepted that germanys economy would collapse within the next eight weeks
while he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture so that they could be used after the war he still supported the wars continuation
speer provided hitler with a memorandum on march which detailed germanys dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure
three days later he also proposed to hitler that germanys remaining military resources be concentrated along the rhine and vistula rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting
this ignored military realities as the german armed forces were unable to match the allies firepower and were facing total defeat
hitler rejected speers proposal to cease demolitions
instead he issued the nero decree on march which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated
speer was appalled by this order and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it
during a meeting with speer on march hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions
speer ended them though the army continued to blow up bridges
by april little was left of the armaments industry and speer had few official duties
speer visited the fhrerbunker on april for the last time
he met hitler and toured the damaged chancellery before leaving berlin to return to hamburg
on april the day before committing suicide hitler dictated a final political testament which dropped speer from the successor government
speer was to be replaced by his subordinate karl otto saur
speer was disappointed that hitler had not selected him as his successor
after hitlers death speer offered his services to the so called flensburg government headed by hitlers successor karl dnitz
he took a role in that short lived regime as minister of industry and production
speer provided information to the allies regarding the effects of the air war and on a broad range of subjects beginning on may
on may two weeks after the surrender of german forces british troops arrested the members of the flensburg government and brought nazi germany to a formal end
speer was taken to several internment centres for nazi officials and interrogated
in september he was told that he would be tried for war crimes and several days later he was moved to nuremberg and incarcerated there
speer was indicted on four counts participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace planning initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace war crimes and crimes against humanity
the chief united states prosecutor robert h
jackson of the us supreme court said speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into german war industries which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation
speers attorney hans flchsner successfully contrasted speer from other defendants and portrayed him as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non ideologue
speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity principally for the use of slave labor and forced labor
he was acquitted on the other two counts
he had claimed that he was unaware of nazi extermination plans and the allies had no proof that he was aware
his claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in and publicly disclosed in
on october he was sentenced to years imprisonment
while three of the eight judges advocated the death penalty for speer the other judges did not and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions
on july speer was transferred to spandau prison in berlin to serve his prison term
there he was known as prisoner number five
speers parents died while he was incarcerated
his father who died in despised the nazis and was silent upon meeting hitler
his mother died in
as a nazi party member she had greatly enjoyed dining with hitler
wolters and longtime speer secretary annemarie kempf while not permitted direct communication with speer in spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests speer put in letters to his wife the only written communication he was officially allowed
beginning in speer had the services of toni proost a sympathetic dutch orderly to smuggle mail and his writings
in wolters opened a bank account for speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from speers activities during the war
initially the funds were used only to support speers family but increasingly the money was used for other purposes
they paid for toni proost to go on holiday and for bribes to those who might be able to secure speers release
once speer became aware of the existence of the fund he sent detailed instructions about what to do with the money
wolters raised a total of dm for speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence
the prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs
speer was able to have his writings sent to wolters however and they eventually amounted to pages
he had completed his memoirs by november which became the basis of inside the third reich
in spandau diaries speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a faustian bargain for which he endured a harsh prison sentence
much of speers energy was dedicated to keeping fit both physically and mentally during his long confinement
spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening
speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns flower beds shrubbery and fruit trees
to make his daily walks around the garden more engaging speer embarked on an imaginary trip around the globe
carefully measuring distance travelled each day he mapped distances to the real world geography
he had walked more than ending his sentence near guadalajara mexico
speer also read studied architectural journals and brushed up on english and french
in his writings speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison
his sentence of twenty years amounted to days which only allotted one and a half days per book
speers supporters maintained calls for his release
among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were charles de gaulle and us diplomat george wildman ball
willy brandt was an advocate of his release putting an end to the de nazification proceedings against him which could have caused his property to be confiscated
speers efforts for an early release came to naught
the soviet union having demanded a death sentence at trial was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence
speer served a full term and was released at midnight on october
speers release from prison was a worldwide media event
reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside spandau and the lobby of the hotel berlin where speer spent the night
he said little reserving most comments for a major interview published in der spiegel in november
although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career his sole project a collaboration for a brewery was unsuccessful
instead he revised his spandau writings into two autobiographical books inside the third reich and
he later published a work about himmler and the ss which has been published in english as the slave state heinrich himmlers masterplan for ss supremacy or infiltration how heinrich himmler schemed to build an ss industrial empire
speer was aided in shaping the works by joachim fest and wolf jobst siedler from the publishing house ullstein
he found himself unable to re establish a relationship with his children even with his son albert who had also become an architect
according to speers daughter hilde schramm one by one my sister and brothers gave up
there was no communication
he supported hermann his brother financially after the war
however his other brother ernst had died in the battle of stalingrad despite repeated requests from his parents for speer to repatriate him
following his release from spandau speer donated the chronicle his personal diary to the german federal archives
it had been edited by wolters and made no mention of the jews
david irving discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited chronicle and independent documents
speer asked wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but wolters refused and retained an original copy
wolters friendship with speer deteriorated and one year before speers death wolters gave matthias schmidt access to the unedited chronicle
schmidt authored the first book that was highly critical of speer
speers memoirs were a phenomenal success
the public was fascinated by an inside view of the third reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight
importantly he provided an alibi to older germans who had been nazis
if speer who had been so close to hitler had not known the full extent of the crimes of the nazi regime and had just been following orders then they could tell themselves and others they too had done the same
so great was the need to believe this speer myth that fest and siedler were able to strengthen it even in the face of mounting historical evidence to the contrary
speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers
in october he made his first trip to britain flying to london to be interviewed on the bbc midweek programme
in the same year he appeared on the television programme the world at war
speer returned to london in to participate in the bbc newsnight programme
he suffered a stroke and died in london on september
he had remained married to his wife but he had formed a relationship with a german woman living in london and was with her at the time of his death
his daughter margret nissen wrote in her memoirs that after his release from spandau he spent all of his time constructing the speer myth
after his release from spandau speer portrayed himself as the good nazi
he was well educated middle class and bourgeois and could contrast himself with those who in the popular mind typified bad nazis
in his memoirs and interviews he had distorted the truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as myths
speer even invented his own births circumstances stating falsely that he was born at midday amid crashes of thunder and bells of the nearby christ church whereas it was between three and five oclock and the church was built only some years after
speer took his myth making to a mass media level and his cunning apologies were reproduced frequently in post war germany
isabell trommer writes in her biography of speer that fest and siedler were co authors of speers memoirs and co creators of his myths
in return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements
speer siedler and fest had constructed a masterpiece the image of the good nazi remained in place for decades despite historical evidence indicating that it was false
speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an apolitical technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the third reich
this construction was accepted almost at face value by historian hugh trevor roper when investigating the death of adolf hitler for british intelligence and in writing the last days of hitler
trevor roper frequently refers to speer as a technocrat nourished a technocrats philosophy one who cared only for his building projects or his ministerial duties and who thought that politics was irrelevant at least until hitlers nero decree which speer according to his own telling worked assiduously to counter
trevor roper who calls speer an administrative genius whose basic instincts were peaceful and constructive does take speer to task however for his failure to recognize the immorality of hitler and nazism calling him the real criminal of nazi germany for ten years he sat at the very centre of political power his keen intelligence diagnosed the nature and observed the mutations of nazi government and policy he saw and despised the personalities around him he heard their outrageous orders and understood their fantastic ambitions but he did nothing
supposing politics to be irrelevant he turned aside and built roads and bridges and factories while the logical consequences of government by madmen emerged
ultimately when their emergence involved the ruin of all his work speer accepted the consequences and acted
then it was too late germany had been destroyed
after speers death matthias schmidt published a book that demonstrated that speer had ordered the eviction of jews from their berlin homes
by historians had amply demonstrated that speer had lied extensively
even so public perceptions of speer did not change substantially until heinrich breloer aired a biographical film on tv in
the film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal
adam tooze in his book the wages of destruction said speer had manoeuvred himself through the ranks of the regime skillfully and ruthlessly and that the idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was absurd
trommer said he was not an apolitical technocrat instead he was one of the most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in the nazi regime
kitchen said he had deceived the nuremberg tribunal and post war germany
brechtken said that if his extensive involvement in the holocaust had been known at the time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death
the image of the good nazi was supported by numerous speer myths
in addition to the myth that he was an apolitical technocrat he claimed he did not have full knowledge of the holocaust or the persecution of the jews
another myth posits that speer revolutionized the german war machine after his appointment as minister of armaments
he was credited with a dramatic increase in the shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping germany in the war
another myth centered around a faked plan to assassinate hitler with poisonous gas
the idea for this myth came to him after he recalled the panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system
he fabricated the additional details
brechtken wrote that his most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a french journalist in
the journalist described an invented scenario in which speer had refused hitlers orders and hitler had left with tears in his eyes
speer liked the scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs
the journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths
speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of hitlers leadership
despite his opposition to the july plot he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters
he maintained hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers
this formed a key element of the myths speer encouraged
speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian populations survival
in reality he had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction germany suffered in the conflicts final months
speer maintained at the nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the holocaust
he admitted only to being uncomfortable around jews in the published version of the spandau diaries
in his final statement at nuremberg speer gave the impression of apologizing although he did not directly admit any personal guilt and the only victim he mentioned was the german people
historian martin kitchen states that speer was actually fully aware of what had happened to the jews and was intimately involved in the final solution
brechtken said speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility
speer was photographed with slave laborers at mauthausen concentration camp during a visit on march he also visited gusen concentration camp
although survivor francisco boix testified at the nuremberg trials about speers visit taylor writes that had the photo been available he would have been hanged
in the daily telegraph reported that documents had surfaced indicating that speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of auschwitz concentration camp after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand jews were massacred
heinrich breloer discussing the construction of auschwitz said speer was not just a cog in the work he was the terror itself
speer did not deny being present at the posen speeches to nazi leaders at a conference in posen on october but claimed to have left the auditorium before himmler said during his speech the grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth and later the jews must be exterminated
speer is mentioned several times in the speech and himmler addresses him directly
in the guardian reported that a letter from speer dated december had been found in a collection of his correspondence with hlne jeanty the widow of a belgian resistance fighter
in the letter speer says there is no doubt i was present as himmler announced on october that all jews would be killed
speer was credited with an armaments miracle
during the winter of in the light of germanys disastrous defeat in the battle of moscow the german leadership including friedrich fromm georg thomas and fritz todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won
the rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat
speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy
he produced spectacular statistics claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production a fourfold increase in artillery production and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country
he was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended
the armaments miracle was a myth speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims
the production of armaments did go up however this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before speer came to office the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity
by july speers armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the german public
little remains of speers personal architectural works other than the plans and photographs
no buildings designed by speer during the nazi era are extant in berlin other than the entrance pavilions and underpasses leading to the victory column or siegessule and the schwerbelastungskrper a heavy load bearing body built around
the concrete cylinder high was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumphal arch and other large structures planned within hitlers post war renewal project for the city of berlin as the world capital germania
the cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public
the tribune of the zeppelinfeld stadium in nuremberg though partly demolished can also be seen
during the war the speer designed new reich chancellery was largely destroyed by air raids and in the battle of berlin
the exterior walls survived but they were eventually dismantled by the soviets
unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the humboldt university mohrenstrae metro station and soviet war memorials in berlin
informational notes citations bibliography further reading the family asteraceae or by its original name compositae consists of over known species of flowering plants in over genera within the order asterales
commonly referred to as the aster daisy composite or sunflower family compositae were first described in the year
the number of species in asteraceae is rivaled only by the orchidaceae and which is the larger family is unclear as the quantity of extant species in each family is unknown
most species of asteraceae are annual biennial or perennial herbaceous plants but there are also shrubs vines and trees
the family has a widespread distribution from subpolar to tropical regions in a wide variety of habitats
most occur in hot desert and cold or hot semi desert climates and they are found on every continent but antarctica
their primary common characteristic is flower heads technically known as capitula consisting of sometimes hundreds of tiny individual florets enclosed by a whorl of protective involucral bracts
the oldest known fossils are pollen grains from the late cretaceous of antarctica dated to million years ago
it is estimated that the crown group of asteraceae evolved at least mya with a stem node age of mya
asteraceae is an economically important family providing food staples garden plants and herbal medicines
species outside of their native ranges can be considered weedy or invasive
members of the asteraceae are mostly herbaceous plants but some shrubs vines and trees do exist
asteraceae species are generally easy to distinguish from other plants because of their unique inflorescence and other shared characteristics such as the joined anthers of the stamens
nonetheless determining genera and species of some groups such as hieracium is notoriously difficult
members of the family asteraceae generally produce taproots but sometimes they possess fibrous root systems
some species have underground stems in the form of caudices or rhizomes
these can be fleshy or woody depending on the species
stems are herbaceous aerial branched and cylindrical with glandular hairs generally erect but can be prostrate to ascending
the stems can contain secretory canals with resin or latex which is particularly common among the cichorioideae
leaves can be alternate opposite or whorled
they may be simple but are often deeply lobed or otherwise incised often conduplicate or revolute
the margins also can be entire or toothed
resin or latex also can be present in the leaves
nearly all asteraceae bear their flowers in dense flower heads called capitula
they are surrounded by involucral bracts and when viewed from a distance each capitulum may appear to be a single flower
enlarged outer flowers in the capitulum may resemble petals and the involucral bracts may look like a calyx
in plants of the asteraceae what appears to be a single daisy type flower is actually a composite of several much smaller flowers known as the capitulum or head
by visually presenting as a single flower the capitulum functions in attracting pollinators in the same manner that other showy flowering plants in numerous other older plant families have evolved to attract pollinators
the previous name for the family compositae reflects the fact that what appears to be a single floral entity is in fact a composite of much smaller flowers
the petals or sunrays in an asteraceous head are in fact individual strap shaped flowers called ray flowers or ray florets and the sun disk is made up of smaller radially symmetric individual flowers called disc flowers or disc florets
the word aster means star in greek referring to the appearance of most family members as a celestial body with rays
the capitulum which often appears to be a single flower is often referred to as a head
in some species the entire head is able to pivot its floral stem in the course of the day to track the sun thus maximizing the reflectivity of the entire floral unit and further attracting flying pollinators
nearest to the flower stem lie a series of small usually green scale like bracts
these are known as phyllaries collectively they form the involucre which serves to protect the immature head of florets during its development
the individual florets are arranged atop a dome like structure called the receptacle
the individual florets in a head consist developmentally of five fused petals instead of sepals they have threadlike hairy or bristly structures known collectively as a pappus
the pappus surrounds the ovary and can when mature and attached to a seed adhere to animal fur or be carried by air currents aiding in seed dispersal
the whitish fluffy head of a dandelion commonly blown on by children consists of numerous seeds resting on the receptacle each seed attached to its pappus
the pappi provide a parachute like structure to help the seed travel from its point of origin to a more hospitable site
in the nervous system axons may be myelinated or unmyelinated
this is the provision of an insulating layer called a myelin sheath
the myelin membrane is unique in its relatively high lipid to protein ratio
in the peripheral nervous system axons are myelinated by glial cells known as schwann cells
in the central nervous system the myelin sheath is provided by another type of glial cell the oligodendrocyte
schwann cells myelinate a single axon
an oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to axons
the composition of myelin is different in the two types
in the cns the major myelin protein is proteolipid protein and in the pns it is myelin basic protein
nodes of ranvier are short unmyelinated segments of a myelinated axon which are found periodically interspersed between segments of the myelin sheath
therefore at the point of the node of ranvier the axon is reduced in diameter
these nodes are areas where action potentials can be generated
in saltatory conduction electrical currents produced at each node of ranvier are conducted with little attenuation to the next node in line where they remain strong enough to generate another action potential
thus in a myelinated axon action potentials effectively jump from node to node bypassing the myelinated stretches in between resulting in a propagation speed much faster than even the fastest unmyelinated axon can sustain
an axon can divide into many branches called telodendria
at the end of each telodendron is an axon terminal
axon terminals contain synaptic vesicles that store the neurotransmitter for release at the synapse
this makes multiple synaptic connections with other neurons possible
sometimes the axon of a neuron may synapse onto dendrites of the same neuron when it is known as an autapse
most axons carry signals in the form of action potentials which are discrete electrochemical impulses that travel rapidly along an axon starting at the cell body and terminating at points where the axon makes synaptic contact with target cells
the defining characteristic of an action potential is that it is all or nothingevery action potential that an axon generates has essentially the same size and shape
this all or nothing characteristic allows action potentials to be transmitted from one end of a long axon to the other without any reduction in size
there are however some types of neurons with short axons that carry graded electrochemical signals of variable amplitude
when an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal it activates the synaptic transmission process
the first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane
the resulting increase in intracellular calcium concentration causes synaptic vesicles filled with a neurotransmitter chemical to fuse with the axons membrane and empty their contents into the extracellular space
the neurotransmitter is released from the presynaptic nerve through exocytosis
the neurotransmitter chemical then diffuses across to receptors located on the membrane of the target cell
the neurotransmitter binds to these receptors and activates them
depending on the type of receptors that are activated the effect on the target cell can be to excite the target cell inhibit it or alter its metabolism in some way
this entire sequence of events often takes place in less than a thousandth of a second
afterward inside the presynaptic terminal a new set of vesicles is moved into position next to the membrane ready to be released when the next action potential arrives
the action potential is the final electrical step in the integration of synaptic messages at the scale of the neuron
extracellular recordings of action potential propagation in axons has been demonstrated in freely moving animals
while extracellular somatic action potentials have been used to study cellular activity in freely moving animals such as place cells axonal activity in both white and gray matter can also be recorded
extracellular recordings of axon action potential propagation is distinct from somatic action potentials in three ways
the signal has a shorter peak trough duration than of pyramidal cells or interneurons
the voltage change is triphasic
activity recorded on a tetrode is seen on only one of the four recording wires
in recordings from freely moving rats axonal signals have been isolated in white matter tracts including the alveus and the corpus callosum as well hippocampal gray matter
in fact the generation of action potentials in vivo is sequential in nature and these sequential spikes constitute the digital codes in the neurons
although previous studies indicate an axonal origin of a single spike evoked by short term pulses physiological signals in vivo trigger the initiation of sequential spikes at the cell bodies of the neurons
in addition to propagating action potentials to axonal terminals the axon is able to amplify the action potentials which makes sure a secure propagation of sequential action potentials toward the axonal terminal
in terms of molecular mechanisms voltage gated sodium channels in the axons possess lower threshold and shorter refractory period in response to short term pulses
the development of the axon to its target is one of the six major stages in the overall development of the nervous system
studies done on cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that neurons initially produce multiple neurites that are equivalent yet only one of these neurites is destined to become the axon
it is unclear whether axon specification precedes axon elongation or vice versa although recent evidence points to the latter
if an axon that is not fully developed is cut the polarity can change and other neurites can potentially become the axon
this alteration of polarity only occurs when the axon is cut at least m shorter than the other neurites
after the incision is made the longest neurite will become the future axon and all the other neurites including the original axon will turn into dendrites
imposing an external force on a neurite causing it to elongate will make it become an axon
nonetheless axonal development is achieved through a complex interplay between extracellular signaling intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics
the extracellular signals that propagate through the extracellular matrix surrounding neurons play a prominent role in axonal development
these signaling molecules include proteins neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules
netrin a secreted protein functions in axon formation
when the unc netrin receptor is mutated several neurites are irregularly projected out of neurons and finally a single axon is extended anteriorly
the neurotrophic factorsnerve growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin are also involved in axon development and bind to trk receptors
the ganglioside converting enzyme plasma membrane ganglioside sialidase which is involved in the activation of trka at the tip of neutrites is required for the elongation of axons
pmgs asymmetrically distributes to the tip of the neurite that is destined to become the future axon
during axonal development the activity of pik is increased at the tip of destined axon
disrupting the activity of pik inhibits axonal development
activation of pik results in the production of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate which can cause significant elongation of a neurite converting it into an axon
as such the overexpression of phosphatases that dephosphorylate ptdins leads into the failure of polarization
the neurite with the lowest actin filament content will become the axon
pgms concentration and f actin content are inversely correlated when pgms becomes enriched at the tip of a neurite its f actin content is substantially decreased
in addition exposure to actin depolimerizing drugs and toxin b causes the formation of multiple axons
consequently the interruption of the actin network in a growth cone will promote its neurite to become the axon
growing axons move through their environment via the growth cone which is at the tip of the axon
the growth cone has a broad sheet like extension called a lamellipodium which contain protrusions called filopodia
the filopodia are the mechanism by which the entire process adheres to surfaces and explores the surrounding environment
actin plays a major role in the mobility of this system
environments with high levels of cell adhesion molecules create an ideal environment for axonal growth
this seems to provide a sticky surface for axons to grow along
examples of cams specific to neural systems include n cam tag an axonal glycoproteinand mag all of which are part of the immunoglobulin superfamily
another set of molecules called extracellular matrix adhesion molecules also provide a sticky substrate for axons to grow along
examples of these molecules include laminin fibronectin tenascin and perlecan
some of these are surface bound to cells and thus act as short range attractants or repellents
others are difusible ligands and thus can have long range effects
cells called guidepost cells assist in the guidance of neuronal axon growth
these cells that help axon guidance are typically other neurons that are sometimes immature
when the axon has completed its growth at its connection to the target the diameter of the axon can increase by up to five times depending on the speed of conduction required
it has also been discovered through research that if the axons of a neuron were damaged as long as the soma is not damaged the axons would regenerate and remake the synaptic connections with neurons with the help of guidepost cells
this is also referred to as neuroregeneration
nogo a is a type of neurite outgrowth inhibitory component that is present in the central nervous system myelin membranes
it has a crucial role in restricting axonal regeneration in adult mammalian central nervous system
in recent studies if nogo a is blocked and neutralized it is possible to induce long distance axonal regeneration which leads to enhancement of functional recovery in rats and mouse spinal cord
this has yet to be done on humans
a recent study has also found that macrophages activated through a specific inflammatory pathway activated by the dectin receptor are capable of promoting axon recovery also however causing neurotoxicity in the neuron
axons vary largely in length from a few micrometers up to meters in some animals
this emphasizes that there must be a cellular length regulation mechanism allowing the neurons both to sense the length of their axons and to control their growth accordingly
it was discovered that motor proteins play an important role in regulating the length of axons
based on this observation researchers developed an explicit model for axonal growth describing how motor proteins could affect the axon length on the molecular level
these studies suggest that motor proteins carry signaling molecules from the soma to the growth cone and vice versa whose concentration oscillates in time with a length dependent frequency
the axons of neurons in the human peripheral nervous system can be classified based on their physical features and signal conduction properties
axons were known to have different thicknesses and these differences were thought to relate to the speed at which an action potential could travel along the axonits conductance velocity
erlanger and gasser proved this hypothesis and identified several types of nerve fiber establishing a relationship between the diameter of an axon and its nerve conduction velocity
they published their findings in giving the first classification of axons
axons are classified in two systems
the first one introduced by erlanger and gasser grouped the fibers into three main groups using the letters a b and c
these groups group a group b and group c include both the sensory fibers and the motor fibers
the first group a was subdivided into alpha beta gamma and delta fibersa a a and a
the motor neurons of the different motor fibers were the lower motor neuronsalpha motor neuron beta motor neuron and gamma motor neuron having the a a and a nerve fibers respectively
later findings by other researchers identified two groups of aa fibers that were sensory fibers
these were then introduced into a system that only included sensory fibers
this system refers to the sensory groups as types and uses roman numerals type ia type ib type ii type iii and type iv
different sensory receptors innervate different types of nerve fibers
proprioceptors are innervated by type ia ib and ii sensory fibers mechanoreceptors by type ii and iii sensory fibers and nociceptors and thermoreceptors by type iii and iv sensory fibers
in order of degree of severity injury to a nerve can be described as neurapraxia axonotmesis or neurotmesis
concussion is considered a mild form of diffuse axonal injury
axonal injury can also cause central chromatolysis
the dysfunction of axons in the nervous system is one of the major causes of many inherited neurological disorders that affect both peripheral and central neurons
when an axon is crushed an active process of axonal degeneration takes place at the part of the axon furthest from the cell body
this degeneration takes place quickly following the injury with the part of the axon being sealed off at the membranes and broken down by macrophages
this is known as wallerian degeneration
dying back of an axon can also take place in many neurodegenerative diseases particularly when axonal transport is impaired this is known as wallerian like degeneration
studies suggest that the degeneration happens as a result of the axonal protein nmnat being prevented from reaching all of the axon
demyelination of axons causes the multitude of neurological symptoms found in the disease multiple sclerosis
dysmyelination is the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath
this is implicated in several leukodystrophies and also in schizophrenia
a severe traumatic brain injury can result in widespread lesions to nerve tracts damaging the axons in a condition known as diffuse axonal injury
this can lead to a persistent vegetative state
it has been shown in studies on the rat that axonal damage from a single mild traumatic brain injury can leave a susceptibility to further damage after repeated mild traumatic brain injuries
a nerve guidance conduit is an artificial means of guiding axon growth to enable neuroregeneration and is one of the many treatments used for different kinds of nerve injury
some general dictionaries define nerve fiber as any neuronal process including both axons and dendrites
however medical sources generally use nerve fiber to refer to the axon only
german anatomist otto friedrich karl deiters is generally credited with the discovery of the axon by distinguishing it from the dendrites
swiss rdolf albert von klliker and german robert remak were the first to identify and characterize the axon initial segment
klliker named the axon in
louis antoine ranvier was the first to describe the gaps or nodes found on axons and for this contribution these axonal features are now commonly referred to as the nodes of ranvier
santiago ramn y cajal a spanish anatomist proposed that axons were the output components of neurons describing their functionality
joseph erlanger and herbert gasser earlier developed the classification system for peripheral nerve fibers based on axonal conduction velocity myelination fiber size etc
alan hodgkin and andrew huxley also employed the squid giant axon and by they had obtained a full quantitative description of the ionic basis of the action potential leading to the formulation of the hodgkin huxley model
hodgkin and huxley were awarded jointly the nobel prize for this work in
the formulae detailing axonal conductance were extended to vertebrates in the frankenhaeuser huxley equations
the understanding of the biochemical basis for action potential propagation has advanced further and includes many details about individual ion channels
the axons in invertebrates have been extensively studied
the longfin inshore squid often used as a model organism has the longest known axon
the giant squid has the largest axon known
its size ranges from to mm in diameter and is used in the control of its jet propulsion system
the fastest recorded conduction speed of m s is found in the ensheathed axons of some pelagic penaeid shrimps and the usual range is between and meters s in other cases as seen in rat studies an axon originates from a dendrite such axons are said to have dendritic origin
some axons with dendritic origin similarly have a proximal initial segment that starts directly at the axon origin while others have a distal initial segment discernibly separated from the axon origin
in many species some of the neurons have axons that emanate from the dendrite and not from the cell body and these are known as axon carrying dendrites
in many cases an axon originates at an axon hillock on the soma such axons are said to have somatic origin
some axons with somatic origin have a proximal initial segment adjacent the axon hillock while others have a distal initial segment separated from the soma by an extended axon hillock
the ancient aramaic alphabet was adapted by arameans from the phoenician alphabet and became a distinct script by the th century bc
it was used to write the aramaic languages spoken by ancient aramean pre christian tribes throughout the fertile crescent
it was also adopted by other peoples as their own alphabet when empires and their subjects underwent linguistic aramaization during a language shift for governing purposes a precursor to arabization centuries later including among assyrians who permanently replaced their akkadian language and its cuneiform script with aramaic and its script and among jews who adopted the aramaic language as their vernacular and started using the aramaic alphabet even for writing hebrew displacing the former paleo hebrew alphabet
the letters in the aramaic alphabet all represent consonants some of which are also used as matres lectionis to indicate long vowels
the aramaic alphabet is historically significant since virtually all modern middle eastern writing systems can be traced back to it
that is primarily due to the widespread usage of the aramaic language after it was adopted as both a lingua franca and the official language of the neo assyrian and neo babylonian empires and their successor the achaemenid empire
among the descendant scripts in modern use the jewish hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the imperial aramaic script of the th century bc with an identical letter inventory and for the most part nearly identical letter shapes
by contrast the samaritan hebrew script is directly descended from proto hebrew phoenician script which was in turn the ancestor of the aramaic alphabet
the aramaic alphabet was also an ancestor to the nabataean alphabet which in turn had the arabic alphabet as a descendant
writing systems that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of matres lectionis or added diacritical signs have been called abjads by peter t
daniels to distinguish them from alphabets such as the greek alphabet that represent vowels more systematically
the term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet which would imply that a system like aramaic must be either a syllabary or an incomplete or deficient alphabet
rather daniels put forward this is a different type of writing system intermediate between syllabaries and full alphabets
the earliest inscriptions in the aramaic language use the phoenician alphabet
over time the alphabet developed into the form shown below
aramaic gradually became the lingua franca throughout the middle east with the script at first complementing and then displacing assyrian cuneiform as the predominant writing system
around bc following the achaemenid conquest of mesopotamia under darius i old aramaic was adopted by the persians as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast persian empire with its different peoples and languages
the use of a single official language which modern scholarship has dubbed as official aramaic imperial aramaic or achaemenid aramaic can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the achaemenid persians in holding their far flung empire together for as long as they did
imperial aramaic was highly standardised its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was influenced by old persian
the aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles the lapidary form usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to phoenician and early aramaic
both were in use through the achaemenid persian period but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary which had largely disappeared by the rd century bc
for centuries after the fall of the achaemenid empire in bc imperial aramaic or something near enough to it to be recognisable would remain an influence on the various native iranian languages
the aramaic script would survive as the essential characteristics of the iranian pahlavi writing system
aramaic documents from bactria have been recently discovered an analysis of which was published in november
the texts which were rendered on leather reflect the use of aramaic in the th century bc in the persian achaemenid administration of bactria and sogdiana
the widespread usage of achaemenid aramaic in the middle east led to the gradual adoption of the aramaic alphabet for writing hebrew
formerly hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of phoenician the paleo hebrew alphabet
since the evolution of the aramaic alphabet out of the phoenician one was a gradual process the division of the worlds alphabets into the ones derived from the phoenician one directly and the ones derived from phoenician via aramaic is somewhat artificial
in general the alphabets of the mediterranean region are classified as phoenician derived adapted from around the th century bc and those of the east are considered aramaic derived adapted from around the th century bc from the imperial aramaic script of the achaemenid empire
after the fall of the achaemenid empire the unity of the imperial aramaic script was lost diversifying into a number of descendant cursives
the hebrew and nabataean alphabets as they stood by the roman era were little changed in style from the imperial aramaic alphabet
ibn khaldun alleges that not only the old nabataean writing was influenced by the syrian script but also the old chaldean script
a cursive hebrew variant developed from the early centuries ad but it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive
by contrast the cursive developed out of the nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing arabic evolving into the arabic alphabet as it stood by the time of the early spread of islam
the development of cursive versions of aramaic also led to the creation of the syriac palmyrene and mandaic alphabets which formed the basis of the historical scripts of central asia such as the sogdian and mongolian alphabets
the old turkic script is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in aramaic in particular via the pahlavi or sogdian alphabets as suggested by v
thomsen or possibly via kharosthi
brahmi script was also possibly derived or inspired by aramaic
brahmic family of scripts includes devanagari
today biblical aramaic jewish neo aramaic dialects and the aramaic language of the talmud are written in the modern hebrew alphabet
in classical jewish literature the name given to the modern hebrew script was ashurit a script now known widely as the aramaic script
it is believed that during the period of assyrian dominion that aramaic script and language received official status
syriac and christian neo aramaic dialects are today written in the syriac alphabet which script has superseded the more ancient assyrian script and now bears its name
mandaic is written in the mandaic alphabet
the near identical nature of the aramaic and the classical hebrew alphabets caused aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard hebrew script in scholarly literature
in maaloula one of few surviving communities in which a western aramaic dialect is still spoken an aramaic institute was established in by damascus university that teaches courses to keep the language alive
the institutes activities were suspended in amidst fears that the square aramaic alphabet used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the hebrew alphabet and all the signs with the square aramaic script were taken down
the program stated that they would instead use the more distinct syriac alphabet although use of the aramaic alphabet has continued to some degree
al jazeera arabic also broadcast a program about western neo aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use
in aramaic writing waw and yodh serve a double function
originally they represented only the consonants w and y but they were later adopted to indicate the long vowels and respectively as well
in the latter role they are known as or mothers of reading
lap likewise has some of the characteristics of a because in initial positions it indicates a glottal stop but otherwise it often also stands for the long vowels or
among jews the influence of hebrew often led to the use of h instead at the end of a word
the practice of using certain letters to hold vowel values spread to aramaic derived writing systems such as in arabic and hebrew which still follow the practice
the imperial aramaic alphabet was added to the unicode standard in october with the release of version the syriac aramaic alphabet was added to the unicode standard in september with the release of version the syriac abbreviation can be represented with a special control character called the syriac abbreviation mark
the unicode block for syriac aramaic is u uf american shot or cowboy shot is a translation of a phrase from french film criticism and refers to a medium long film shot of a group of characters who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera
the usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others
the purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position
in some literature this is simply referred to as a shot
one of the other main reasons why french critics called it american shot was its frequent use in the western genre
this was because a shot that started at knee level would reveal the weapon of a cowboy usually holstered at their waist
it is actually the closest the camera can get to an actor while keeping both their face and their holstered gun in frame
the french critics thought it was characteristic of american films of the s or s however it was mostly characteristic of cheaper american movies such as charlie chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago
howard hawks legitimized this style in his films allowing characters to act even when not talking when most of the audience would not be paying attention
it became his trademark style
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord
as well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed adem also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation which as a result destroys the white matter
the cause is often a trigger such as from viral infection or vaccinations
adems symptoms resemble the symptoms of multiple sclerosis so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases
however adem has several features that distinguish it from ms
unlike ms adem occurs usually in children and is marked with rapid fever although adolescents and adults can get the disease too
adem consists of a single flare up whereas ms is marked with several flare ups over a long period of time
relapses following adem are reported in up to a quarter of patients but the majority of these multiphasic presentations following adem likely represent ms
adem is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness coma and death which is very rare in ms except in severe cases
it affects about per people per year
although it occurs in all ages most reported cases are in children and adolescents with the average age around to years old
the disease affects males and females almost equally
adem shows seasonal variation with higher incidence in winter and spring months which may coincide with higher viral infections during these months
the mortality rate may be as high as however full recovery is seen in to of cases with increase in survival rates up to to with figures including minor residual disability as well
the average time to recover from adem flare ups is one to six months
adem produces multiple inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord particularly in the white matter
usually these are found in the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray white junction of both cerebral hemispheres cerebellum brainstem and spinal cord but periventricular white matter and gray matter of the cortex thalami and basal ganglia may also be involved
when a person has more than one demyelinating episode of adem the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis
also a fulminant course in adults has been described
adem has an abrupt onset and a monophasic course
symptoms usually begin weeks after infection
major symptoms include fever headache nausea and vomiting confusion vision impairment drowsiness seizures and coma
although initially the symptoms are usually mild they worsen rapidly over the course of hours to days with the average time to maximum severity being about four and a half days
additional symptoms include hemiparesis paraparesis and cranial nerve palsies
neurological symptoms were the main presentation of covid which did not correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms
the high incidence of adem with hemorrhage is striking
brain inflammation is likely caused by an immune response to the disease rather than neurotropism
csf analysis was not indicative of an infectious process neurological impairment was not present in the acute phase of the infection and neuroimaging findings were not typical of classical toxic and metabolic disorders
the finding of bilateral periventricular relatively asymmetrical lesions allied with deep white matter involvement that may also be present in cortical gray white matter junction thalami basal ganglia cerebellum and brainstem suggests an acute demyelination process
additionally hemorrhagic white matter lesions clusters of macrophages related to axonal injury and adem like appearance were also found in subcortical white matter
since the discovery of the anti mog specificity against multiple sclerosis diagnosis it is considered that adem is one of the possible clinical causes of anti mog associated encephalomyelitis
the term adem has been inconsistently used at different times
currently the commonly accepted international standard for the clinical case definition is the one published by the international pediatric ms study group revision
given that the definition is clinical it is currently unknown if all the cases of adem are positive for anti mog autoantibody in any case it appears to be strongly related to adem diagnosis
while adem and ms both involve autoimmune demyelination they differ in many clinical genetic imaging and histopathological aspects
some authors consider ms and its borderline forms to constitute a spectrum differing only in chronicity severity and clinical course while others consider them discretely different diseases
typically adem appears in children following an antigenic challenge and remains monophasic
nevertheless adem does occur in adults and can also be clinically multiphasic
problems for differential diagnosis increase due to the lack of agreement for a definition of multiple sclerosis
if ms were defined only by the separation in time and space of the demyelinating lesions as mcdonald did it would not be enough to make a difference as some cases of adem satisfy these conditions
therefore some authors propose to establish the dividing line as the shape of the lesions around the veins being therefore perivenous vs
confluent demyelination
the pathology of adem is very similar to that of ms with some differences
the pathological hallmark of adem is perivenous inflammation with limited sleeves of demyelination
nevertheless ms like plaques can appear plaques in the white matter in ms are sharply delineated while the glial scar in adem is smooth
axons are better preserved in adem lesions
inflammation in adem is widely disseminated and ill defined and finally lesions are strictly perivenous while in ms they are disposed around veins but not so sharply
nevertheless the co occurrence of perivenous and confluent demyelination in some individuals suggests pathogenic overlap between acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis and misclassification even with biopsy or even postmortem adem in adults can progress to ms when the person has more than one demyelinating episode of adem the disease is then called recurrent disseminated encephalomyelitis or multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis
it has been found that anti mog auto antibodies are related to this kind of adem another variant of adem in adults has been described also related to anti mog auto antibodies has been named fulminant disseminated encephalomyelitis and it has been reported to be clinically adem but showing ms like lesions on autopsy
it has been classified inside the anti mog associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases
acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis weston hurst syndrome or hursts disease is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of adem
ahl is relatively rare it is seen in about of adem cases and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage and edema
death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids immunoglobulins cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange
about of survivors show residual neurological deficits but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the extent of the white matter affected
this disease has been occasionally associated with ulcerative colitis and crohns disease malaria sepsis associated with immune complex deposition methanol poisoning and other underlying conditions
also anecdotal association with ms has been reported laboratory studies that support diagnosis of ahl are peripheral leukocytosis cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis associated with normal glucose and increased protein
on magnetic resonance imaging lesions of ahl typically show extensive t weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery white matter hyperintensities with areas of hemorrhages significant edema and mass effect
no controlled clinical trials have been conducted on adem treatment but aggressive treatment aimed at rapidly reducing inflammation of the cns is standard
the widely accepted first line treatment is high doses of intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone followed by weeks of gradually lower oral doses of prednisolone
patients treated with methylprednisolone have shown better outcomes than those treated with dexamethasone
oral tapers of less than three weeks duration show a higher chance of relapsing and tend to show poorer outcomes
other anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies have been reported to show beneficial effect such as plasmapheresis high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide
these are considered alternative therapies used when corticosteroids cannot be used or fail to show an effect
there is some evidence to suggest that patients may respond to a combination of methylprednisolone and immunoglobulins if they fail to respond to either separately in a study of children with adem recovered completely after high dose methylprednisolone one severe case that failed to respond to steroids recovered completely after iv ig the five most severe cases with adam and severe peripheral neuropathy were treated with combined high dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin two remained paraplegic one had motor and cognitive handicaps and two recovered
a recent review of ivig treatment of adem found that of children showed complete recovery after treatment with ivig or ivig plus corticosteroids
a study of ivig treatment in adults with adem showed that ivig seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition consciousness and rigor
this same study found one subject a year old man who had not responded to steroids that responded to an ivig treatment days after disease onset
full recovery is seen in to of cases ranging to to recovery with some minor residual disability average time to recover is one to six months
the mortality rate may be as high as
poorer outcomes are associated with unresponsiveness to steroid therapy unusually severe neurological symptoms or sudden onset
children tend to have more favorable outcomes than adults and cases presenting without fevers tend to have poorer outcomes
the latter effect may be due to either protective effects of fever or that diagnosis and treatment is sought more rapidly when fever is present
adem can progress to ms
it will be considered ms if some lesions appear in different times and brain areas residual motor deficits are estimated to remain in about to of cases the range in severity from mild clumsiness to ataxia and hemiparesis
patients with demyelinating illnesses such as ms have shown cognitive deficits even when there is minimal physical disability
research suggests that similar effects are seen after adem but that the deficits are less severe than those seen in ms
a study of six children with adem were tested for a range of neurocognitive tests after an average of years of recovery
all six children performed in the normal range on most tests including verbal iq and performance iq but performed at least one standard deviation below age norms in at least one cognitive domain such as complex attention short term memory and internalizing behaviour affect
group means for each cognitive domain were all within one standard deviation of age norms demonstrating that as a group they were normal
these deficits were less severe than those seen in similar aged children with a diagnosis of ms
another study compared nineteen children with a history of adem of which were five years of age or younger at the time and nine were older to nineteen matched controls
scores on iq tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset adem group compared to the late onset and control groups while the late onset adem children scored lower on verbal processing speed
again all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls meaning that while effects were statistically reliable the children were as a whole still within the normal range
there were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group although there is some suggestion that this may be due at least in part to the stress of hospitalization at a young age
the relationship between adem and anti mog associated encephalomyelitis is currently under research
a new entity called mogdem has been proposed
about animal models the main animal model for ms experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is also an animal model for adem
being an acute monophasic illness eae is far more similar to adem than ms
ataxia is a neurological sign consisting of lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements that can include gait abnormality speech changes and abnormalities in eye movements that indicates dysfunction of parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement such as the cerebellum
these nervous system dysfunctions occur in several different patterns with different results and different possible causes
ataxia can be limited to one side of the body which is referred to as hemiataxia
friedreichs ataxia has gait abnormality as the most commonly presented symptom
dystaxia is a mild degree of ataxia
the term cerebellar ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the cerebellum
the cerebellum is responsible for integrating a significant amount of neural information that is used to coordinate smoothly ongoing movements and to participate in motor planning
although ataxia is not present with all cerebellar lesions many conditions affecting the cerebellum do produce ataxia
people with cerebellar ataxia may have trouble regulating the force range direction velocity and rhythm of muscle contractions
this results in a characteristic type of irregular uncoordinated movement that can manifest itself in many possible ways such as asthenia asynergy delayed reaction time and dyschronometria
individuals with cerebellar ataxia could also display instability of gait difficulty with eye movements dysarthria dysphagia hypotonia dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia
these deficits can vary depending on which cerebellar structures have been damaged and whether the lesion is bi or unilateral
people with cerebellar ataxia may initially present with poor balance which could be demonstrated as an inability to stand on one leg or perform tandem gait
as the condition progresses walking is characterized by a widened base and high stepping as well as staggering and lurching from side to side
turning is also problematic and could result in falls
as cerebellar ataxia becomes severe great assistance and effort are needed to stand and walk
dysarthria an impairment with articulation may also be present and is characterized by scanning speech that consists of slower rate irregular rhythm and variable volume
also slurring of speech tremor of the voice and ataxic respiration may occur
cerebellar ataxia could result with incoordination of movement particularly in the extremities
overshooting occurs with finger to nose testing and heel to shin testing thus dysmetria is evident
impairments with alternating movements as well as dysrhythmia may also be displayed
tremor of the head and trunk may be seen in individuals with cerebellar ataxia
dysmetria is thought to be caused by a deficit in the control of interaction torques in multijoint motion
interaction torques are created at an associated joint when the primary joint is moved
for example if a movement required reaching to touch a target in front of the body flexion at the shoulder would create a torque at the elbow while extension of the elbow would create a torque at the wrist
these torques increase as the speed of movement increases and must be compensated and adjusted for to create coordinated movement
this may therefore explain decreased coordination at higher movement velocities and accelerations
the term sensory ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to loss of proprioception the loss of sensitivity to the positions of joint and body parts
this is generally caused by dysfunction of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord because they carry proprioceptive information up to the brain
in some cases the cause of sensory ataxia may instead be dysfunction of the various parts of the brain that receive positional information including the cerebellum thalamus and parietal lobes
sensory ataxia presents itself with an unsteady stomping gait with heavy heel strikes as well as a postural instability that is usually worsened when the lack of proprioceptive input cannot be compensated for by visual input such as in poorly lit environments
physicians can find evidence of sensory ataxia during physical examination by having patients stand with their feet together and eyes shut
in affected patients this will cause the instability to worsen markedly producing wide oscillations and possibly a fall this is called a positive rombergs test
worsening of the finger pointing test with the eyes closed is another feature of sensory ataxia
also when patients are standing with arms and hands extended toward the physician if the eyes are closed the patients fingers tend to fall down and then be restored to the horizontal extended position by sudden muscular contractions
the term vestibular ataxia is used to indicate ataxia due to dysfunction of the vestibular system which in acute and unilateral cases is associated with prominent vertigo nausea and vomiting
in slow onset chronic bilateral cases of vestibular dysfunction these characteristic manifestations may be absent and dysequilibrium may be the sole presentation
the three types of ataxia have overlapping causes so can either coexist or occur in isolation
cerebellar ataxia can have many causes despite normal neuroimaging
any type of focal lesion of the central nervous system will cause the type of ataxia corresponding to the site of the lesion cerebellar if in the cerebellum sensory if in the dorsal spinal cord
to include cord compression by thickened ligamentum flavum or stenosis of the boney spinal canal
or vestibular if in the vestibular system
exogenous substances that cause ataxia mainly do so because they have a depressant effect on central nervous system function
the most common example is ethanol which is capable of causing reversible cerebellar and vestibular ataxia
chronic intake of ethanol causes atrophy of the cerebellum by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stresses induced by thiamine deficiency
other examples include various prescription drugs lithium level over meq l synthetic cannabinoid hu ingestion and various other medical and recreational drugs
a further class of pharmaceuticals which can cause short term ataxia especially in high doses are benzodiazepines
exposure to high levels of methylmercury through consumption of fish with high mercury concentrations is also a known cause of ataxia and other neurological disorders
ataxia can be induced as a result of severe acute radiation poisoning with an absorbed dose of more than grays
vitamin b deficiency may cause among several neurological abnormalities overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia
neuropsychological symptoms may include sense loss difficulty in proprioception poor balance loss of sensation in the feet changes in reflexes dementia and psychosis can be reversible with treatment
complications may include a neurological complex known as subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord and other neurological disorders
symptoms of neurological dysfunction may be the presenting feature in some patients with hypothyroidism
these include reversible cerebellar ataxia dementia peripheral neuropathy psychosis and coma
most of the neurological complications improve completely after thyroid hormone replacement therapy
peripheral neuropathies may cause generalised or localised sensory ataxia depending on the extent of the neuropathic involvement
spinal disorders of various types may cause sensory ataxia from the lesioned level below when they involve the dorsal columns
non hereditary causes of cerebellar degeneration include chronic alcohol use disorder head injury paraneoplastic and non paraneoplastic autoimmune ataxia high altitude cerebral oedema coeliac disease normal pressure hydrocephalus and infectious or post infectious cerebellitis
ataxia may depend on hereditary disorders consisting of degeneration of the cerebellum or of the spine most cases feature both to some extent and therefore present with overlapping cerebellar and sensory ataxia even though one is often more evident than the other
hereditary disorders causing ataxia include autosomal dominant ones such as spinocerebellar ataxia episodic ataxia and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy as well as autosomal recessive disorders such as friedreichs ataxia and niemann pick disease ataxia telangiectasia autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia and abetalipoproteinaemia
an example of x linked ataxic condition is the rare fragile x associated tremor ataxia syndrome or fxtas
arnold chiari malformation is a malformation of the brain
it consists of a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla through the foramen magnum sometimes causing hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow
succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is an autosomal recessive gene disorder where mutations in the aldha gene results in the accumulation of gamma hydroxybutyric acid in the body
ghb accumulates in the nervous system and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological dysfunction
wilsons disease is an autosomal recessive gene disorder whereby an alteration of the atpb gene results in an inability to properly excrete copper from the body
copper accumulates in the nervous system and liver and can cause ataxia as well as other neurological and organ impairments
gluten ataxia is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten
early diagnosis and treatment with a gluten free diet can improve ataxia and prevent its progression
the effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis because the death of neurons in the cerebellum as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible
it accounts for of ataxias of unknown origin and of all ataxias
less than of people with gluten ataxia present any gastrointestinal symptom and only about have intestinal damage
this entity is classified into primary auto immune cerebellar ataxias
malfunction of the sodium potassium pump may be a factor in some ataxias
the pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar purkinje neurons
this suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic housekeeping molecule for ionic gradients but could be a computational element in the cerebellum and the brain
indeed an ouabain block of pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia
ataxia is observed for lower ouabain concentrations dystonia is observed at higher ouabain concentrations
antibodies against the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase cause cerebellar deficits
the antibodies impair motor learning and cause behavioral deficits
gad antibodies related ataxia is part of the group called immune mediated cerebellar ataxias
the antibodies induce a synaptopathy
the cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to autoimmune disorders
cerebellar circuitry has capacities to compensate and restore function thanks to cerebellar reserve gathering multiple forms of plasticity
ltdpathies gather immune disorders targeting long term depression a form of plasticity
the treatment of ataxia and its effectiveness depend on the underlying cause
treatment may limit or reduce the effects of ataxia but it is unlikely to eliminate them entirely
recovery tends to be better in individuals with a single focal injury compared to those who have a neurological degenerative condition
a review of the management of degenerative ataxia was published in
a small number of rare conditions presenting with prominent cerebellar ataxia are amenable to specific treatment and recognition of these disorders is critical
diseases include vitamin e deficiency abetalipoproteinemia cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis niemann pick type c disease refsums disease glucose transporter type deficiency episodic ataxia type gluten ataxia glutamic acid decarboxylase ataxia
novel therapies target the rna defects associated with cerebellar disorders using in particular anti sense oligonucleotides
the movement disorders associated with ataxia can be managed by pharmacological treatments and through physical therapy and occupational therapy to reduce disability
some drug treatments that have been used to control ataxia include hydroxytryptophan idebenone amantadine physostigmine l carnitine or derivatives trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole vigabatrin phosphatidylcholine acetazolamide aminopyridine buspirone and a combination of coenzyme q and vitamin e
physical therapy requires a focus on adapting activity and facilitating motor learning for retraining specific functional motor patterns
a recent systematic review suggested that physical therapy is effective but there is only moderate evidence to support this conclusion
the most commonly used physical therapy interventions for cerebellar ataxia are vestibular habituation frenkel exercises proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and balance training however therapy is often highly individualized and gait and coordination training are large components of therapy
current research suggests that if a person is able to walk with or without a mobility aid physical therapy should include an exercise program addressing five components static balance dynamic balance trunk limb coordination stairs and contracture prevention
once the physical therapist determines that the individual is able to safely perform parts of the program independently it is important that the individual be prescribed and regularly engage in a supplementary home exercise program that incorporates these components to further improve long term outcomes
these outcomes include balance tasks gait and individual activities of daily living
while the improvements are attributed primarily to changes in the brain and not just the hip or ankle joints it is still unknown whether the improvements are due to adaptations in the cerebellum or compensation by other areas of the brain
decomposition simplification or slowing of multijoint movement may also be an effective strategy that therapists may use to improve function in patients with ataxia
training likely needs to be intense and focused as indicated by one study performed with stroke patients experiencing limb ataxia who underwent intensive upper limb retraining
their therapy consisted of constraint induced movement therapy which resulted in improvements of their arm function
treatment should likely include strategies to manage difficulties with everyday activities such as walking
gait aids can be provided to decrease the risk of falls associated with impairment of balance or poor coordination
severe ataxia may eventually lead to the need for a wheelchair
to obtain better results possible coexisting motor deficits need to be addressed in addition to those induced by ataxia
for example muscle weakness and decreased endurance could lead to increasing fatigue and poorer movement patterns
there are several assessment tools available to therapists and health care professionals working with patients with ataxia
the international cooperative ataxia rating scale is one of the most widely used and has been proven to have very high reliability and validity
other tools that assess motor function balance and coordination are also highly valuable to help the therapist track the progress of their patient as well as to quantify the patients functionality
these tests include but are not limited to the term ataxia is sometimes used in a broader sense to indicate lack of coordination in some physiological process
examples include optic ataxia and ataxic respiration
optic ataxia may be caused by lesions to the posterior parietal cortex which is responsible for combining and expressing positional information and relating it to movement
outputs of the posterior parietal cortex include the spinal cord brain stem motor pathways pre motor and pre frontal cortex basal ganglia and the cerebellum
some neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are modulated by intention
optic ataxia is usually part of balints syndrome but can be seen in isolation with injuries to the superior parietal lobule as it represents a disconnection between visual association cortex and the frontal premotor and motor cortex
augusta ada king countess of lovelace was an english mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on charles babbages proposed mechanical general purpose computer the analytical engine
she was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation
ada byron was the only legitimate child of poet lord byron and lady byron
all of byrons other children were born out of wedlock to other women
byron separated from his wife a month after ada was born and left england forever
he died in greece when ada was eight
her mother remained bitter and promoted adas interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her fathers perceived insanity
despite this ada remained interested in him naming her two sons byron and gordon
upon her death she was buried next to him at her request
although often ill in her childhood ada pursued her studies assiduously
she married william king in
king was made earl of lovelace in ada thereby becoming countess of lovelace
her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as andrew crosse charles babbage sir david brewster charles wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens contacts which she used to further her education
ada described her approach as poetical science and herself as an analyst
when she was eighteen her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow british mathematician charles babbage who is known as the father of computers
she was in particular interested in babbages work on the analytical engine
lovelace first met him in june through their mutual friend and her private tutor mary somerville
between and ada translated by the military engineer luigi menabrea about the analytical engine supplementing it with
lovelaces notes are important in the early history of computers especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program that is an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine
other historians reject this perspective and point out that babbages personal notes from the years contain the first programs for the engine
she also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number crunching while many others including babbage himself focused only on those capabilities
her mindset of poetical science led her to ask questions about the analytical engine examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool
lord byron expected his child to be a glorious boy and was disappointed when lady byron gave birth to a girl
the child was named after byrons half sister augusta leigh and was called ada by byron himself
on january at lord byrons command lady byron left for her parents home at kirkby mallory taking their five week old daughter with her
although english law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation lord byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights but did request that his sister keep him informed of adas welfare
on april lord byron signed the deed of separation although very reluctantly and left england for good a few days later
aside from an acrimonious separation lady byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husbands immoral behaviour
this set of events made lovelace infamous in victorian society
ada did not have a relationship with her father
he died in when she was eight years old
her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life
lovelace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her th birthday
lovelace did not have a close relationship with her mother
she was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother judith hon
lady milbanke who doted on her
however because of societal attitudes of the time which favoured the husband in any separation with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation lady byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society
this included writing anxious letters to lady milbanke about her daughters welfare with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern
in one letter to lady milbanke she referred to her daughter as it i talk to it for your satisfaction not my own and shall be very glad when you have it under your own
lady byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation
lovelace dubbed these observers the furies and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her
lovelace was often ill beginning in early childhood
at the age of eight she experienced headaches that obscured her vision
in june she was paralyzed after a bout of measles
she was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year something which may have extended her period of disability
by she was able to walk with crutches
despite the illnesses she developed her mathematical and technological skills
ada byron had an affair with a tutor in early
she tried to elope with him after she was caught but the tutors relatives recognised her and contacted her mother
lady byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal
lovelace never met her younger half sister allegra the daughter of lord byron and claire clairmont
allegra died in at the age of five
lovelace did have some contact with elizabeth medora leigh the daughter of byrons half sister augusta leigh who purposely avoided lovelace as much as possible when introduced at court
lovelace became close friends with her tutor mary somerville who introduced her to charles babbage in
she had a strong respect and affection for somerville and they corresponded for many years
other acquaintances included the scientists andrew crosse sir david brewster charles wheatstone michael faraday and the author charles dickens
she was presented at court at the age of seventeen and became a popular belle of the season in part because of her brilliant mind
by ada was a regular at court and started attending various events
she danced often and was able to charm many people and was described by most people as being dainty although john hobhouse byrons friend described her as a large coarse skinned young woman but with something of my friends features particularly the mouth
this description followed their meeting on february in which ada made it clear to hobhouse that she did not like him probably due to her mothers influence which led her to dislike all of her fathers friends
this first impression was not to last and they later became friends
on july she married william th baron king becoming lady king
they had three homes ockham park surrey a scottish estate on loch torridon in ross shire and a house in london
they spent their honeymoon at worthy manor in ashley combe near porlock weir somerset
the manor had been built as a hunting lodge in and was improved by king in preparation for their honeymoon
it later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time
from the familys main house was horsley towers built in the tudorbethan fashion by the architect of the houses of parliament charles barry and later greatly enlarged to lovelaces own designs
they had three children byron anne isabella and ralph gordon
immediately after the birth of annabella lady king experienced a tedious and suffering illness which took months to cure
ada was a descendant of the extinct barons lovelace and in her husband was made earl of lovelace and viscount ockham meaning ada became the countess of lovelace
in adas mother assigned william benjamin carpenter to teach adas children and to act as a moral instructor for ada
he quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an unbecoming manner
when it became clear that carpenter was trying to start an affair ada cut it off
in lovelace and medora leigh were told by adas mother that adas father was also medoras father
on february ada wrote to her mother i am not in the least astonished
in fact you merely confirm what i have for years and years felt scarcely a doubt about but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that i in any way suspected
she did not blame the incestuous relationship on byron but instead blamed augusta leigh i fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was
in the s ada flirted with scandals firstly from a relaxed approach to extra marital relationships with men leading to rumours of affairs and secondly from her love of gambling
she apparently lost more than on the horses during the later s
the gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends and an ambitious attempt in to create a mathematical model for successful large bets
this went disastrously wrong leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate forcing her to admit it all to her husband
she had a shadowy relationship with andrew crosses son john from onwards
john crosse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement
she bequeathed him the only heirlooms her father had personally left to her
during her final illness she would panic at the idea of the younger crosse being kept from visiting her
from when she was seventeen her mathematical abilities began to emerge and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life
her mothers obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused byron was one of the reasons that ada was taught mathematics from an early age
she was privately educated in mathematics and science by william frend william king and mary somerville the noted th century researcher and scientific author
in the s the mathematician augustus de morgan extended her much help in her mathematical studies including study of advanced calculus topics including the numbers of bernoulli
in a letter to lady byron de morgan suggested that adas skill in mathematics might lead her to become an original mathematical investigator perhaps of first rate eminence
lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating poetry and science
whilst studying differential calculus she wrote to de morgan i may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight is i think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies
i am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of who are at ones elbows in one shape now and the next minute in a form most dissimilar
lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts
she valued metaphysics as much as mathematics viewing both as tools for exploring the unseen worlds around us
lovelace died at the age of on november from uterine cancer
the illness lasted several months in which time annabella took command over whom ada saw and excluded all of her friends and confidants
under her mothers influence ada had a religious transformation and was coaxed into repenting of her previous conduct and making annabella her executor
she lost contact with her husband after confessing something to him on august which caused him to abandon her bedside
it is not known what she told him
she was buried at her request next to her father at the church of st
mary magdalene in hucknall nottinghamshire
a memorial plaque written in latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to horsley towers
throughout her life lovelace was strongly interested in scientific developments and fads of the day including phrenology and mesmerism
after her work with babbage lovelace continued to work on other projects
in she commented to a friend woronzow greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings
she never achieved this however
in part her interest in the brain came from a long running pre occupation inherited from her mother about her potential madness
as part of her research into this project she visited the electrical engineer andrew crosse in to learn how to carry out electrical experiments
in the same year she wrote a review of a paper by baron karl von reichenbach researches on magnetism but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft
in the year before her cancer struck she wrote to her mother mentioning certain productions she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music
lovelace first met charles babbage in june through their mutual friend mary somerville
later that month babbage invited lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine
she became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with somerville to visit babbage as often as she could
babbage was impressed by lovelaces intellect and analytic skills
he called her the enchantress of number
in he wrote to her during a nine month period in lovelace translated the italian mathematician luigi menabreas article on babbages newest proposed machine the analytical engine
with the article she appended a set of notes
explaining the analytical engines function was a difficult task many other scientists did not grasp the concept and the british establishment had shown little interest in it
lovelaces notes even had to explain how the analytical engine differed from the original difference engine
her work was well received at the time the scientist michael faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing
the notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include in complete detail a method for calculating a sequence of bernoulli numbers using the analytical engine which might have run correctly had it ever been built
based on this work lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer and her method has been called the worlds first computer program
others dispute this because some of charles babbages earlier writings could be considered computer programs
note g also contains lovelaces dismissal of artificial intelligence
she wrote that the analytical engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything
it can do whatever we know how to order it to perform
it can follow analysis but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths
this objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal for example by alan turing in his paper computing machinery and intelligence
most modern computer scientists argue that this view is outdated and that computer software can develop in ways that cannot necessarily be anticipated by programmers
lovelace and babbage had a minor falling out when the papers were published when he tried to leave his own statement as an unsigned preface which could have been mistakenly interpreted as a joint declaration
when taylors scientific memoirs ruled that the statement should be signed babbage wrote to lovelace asking her to withdraw the paper
this was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper
the historian benjamin woolley theorised that his actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought adas involvement and so happily indulged her
because of her celebrated name
their friendship recovered and they continued to correspond
on august when she was dying of cancer lovelace wrote to him asking him to be her executor though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority
part of the terrace at worthy manor was known as philosophers walk it was there that lovelace and babbage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles
in babbage was invited to give a seminar at the university of turin about his analytical engine
luigi menabrea a young italian engineer and the future prime minister of italy transcribed babbages lecture into french and this transcript was subsequently published in the bibliothque universelle de genve in october
babbages friend charles wheatstone commissioned ada lovelace to translate menabreas paper into english
she then augmented the paper with notes which were added to the translation
ada lovelace spent the better part of a year doing this assisted with input from babbage
these notes which are more extensive than menabreas paper were then published in the september edition of taylors scientific memoirs under the initialism aal
ada lovelaces notes were labelled alphabetically from a to g
in note g she describes an algorithm for the analytical engine to compute bernoulli numbers
it is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer and ada lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason
the engine was never completed and so her program was never tested
in more than a century after her death ada lovelaces notes on babbages analytical engine were republished as an appendix to b
bowdens faster than thought a symposium on digital computing machines
the engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software
in her notes ada lovelace emphasised the difference between the analytical engine and previous calculating machines particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity
she realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching
in her notes she wrote this analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised
walter isaacson ascribes adas insight regarding the application of computing to any process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles when she saw some mechanical looms that used punchcards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns it reminded her of how babbages engine used punched cards to make calculations
this insight is seen as significant by writers such as betty toole and benjamin woolley as well as the programmer john graham cumming whose project plan has the aim of constructing the first complete analytical engine
ada saw something that babbage in some sense failed to see
in babbages world his engines were bound by number
what lovelace saw
was that number could represent entities other than quantity
so once you had a machine for manipulating numbers if those numbers represented other things letters musical notes then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance according to rules
it is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation to general purpose computation and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing if we are looking and sifting history for that transition then that transition was made explicitly by ada in that paper
lovelace recognized the difference between the details of the computing mechanism as covered in a article on the difference engine and the logical structure of the analytical engine on which the article she was reviewing dwelt
she noted that different specialists might be required in each area
the article chiefly treats it under its mechanical aspect entering but slightly into the mathematical principles of which that engine is the representative but giving in considerable length many details of the mechanism and contrivances by means of which it tabulates the various orders of differences
menabrea on the contrary exclusively developes the analytical view taking it for granted that mechanism is able to perform certain processes but without attempting to explain how and devoting his whole attention to explanations and illustrations of the manner in which analytical laws can be so arranged and combined as to bring every branch of that vast subject within the grasp of the assumed powers of mechanism
it is obvious that in the invention of a calculating engine these two branches of the subject are equally essential fields of investigation
they are indissolubly connected though so different in their intrinsic nature that perhaps the same mind might not be likely to prove equally profound or successful in both
though lovelace is often referred to as the first computer programmer some biographers computer scientists and historians of computing suggest otherwise
allan g
bromley in the article difference and analytical engines bruce collier wrote that lovelace made a considerable contribution to publicizing the analytical engine but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way
eugene eric kim and betty alexandra toole consider it incorrect to regard lovelace as the first computer programmer as babbage wrote the initial programs for his analytical engine although the majority were never published
bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by babbage between and all substantially predating lovelaces notes
dorothy k
stein regards lovelaces notes as more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author the political purposes of the inventor and above all of the social and cultural context in which it was written than a blueprint for a scientific development
doron swade has said that ada only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it but agrees that she was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities
in his book idea makers stephen wolfram defends lovelaces contributions
while acknowledging that babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the analytical engine prior to lovelaces notes wolfram argues that theres nothing as sophisticated or as clean as adas computation of the bernoulli numbers
babbage certainly helped and commented on adas work but she was definitely the driver of it
wolfram then suggests that lovelaces main achievement was to distill from babbages correspondence a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine something which babbage never did

august william derleth was an american writer and anthologist
he was the first book publisher of the writings of h
he made contributions to the cthulhu mythos and the cosmic horror genre and helped found the publisher arkham house
derleth was also a leading american regional writer of his day as well as prolific in several other genres including historical fiction poetry detective fiction science fiction and biography
a guggenheim fellow derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious sac prairie saga a series of fiction historical fiction poetry and non fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the wisconsin he knew
derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing
the son of william julius derleth and rose louise volk derleth grew up in sauk city wisconsin
he was educated in local parochial and public high school
derleth wrote his first fiction at age
he was interested most in reading and he made three trips to the library a week
he would save his money to buy books
some of his biggest influences were ralph waldo emersons essays walt whitman h
menckens the american mercury samuel johnsons the history of rasselas prince of abissinia alexandre dumas edgar allan poe walter scott and henry david thoreaus walden
forty rejected stories and three years later according to anthologist jim stephens he sold his first story bats belfry to weird tales magazine
derleth wrote throughout his four years at the university of wisconsin where he received a ba in
during this time he also served briefly as associate editor of minneapolis based fawcett publications mystic magazine
returning to sauk city in the summer of derleth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend mark schorer
they rented a cabin writing gothic and other horror stories and selling them to weird tales magazine
derleth won a place on the obrien roll of honor for five alone published in place of hawks but was first published in pagany magazine
as a result of his early work on the sac prairie saga derleth was awarded the prestigious guggenheim fellowship his sponsors were helen c
white nobel prize winning novelist sinclair lewis and poet edgar lee masters of spoon river anthology fame
in the mid s derleth organized a rangers club for young people served as clerk and president of the local school board served as a parole officer organized a local mens club and a parent teacher association
he also lectured in american regional literature at the university of wisconsin and was a contributing editor of outdoors magazine
with longtime friend donald wandrei derleth founded arkham house in
its initial objective was to publish the works of h
lovecraft with whom derleth had corresponded since his teenage years
at the same time he began teaching a course in american regional literature at the university of wisconsin
in he became literary editor of the capital times newspaper in madison a post he held until his resignation in
his hobbies included fencing swimming chess philately and comic strips
derleths true avocation however was hiking the terrain of his native wisconsin lands and observing and recording nature with an expert eye
derleth once wrote of his writing methods i write very swiftly from to a million words yearly very little of it pulp material
in he was elected president of the associated fantasy publishers at the th world science fiction convention in toronto
he was married april to sandra evelyn winters
they divorced six years later
derleth retained custody of the couples two children april rose derleth and walden william derleth
april earned a bachelor of arts degree in english from the university of wisconsin madison in
she became majority stockholder president and ceo of arkham house in
she remained in that capacity until her death
she was known in the community as a naturalist and humanitarian
april died on march
in derleth began editing and publishing a magazine called hawk and whippoorwill dedicated to poems of man and nature
derleth died of a heart attack on july and is buried in st
aloysius cemetery in sauk city
the us bridge over the wisconsin river is named in his honor
derleth was roman catholic
in derleths biography dorothy m
grobe litersky stated that derleth was bisexual and maintained long term romantic relationships with both men and women
this assertion has not been verified however no names were given of these romantic partners and no evidence or acknowledgement of derleth having a bisexual or homosexual orientation has ever been found in his personal correspondence or writings
derleth wrote more than short stories and more than books during his lifetime
derleth wrote an expansive series of novels short stories journals poems and other works about sac prairie
derleth intended this series to comprise up to novels telling the projected life story of the region from the th century onwards with analogies to balzacs human comedy and prousts remembrance of things past
this and other early work by derleth made him a well known figure among the regional literary figures of his time early pulitzer prize winners hamlin garland and zona gale as well as sinclair lewis the last both an admirer and critic of derleth
as edward wagenknecht wrote in cavalcade of the american novel what mr derleth has that is lacking
in modern novelists generally is a country
he belongs
he writes of a land and a people that are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
in his fictional world there is a unity much deeper and more fundamental than anything that can be conferred by an ideology
it is clear too that he did not get the best and most fictionally useful part of his background material from research in the library like scott in his border novels he gives rather the impression of having drunk it in with his mothers milk
jim stephens editor of an august derleth reader argues what derleth accomplished
was to gather a wisconsin mythos which gave respect to the ancient fundament of our contemporary life
the author inaugurated the sac prairie saga with four novellas comprising place of hawks published by loring mussey in
at publication the detroit news wrote certainly with this book mr derleth may be added to the american writers of distinction
derleths first novel still is the summer night was published two years later by the famous charles scribners editor maxwell perkins and was the second in his sac prairie saga
village year the first in a series of journals meditations on nature midwestern village american life and more was published in to praise from the new york times book review a book of instant sensitive responsiveness
recreates its scene with acuteness and beauty and makes an unusual contribution to the americana of the present day
the new york herald tribune observed that derleth
deepens the value of his village setting by presenting in full the enduring natural background with the people projected against this the writing comes to have the quality of an old flemish picture humanity lively and amusing and loveable in the foreground and nature magnificent beyond
james grey writing in the st
louis dispatch concluded derleth has achieved a kind of prose equivalent of the spoon river anthology
in the same year evening in spring was published by charles scribners sons
this work derleth considered among his finest
what the milwaukee journal called this beautiful little love story is an autobiographical novel of first love beset by small town religious bigotry
the work received critical praise the new yorker considered it a story told with tenderness and charm while the chicago tribune concluded its as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told with rekindled emotion of the pangs of pain and the sharp clear sweetness of a boys first love
helen constance white wrote in the capital times that it was
the best articulated the most fully disciplined of his stories
these were followed in with shadow of night a scribners novel of which the chicago sun wrote structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel
a psychological novel of the first order and an adventure tale that is unique and inspiriting
in november however derleths work was attacked by his one time admirer and mentor sinclair lewis
writing in esquire lewis observed it is a proof of mr derleths merit that he makes one want to make the journey and see his particular avalon the wisconsin river shining among its islands and the castles of baron pierneau and hercules dousman
he is a champion and a justification of regionalism
yet he is also a burly bounding bustling self confident opinionated and highly sweatered young man with faults so grievous that a melancholy perusal of them may be of more value to apprentices than a study of his serious virtues
if he could ever be persuaded that he isnt half as good as he thinks he is if he would learn the art of sitting still and using a blue pencil he might become twice as good as he thinks he is which would about rank him with homer
derleth good humoredly reprinted the criticism along with a photograph of himself sans sweater on the back cover of his country journal village daybook
a lighter side to the sac prairie saga is a series of quasi autobiographical short stories known as the gus elker stories amusing tales of country life that peter ruber derleths last editor said were
models of construction and
fused with some of the most memorable characters in american literature
most were written between and the late s though the last tail of the dog was published in and won the scholastic magazine short story award for the year
the series was collected and republished in country matters in
walden west published in is considered by many derleths finest work
this prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of sac prairie journals but is organized around three themes the persistence of memory
the sounds and odors of the country
and thoreaus observation that the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation
a blend of nature writing philosophic musings and careful observation of the people and place of sac prairie
of this work george vukelich author of north country notebook writes derleths walden west is
the equal of sherwood andersons winesburgohio thornton wilders our town and edgar lee masters spoon river anthology
this was followed eight years later by return to walden west a work of similar quality but with a more noticeable environmentalist edge to the writing notes critic norbert blei
a close literary relative of the sac prairie saga was derleths wisconsin saga which comprises several historical novels
detective fiction represented another substantial body of derleths work
most notable among this work was a series of stories in affectionate pastiche of sherlock holmes whose creator sir arthur conan doyle he admired greatly
the stories feature a holmes styled british detective named solar pons of b praed street in london
these included one published novel as well
the series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as ellery queen anthony boucher vincent starrett and howard haycraft
in his volume the misadventures of sherlock holmes ellery queen wrote of derleths the norcross riddle an early pons story how many budding authors not even old enough to vote could have captured the spirit and atmosphere with as much fidelity queen adds his choice of the euphonic solar pons is an appealing addition to the fascinating lore of sherlockian nomenclature
vincent starrett in his foreword to the edition of the casebook of solar pons wrote that the series is as sparkling a galaxy of sherlockian pastiches as we have had since the canonical entertainments came to an end
despite close similarities to doyles creation pons lived in the post world war i era in the decades of the s and s
though derleth never wrote a pons novel to equal the hound of the baskervilles editor peter ruber wrote that derleth produced more than a few solar pons stories almost as good as sir arthurs and many that had better plot construction
although these stories were a form of diversion for derleth ruber who edited the original text solar pons omnibus edition argued because the stories were generally of such high quality they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery fiction rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless imitators of sherlock holmes
some of the stories were self published through a new imprint called mycroft moran an appellation of humorous significance to holmesian scholars
for approximately a decade an active supporting group was the praed street irregulars patterned after the baker street irregulars
in conan doyles two sons made some attempts to force derleth to cease publishing the solar pons series but the efforts were unsuccessful and were eventually withdrawn
derleths mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in sac prairie and featuring judge peck as the central character
derleth wrote many and varied childrens works including biographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer jacques marquette as well as ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau
arguably most important among his works for younger readers however is the steve and sim mystery series also known as the mill creek irregulars series
the ten volume series published between and is set in sac prairie of the s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the sac prairie saga as well as an extension of derleths body of mystery fiction
robert hood writing in the new york times said steve and sim the major characters are twentieth century cousins of huck finn and tom sawyer derleths minor characters little gems of comic drawing
the first novel in the series the moon tenders does in fact involve a rafting adventure down the wisconsin river which led regional writer jesse stuart to suggest the novel was one that older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth
the connection to the sac prairie saga was noted by the chicago tribune once again a small midwest community in s is depicted with perception skill and dry humor
derleth was a correspondent and friend of h
lovecraft when lovecraft wrote about le comte derlette in his fiction it was in homage to derleth
derleth invented the term cthulhu mythos to describe the fictional universe depicted in the series of stories shared by lovecraft and other writers in his circle
when lovecraft died in derleth and donald wandrei assembled a collection of lovecrafts stories and tried to get them published
existing publishers showed little interest so derleth and wandrei founded arkham house in for that purpose
the name of the company derived from lovecrafts fictional town of arkham massachusetts which features in many of his stories
in arkham house published the outsider and others a huge collection that contained most of lovecrafts known short stories
derleth and wandrei soon expanded arkham house and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book someone in the dark a collection of some of derleths own horror stories was published in
following lovecrafts death derleth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by lovecraft
these were published in weird tales and later in book form under the byline h
lovecraft and august derleth with derleth calling himself a posthumous collaborator
this practice has raised objections in some quarters that derleth simply used lovecrafts name to market what was essentially his own fiction s
joshi refers to the posthumous collaborations as marking the beginning of perhaps the most disreputable phase of derleths activities
dirk w
mosig s
joshi and richard l
tierney were dissatisfied with derleths invention of the term cthulhu mythos and his presentation of lovecrafts fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting derleths own christian world view which they contrast with lovecrafts depiction of an amoral universe
however robert m
price points out that while derleths tales are distinct from lovecrafts in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil nevertheless the basis of derlerths systemization are found in lovecraft
he also suggests that the differences can be overstated derleth was more optimistic than lovecraft in his conception of the mythos but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind
there are indeed tales wherein derleths protagonists get off scot free but often the hero is doomed as in lovecraft
and it must be remembered that an occasional lovecraftian hero does manage to overcome the odds eg in the horror in the museum the shunned house and the case of charles dexter ward
derleth also treated lovecrafts great old ones as representatives of elemental forces creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework
such debates aside derleths founding of arkham house and his successful effort to rescue lovecraft from literary oblivion are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field
for instance ramsey campbell has acknowledged derleths encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career and kirby mccauley has cited derleth and arkham house as an inspiration for his own anthology dark forces
arkham house and derleth published dark carnival the first book by ray bradbury as well
brian lumley cites the importance of derleth to his own lovecraftian work and contends in a introduction to derleths work that he was
one of the first finest and most discerning editors and publishers of macabre fiction
important as was derleths work to rescue hp lovecraft from literary obscurity at the time of lovecrafts death derleth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own still frequently anthologized
the best of this work recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories most of which were originally published in weird tales illustrates derleths original abilities in the genre
while derleth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts the compilers of these four anthologies including ramsey campbell note that the stories still resonate after more than years
in the library of america selected derleths story the panelled room for inclusion in its two century retrospective of american fantastic tales
derleth also wrote many historical novels as part of both the sac prairie saga and the wisconsin saga
he also wrote history arguably most notable among these was the wisconsin river of a thousand isles published in
the work was one in a series entitled the rivers of america conceived by writer constance lindsay skinner during the great depression as a series that would connect americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation
skinner wanted the series to be written by artists not academicians
derleth while not a trained historian was according to former wisconsin state historian william f
a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals
in the foreword to the reissue of the work by the university of wisconsin press thompson concluded no other writer of whatever background or training knew and understood his particular corner of the earth better than august derleth
additionally derleth wrote a number of volumes of poetry
three of his collections rind of earth selected poems and the edge of night were published by the decker press which also printed the work of other midwestern poets such as edgar lee masters
derleth was also the author of several biographies of other writers including zona gale ralph waldo emerson and henry david thoreau
he also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early th century comics such as buster brown little nemo in slumberland and katzenjammer kids as well as a book of childrens poetry entitled a boys way and the foreword to tales from an indian lodge by phebe jewell nichols
derleth also wrote under the pen names stephen grendon kenyon holmes and tally mason
derleths papers were donated to the wisconsin historical society in madison
the alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range that is entirely in europe stretching approximately across seven alpine countries france switzerland italy liechtenstein austria germany and slovenia
the alpine arch extends from nice on the western mediterranean to trieste on the adriatic and vienna at the beginning of the pannonian basin
the mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the african and eurasian tectonic plates collided
extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as mont blanc and the matterhorn
mont blanc spans the french italian border and at is the highest mountain in the alps
the alpine region area contains peaks higher than list of alpine four thousanders
the altitude and size of the range affect the climate in europe in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones
wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of and plants such as edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations
evidence of human habitation in the alps goes back to the palaeolithic era
a mummified man determined to be years old was discovered on a glacier at the austrian italian border in
by the th century bc the celtic la tne culture was well established
hannibal notably crossed the alps with a herd of elephants and the romans had settlements in the region
in napoleon crossed one of the mountain passes with an army of
the th and th centuries saw an influx of naturalists writers and artists in particular the romantics followed by the golden age of alpinism as mountaineers began to ascend the peaks
the alpine region has a strong cultural identity
the traditional culture of farming cheesemaking and woodworking still exists in alpine villages although the tourist industry began to grow early in the th century and expanded greatly after world war ii to become the dominant industry by the end of the century
the winter olympic games have been hosted in the swiss french italian austrian and german alps
the region is home to million people and has million annual visitors
the english word alps comes from the latin alpes
the latin word could possibly come from the adjective or could possibly come from the greek goddess alphito whose name is related to alphita the white flour alphos a dull white leprosy and finally the proto indo european word
similarly the river god alpheus is also supposed to derive from the greek alphos and means whitish
in his commentary on the aeneid of vergil the late fourth century grammarian maurus servius honoratus says that all high mountains are called alpes by celts
according to the oxford english dictionary the latin alpes might derive from a pre indo european word alb hill albania is a related derivation
albania a name not native to the region known as the country of albania has been used as a name for several mountainous areas across europe
in roman times albania was a name for the eastern caucasus while in the english languages albania was occasionally used as a name for scotland although it is more likely derived from the latin word the colour white
in modern languages the term alp alm albe or alpe refers to a grazing pastures in the alpine regions below the glaciers not the peaks
an alp refers to a high mountain pasture typically near or above the tree line where cows and other livestock are taken to be grazed during the summer months and where huts and hay barns can be found sometimes constituting tiny hamlets
therefore the term the alps as a reference to the mountains is a misnomer
the term for the mountain peaks varies by nation and language words such as horn kogel kopf gipfel spitze stock and berg are used in german speaking regions mont pic tte pointe dent roche and aiguille in french speaking regions and monte picco corno punta pizzo or cima in italian speaking regions
the alps are a crescent shaped geographic feature of central europe that ranges in an arc from east to west and is in width
the mean height of the mountain peaks is
the range stretches from the mediterranean sea north above the po basin extending through france from grenoble and stretching eastward through mid and southern switzerland
the range continues onward toward vienna austria and east to the adriatic sea and slovenia
to the south it dips into northern italy and to the north extends to the southern border of bavaria in germany
in areas like chiasso switzerland and allgu bavaria the demarcation between the mountain range and the flatlands are clear in other places such as geneva the demarcation is less clear
the countries with the greatest alpine territory are austria italy france and switzerland
the highest portion of the range is divided by the glacial trough of the rhne valley from mont blanc to the matterhorn and monte rosa on the southern side and the bernese alps on the northern
the peaks in the easterly portion of the range in austria and slovenia are smaller than those in the central and western portions
the variances in nomenclature in the region spanned by the alps make classification of the mountains and subregions difficult but a general classification is that of the eastern alps and western alps with the divide between the two occurring in eastern switzerland according to geologist stefan schmid near the splgen pass
the highest peaks of the western alps and eastern alps respectively are mont blanc at and piz bernina at
the second highest major peaks are monte rosa at and ortler at respectively
a series of lower mountain ranges run parallel to the main chain of the alps including the french prealps in france and the jura mountains in switzerland and france
the secondary chain of the alps follows the watershed from the mediterranean sea to the wienerwald passing over many of the highest and most well known peaks in the alps
from the colle di cadibona to col de tende it runs westwards before turning to the northwest and then near the colle della maddalena to the north
upon reaching the swiss border the line of the main chain heads approximately east northeast a heading it follows until its end near vienna
the northeast end of the alpine arc directly on the danube which flows into the black sea is the leopoldsberg near vienna
in contrast the southeastern part of the alps ends on the adriatic sea in the area around trieste towards duino and barcola
the alps have been crossed for war and commerce and by pilgrims students and tourists
crossing routes by road train or foot are known as passes and usually consist of depressions in the mountains in which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre mountainous zones
in the medieval period hospices were established by religious orders at the summits of many of the main passes
the most important passes are the col de liseran the col agnel the brenner pass the mont cenis the great st
bernard pass the col de tende the gotthard pass the semmering pass the simplon pass and the stelvio pass
crossing the italian austrian border the brenner pass separates the tztal alps and zillertal alps and has been in use as a trading route since the th century
the lowest of the alpine passes at the semmering crosses from lower austria to styria since the th century when a hospice was built there it has seen continuous use
a railroad with a tunnel long was built along the route of the pass in the mid th century
with a summit of the great st bernard pass is one of the highest in the alps crossing the italian swiss border east of the pennine alps along the flanks of mont blanc
the pass was used by napoleon bonaparte to cross troops in
the mont cenis pass has been a major commercial and military road between western europe and italy
the pass was crossed by many troops on their way to the italian peninsula
from constantine i pepin the short and charlemagne to henry iv napolon and more recently the german gebirgsjgers during world war ii
now the pass has been supplanted by the frjus highway tunnel and rail tunnel
the saint gotthard pass crosses from central switzerland to ticino in the saint gotthard railway tunnel was opened connecting lucerne in switzerland with milan in italy
years later followed gotthard road tunnel connecting the a motorway in gschenen on the north side with airolo on the south side exactly like the railway tunnel
on june the worlds longest railway tunnel the gotthard base tunnel was opened which connects erstfeld in canton of uri with bodio in canton of ticino by two single tubes of
it is the first tunnel that traverses the alps on a flat route
from december it has been part of the regular railway timetable and used hourly as standard ride between basel lucerne zurich and bellinzona lugano milan
the highest pass in the alps is the col de liseran in savoy at followed by the stelvio pass in northern italy at the road was built in the s
the union internationale des associations dalpinisme has defined a list of official alpine summits that reach at least
the list includes not only mountains but also subpeaks with little prominence that are considered important mountaineering objectives
below are listed the four thousanders with at least of prominence
while mont blanc was first climbed in and the jungfrau in most of the alpine four thousanders were climbed during the second half of the th century notably piz bernina the dom the grand combin the weisshorn and the barre des crins the ascent of the matterhorn in marked the end of the golden age of alpinism
karl blodig was among the first to successfully climb all the major m peaks
he completed his series of ascents in
many of the big alpine three thousanders were climbed in the early th century notably the grossglockner and the ortler although some of them were climbed only much later such at mont pelvoux monte viso and la meije
the first british mont blanc ascent by a man was in the first ascent by a woman was in
by the mid s swiss mountaineers had ascended most of the peaks and were eagerly sought as mountain guides
edward whymper reached the top of the matterhorn in and in the last of the six great north faces of the alps was climbed with the first ascent of the eiger nordwand
important geological concepts were established as naturalists began studying the rock formations of the alps in the th century
in the mid th century the now defunct idea of geosynclines was used to explain the presence of folded mountain chains
this theory was replaced in the mid th century by the theory of plate tectonics
the formation of the alps was an episodic process that began about million years ago
in the paleozoic era the pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate it broke into separate plates during the mesozoic era and the tethys sea developed between laurasia and gondwana during the jurassic period
the tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the alpide belt from gibraltar through the himalayas to indonesia a process that began at the end of the mesozoic and continues into the present
the formation of the alps was a segment of this orogenic process caused by the collision between the african and the eurasian plates that began in the late cretaceous period
under extreme compressive stresses and pressure marine sedimentary rocks were uplifted forming characteristic recumbent folds and thrust faults
as the rising peaks underwent erosion a layer of marine flysch sediments was deposited in the foreland basin and the sediments became involved in younger folds as the orogeny progressed
coarse sediments from the continual uplift and erosion were later deposited in foreland areas north of the alps
these regions in switzerland and bavaria are well developed containing classic examples of flysch which is sedimentary rock formed during mountain building
the alpine orogeny occurred in ongoing cycles through to the paleogene causing differences in folded structures with a late stage orogeny causing the development of the jura mountains
a series of tectonic events in the triassic jurassic and cretaceous periods caused different paleogeographic regions
the alps are subdivided by different lithology and nappe structures according to the orogenic events that affected them
the geological subdivision differentiates the western eastern alps and southern alps the helveticum in the north the penninicum and austroalpine system in the centre and south of the periadriatic seam the southern alpine system
according to geologist stefan schmid because the western alps underwent a metamorphic event in the cenozoic era while the austroalpine peaks underwent an event in the cretaceous period the two areas show distinct differences in nappe formations
flysch deposits in the southern alps of lombardy probably occurred in the cretaceous or later
peaks in france italy and switzerland lie in the houillire zone which consists of basement with sediments from the mesozoic era
high massifs with external sedimentary cover are more common in the western alps and were affected by neogene period thin skinned thrusting whereas the eastern alps have comparatively few high peaked massifs
similarly the peaks in eastern switzerland extending to western austria consist of thin skinned sedimentary folding that detached from former basement rock
in simple terms the structure of the alps consists of layers of rock of european african and oceanic origin
the bottom nappe structure is of continental european origin above which are stacked marine sediment nappes topped off by nappes derived from the african plate
the matterhorn is an example of the ongoing orogeny and shows evidence of great folding
the tip of the mountain consists of gneisses from the african plate the base of the peak below the glaciated area consists of european basement rock
the sequence of tethyan marine sediments and their oceanic basement is sandwiched between rock derived from the african and european plates
the core regions of the alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion produced the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the swiss alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas
peaks such as mont blanc the matterhorn and high peaks in the pennine alps the brianonnais and hohe tauern consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock
due to the ever present geologic instability earthquakes continue in the alps to this day
typically the largest earthquakes in the alps have been between magnitude and on the richter scale
geodetic measurements show ongoing topographic uplift at rates of up to about mm per year in the north western and central alps and at mm per year in the eastern and south western alps
the underlying mechanisms that jointly drive the present day uplift pattern are the isostatic rebound due to the melting of the last glacial maximum ice cap or long term erosion detachment of the western alpine subducting slab mantle convection as well as ongoing horizontal convergence between africa and europe but their relative contributions to the uplift of the alps are difficult to quantify and likely to vary significantly in space and time
the alps are a source of minerals that have been mined for thousands of years
in the th to th centuries bc during the hallstatt culture celtic tribes mined copper later the romans mined gold for coins in the bad gastein area
erzberg in styria furnishes high quality iron ore for the steel industry
crystals such as cinnabar amethyst and quartz are found throughout much of the alpine region
the cinnabar deposits in slovenia are a notable source of cinnabar pigments
alpine crystals have been studied and collected for hundreds of years and began to be classified in the th century
leonhard euler studied the shapes of crystals and by the th century crystal hunting was common in alpine regions
david friedrich wiser amassed a collection of crystals that he studied and documented
in the th century robert parker wrote a well known work about the rock crystals of the swiss alps at the same period a commission was established to control and standardize the naming of alpine minerals
in the miocene epoch the mountains underwent severe erosion because of glaciation which was noted in the mid th century by naturalist louis agassiz who presented a paper proclaiming the alps were covered in ice at various intervals a theory he formed when studying rocks near his neuchtel home which he believed originated to the west in the bernese oberland
because of his work he came to be known as the father of the ice age concept although other naturalists before him put forth similar ideas
agassiz studied glacier movement in the s at the unteraar glacier where he found the glacier moved per year more rapidly in the middle than at the edges
his work was continued by other scientists and now a permanent laboratory exists inside a glacier under the jungfraujoch devoted exclusively to the study of alpine glaciers
glaciers pick up rocks and sediment with them as they flow
this causes erosion and the formation of valleys over time
the inn valley is an example of a valley carved by glaciers during the ice ages with a typical terraced structure caused by erosion
eroded rocks from the most recent ice age lie at the bottom of the valley while the top of the valley consists of erosion from earlier ice ages
glacial valleys have characteristically steep walls valleys with lower reliefs and talus slopes are remnants of glacial troughs or previously infilled valleys
moraines piles of rock picked up during the movement of the glacier accumulate at edges centre and the terminus of glaciers
alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice long sweeping rivers spread in a fan like shape and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks
the stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period
the cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous crevasses often invisible under new snowfall which causes the greatest danger to mountaineers
glaciers end in ice caves by trailing into a lake or river or by shedding snowmelt on a meadow
sometimes a piece of glacier will detach or break resulting in flooding property damage and loss of life
high levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to permafrost levels in some areas whereas in other more arid regions glaciers remain above about the level
the of the alps covered by glaciers in had shrunk to by resulting in decreased river run off levels
forty percent of the glaciation in austria has disappeared since and of that in switzerland
although the alpine topography shows marked glacial morphologies the mechanisms by which glacial reshaping occurs are unclear
numerical modeling suggests that glacial erosion propagates from low elevations to high elevations leading to an early increase of local relief followed by lowering of the mean orogen elevation
the alps provide lowland europe with drinking water irrigation and hydroelectric power
although the area is only about of the surface area of europe the alps provide up to of water to lowland europe particularly to arid areas and during the summer months
cities such as milan depend on of water from alpine runoff
water from the rivers is used in at least hydroelectricity power plants considering only those producing at least mw of electricity
major european rivers flow from the alps such as the rhine the rhne the inn and the po all of which have headwaters in the alps and flow into neighbouring countries finally emptying into the north sea the mediterranean sea the adriatic sea and the black sea
other rivers such as the danube have major tributaries flowing into them that originate in the alps
the rhne is second to the nile as a freshwater source to the mediterranean sea the river begins as glacial meltwater flows into lake geneva and from there to france where one of its uses is to cool nuclear power plants
the rhine originates in a area in switzerland and represents almost of water exported from the country
tributary valleys some of which are complicated channel water to the main valleys which can experience flooding during the snowmelt season when rapid runoff causes debris torrents and swollen rivers
the rivers form lakes such as lake geneva a crescent shaped lake crossing the swiss border with lausanne on the swiss side and the town of evian les bains on the french side
in germany the medieval st
bartholomews chapel was built on the south side of the knigssee accessible only by boat or by climbing over the abutting peaks
additionally the alps have led to the creation of large lakes in italy
for instance the sarca the primary inflow of lake garda originates in the italian alps
the italian lakes are a popular tourist destination since the roman era for their mild climate
scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use
for example each year more water is diverted from rivers for snowmaking in the ski resorts the effect of which is yet unknown
furthermore the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower than expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands
the alps are a classic example of what happens when a temperate area at lower altitude gives way to higher elevation terrain
elevations around the world that have cold climates similar to those of the polar regions have been called alpine
a rise from sea level into the upper regions of the atmosphere causes the temperature to decrease
the effect of mountain chains on prevailing winds is to carry warm air belonging to the lower region into an upper zone where it expands in volume at the cost of a proportionate loss of temperature often accompanied by precipitation in the form of snow or rain
the height of the alps is sufficient to divide the weather patterns in europe into a wet north and dry south because moisture is sucked from the air as it flows over the high peaks
the severe weather in the alps has been studied since the th century particularly the weather patterns such as the seasonal foehn wind
numerous weather stations were placed in the mountains early in the early th century providing continuous data for climatologists
some of the valleys are quite arid such as the aosta valley in italy the maurienne in france the valais in switzerland and northern tyrol
the areas that are not arid and receive high precipitation experience periodic flooding from rapid snowmelt and runoff
the mean precipitation in the alps ranges from a low of per year to per year with the higher levels occurring at high altitudes
at altitudes between snowfall begins in november and accumulates through to april or may when the melt begins
snow lines vary from above which the snow is permanent and the temperatures hover around the freezing point even during july and august
high water levels in streams and rivers peak in june and july when the snow is still melting at the higher altitudes
the alps are split into five climatic zones each with different vegetation
the climate plant life and animal life vary among the different sections or zones of the mountains
the lowest zone is the colline zone which exists between depending on the location
the montane zone extends from followed by the sub alpine zone from
the alpine zone extending from tree line to the snow line is followed by the glacial zone which covers the glaciated areas of the mountain
climatic conditions show variances within the same zones for example weather conditions at the head of a mountain valley extending directly from the peaks are colder and more severe than those at the mouth of a valley which tend to be less severe and receive less snowfall
various models of climate change have been projected into the nd century for the alps with an expectation that a trend toward increased temperatures will have an effect on snowfall snowpack glaciation and river runoff
significant changes of both natural and anthropogenic origins have already been diagnosed from observations including a reduction per decade in snow cover duration over the last years which also highlights climate change adaptation needs due to impacts on the climate and regional socio economic activities
thirteen thousand species of plants have been identified in the alpine regions
alpine plants are grouped by habitat and soil type which can be limestone or non calcareous
the habitats range from meadows bogs and woodland areas to soil less scree and moraines and rock faces and ridges
a natural vegetation limit with altitude is given by the presence of the chief deciduous trees oak beech ash and sycamore maple
these do not reach the same elevation nor are they often found growing together but their upper limit corresponds accurately enough to the change from a temperate to a colder climate that is further proved by a change in the presence of wild herbaceous vegetation
this limit usually lies about above the sea on the north side of the alps but on the southern slopes it often rises to sometimes even to
above the forestry there is often a band of short pine trees which is in turn superseded by alpenrosen dwarf shrubs typically rhododendron ferrugineum or rhododendron hirsutum
although alpenrose prefers acidic soil the plants are found throughout the region
above the tree line is the area defined as alpine where in the alpine meadow plants are found that have adapted well to harsh conditions of cold temperatures aridity and high altitudes
the alpine area fluctuates greatly because of regional fluctuations in tree lines
alpine plants such as the alpine gentian grow in abundance in areas such as the meadows above the lauterbrunnental
gentians are named after the illyrian king gentius and species of the early spring blooming flower grow in the alps in a range of
writing about the gentians in switzerland d
lawrence described them as darkening the day time torch like with the smoking blueness of plutos gloom
gentians tend to appear repeatedly as the spring blooming takes place at progressively later dates moving from the lower altitude to the higher altitude meadows where the snow melts much later than in the valleys
on the highest rocky ledges the spring flowers bloom in the summer
at these higher altitudes the plants tend to form isolated cushions
in the alps several species of flowering plants have been recorded above including ranunculus glacialis androsace alpina and saxifraga biflora
eritrichium nanum commonly known as the king of the alps is the most elusive of the alpine flowers growing on rocky ridges at
perhaps the best known of the alpine plants is edelweiss which grows in rocky areas and can be found at altitudes as low as and as high as
the plants that grow at the highest altitudes have adapted to conditions by specialization such as growing in rock screes that give protection from winds
the extreme and stressful climatic conditions give way to the growth of plant species with secondary metabolites important for medicinal purposes
origanum vulgare prunella vulgaris solanum nigrum and urtica dioica are some of the more useful medicinal species found in the alps
human interference has nearly exterminated the trees in many areas and except for the beech forests of the austrian alps forests of deciduous trees are rarely found after the extreme deforestation between the th and th centuries
the vegetation has changed since the second half of the th century as the high alpine meadows cease to be harvested for hay or used for grazing which eventually might result in a regrowth of the forest
in some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non skiing months whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers
the alps are a habitat for species of wildlife ranging from the tiniest snow fleas to brown bears many of which have made adaptations to the harsh cold conditions and high altitudes to the point that some only survive in specific micro climates either directly above or below the snow line
the largest mammal to live in the highest altitudes are the alpine ibex which have been sighted as high as
the ibex live in caves and descend to eat the succulent alpine grasses
classified as antelopes chamois are smaller than ibex and found throughout the alps living above the tree line and are common in the entire alpine range
areas of the eastern alps are still home to brown bears
in switzerland the canton of bern was named for the bears but the last bear is recorded as having been killed in above kleine scheidegg by three hunters from grindelwald
many rodents such as voles live underground
marmots live almost exclusively above the tree line as high as
they hibernate in large groups to provide warmth and can be found in all areas of the alps in large colonies they build beneath the alpine pastures
golden eagles and bearded vultures are the largest birds to be found in the alps they nest high on rocky ledges and can be found at altitudes of
the most common bird is the alpine chough which can be found scavenging at climbers huts or the jungfraujoch a high altitude tourist destination
reptiles such as adders and vipers live up to the snow line because they cannot bear the cold temperatures they hibernate underground and soak up the warmth on rocky ledges
the high altitude alpine salamanders have adapted to living above the snow line by giving birth to fully developed young rather than laying eggs
brown trout can be found in the streams up to the snow line
molluscs such as the wood snail live up the snow line
popularly gathered as food the snails are now protected
several species of moths live in the alps some of which are believed to have evolved in the same habitat up to million years ago long before the alps were created
blue butterflies can commonly be seen drinking from the snowmelt some species of blues fly as high as
the butterflies tend to be large such as those from the swallowtail parnassius family with a habitat that ranges to
twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is rosalia alpina
spiders such as the large wolf spider live above the snow line and can be seen as high as
scorpions can be found in the italian alps
some of the species of moths and insects show evidence of having been indigenous to the area from as long ago as the alpine orogeny
in mosson in valais switzerland dinosaur tracks were found in the s dating probably from the triassic period
when the ice melted after the wrm glaciation paleolithic settlements were established along the lake shores and in cave systems
evidence of human habitation has been found in caves near the vercors cave system close to grenoble and echirolles
in austria the mondsee lake shows evidence of houses built on piles
standing stones have been found in the alpine areas of france and italy
about drawings and etchings have been documented and are known as the rock drawings in valcamonica
a mummy of a neolithic human known as tzi was discovered on the similaun
his clothing lets modern people assume that he was an alpine farmer
while the location and manner of his death suggests that tzi was traveling
analysis of the mitochondrial dna of tzi has shown that he belongs to the k subclade
from the th to the th century bc much of the alps was settled by the germanic peoples lombards alemanni bavarii and franks
celt tribes settled in modern day switzerland between and bc
the raeti lived in the eastern regions while the west was occupied by the helvetii and the allobroges settled in the rhne valley and in savoy
the ligures and adriatic veneti lived in northwest italy and triveneto respectively
the celts mined salt in areas such as salzburg where evidence was found of the hallstatt culture
by the th century bc the la tne culture was well established in the region and became known for high quality celtic art
between and bc prolonged warfare in the alps resulted in the devastation of agricultural land and human settlements ultimately triggering the enslavement of men women and children goods had to be imported as a result
the etruscan civilization responded to raids by the massalia and acquired absolute control over the alpine trade routes
aggressors in modern day italy were dealt with and an alliance was formed with the celts
the grip of the etruscan settlements broke down as the roman political system expanded so as to take control over alpine trade routes that connected human settlements in the alps with settlements in the mediterranean
during the second punic war in bc the carthage general hannibal initiated one of the most celebrated achievements of any military force in ancient warfare recorded as hannibal crossing the alps
the roman people built roads along the alpine mountain passes which continued to be used through the medieval period
roman road markers can still be found on the alpine mountain passes
during the gallic wars in bc julius caesar defeated the helvetii
the rhaetian continued to resist but their territory was eventually conquered when the romans crossed the danube valley and defeated the brigantes
the romans built settlements in the alps
in towns such as aosta martigny lausanne and partenkirchen remains of villas arenas and temples have been discovered
christianity was established in the alps by the roman people
monasteries and churches were constructed even at high alpine altitudes
the franks expanded their carolingian empire while the baiuvarii introduced feudalism in the eastern alps
the construction of castles in the alps supported the growing number of dukedoms and kingdoms
castello del buonconsiglio in trento still has intricate frescoes and excellent examples of gothic art
the chteau de chillon is preserved as an example of medieval architecture
there are several important alpine saints and one such one is saint maurice
much of the medieval period was a time of power struggles between competing dynasties such as the house of savoy the visconti of milan and the house of habsburg
the great st bernard hospice built in the th or th centuries at the summit of the great saint bernard pass was a shelter for humans and destination for pilgrims
in to protect themselves from incursions by the house of habsburg four alpine cantons drew up the federal charter of which is considered to be a declaration of independence from neighboring kingdoms
after a series of battles fought in the th th and th centuries more cantons joined the confederacy and by the th century switzerland was established as a sovereign state
in the alps the war of the spanish succession fallout resulted in a treaty part of the peace of utrecht which relocated the western alps border along the watersheds
historically the alps were used to determine the borders of political and administrative gangs but the peace of utrecht was the first significant body of treaty that considered geographical conditions
the alps were carved up and borders were agreed so that enclaves in the alps could be eliminated
during the napoleonic wars in the late th century and early th century napoleon annexed territory formerly controlled by the house of habsburg and the house of savoy
in the helvetic republic was established two years later an army across the great st bernard pass
in the russian imperial military engaged the revolutionary french army in the alps this episode has been recorded as significant achievement in mountain warfare
in october the troops commanded by alexander suvorov were surrounded in the alps by much larger french troops
the russian troops broke out mauled the french troops and retreated through the panix pass
after the fall of napoleon many alpine countries developed heavy protections to prevent further invasion
thus savoy built a series of fortifications to protect the major alpine passes such as the col du mont cenis which was crossed by charlemagne to obliterate the lombards
the maurienne province and its capital saint jean de maurienne is a massive fortification built on cliffs and steep mountains
in the th century the monasteries built in the alps to shelter humans became tourist destinations
the benedictines had built monasteries in lucerne and oberammergau
the cistercians built their temple at lake constance
meanwhile the augustinians maintained abbeys in savoy and one in interlaken
radiocarbon dated charcoal placed around years ago was found in the drachloch cave above the village of vattis in the canton of st
gallen proving that the high peaks were visited by prehistoric people
seven bear skulls from the cave may have been buried by the same prehistoric people
the peaks however were mostly ignored except for a few notable examples and long left to the exclusive attention of the people of the adjoining valleys
the mountain peaks were seen as terrifying the abode of dragons and demons to the point that people blindfolded themselves to cross the alpine passes
the glaciers remained a mystery and many still believed the highest areas to be inhabited by dragons
charles vii of france ordered his chamberlain to climb mont aiguille in
the knight reached the summit of rocciamelone where he left a bronze triptych of three crosses a feat which he conducted with the use of ladders to traverse the ice
in antoine de ville climbed mont aiguille without reaching the summit an experience he described as horrifying and terrifying
leonardo da vinci was fascinated by variations of light in the higher altitudes and climbed a mountain scholars are uncertain which one some believe it may have been monte rosa
from his description of a blue like that of a gentian sky it is thought that he reached a significantly high altitude
in the th century four chamonix men almost made the summit of mont blanc but were overcome by altitude sickness and snowblindness
conrad gessner was the first naturalist to ascend the mountains in the th century to study them writing that in the mountains he found the theatre of the lord
by the th century more naturalists began to arrive to explore study and conquer the high peaks
two men who first explored the regions of ice and snow were horace bndict de saussure in the pennine alps and the benedictine monk of disentis placidus a spescha
born in geneva saussure was enamoured with the mountains from an early age he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the bernese oberland the savoy the piedmont and valais studying the glaciers and geology as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval
saussure in was a member of the third ascent of mont blanc today the summits of all the peaks have been climbed
albrecht von hallers poem die alpen published in described the mountains as an area of mythical purity
jean jacques rousseau presented the alps as a place of allure and beauty in his novel julie or the new heloise published in
later the first wave of romanticism such as johann wolfgang von goethe and j
turner came to admire the alpine scenery wordsworth visited the area in writing of his experiences in the prelude
schiller later wrote the play william tell which tells the story of the legendary swiss marksman william tell as part of the greater swiss struggle for independence from the habsburg empire in the early th century
at the end of the napoleonic wars the alpine countries began to see an influx of poets artists and musicians as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature
in byron percy bysshe shelley and his wife mary shelley visited geneva and all three were inspired by the scenery in their writings
during these visits shelley wrote the poem mont blanc byron wrote the prisoner of chillon and the dramatic poem manfred and mary shelley who found the scenery overwhelming conceived the idea for the novel frankenstein in her villa on the shores of lake geneva amid a thunderstorm
when coleridge travelled to chamonix he declaimed in defiance of shelley who had signed himself atheos in the guestbook of the hotel de londres near montenvers who would be who could be an atheist in this valley of wonders
by the mid th century scientists began to arrive en masse to study the geology and ecology of the region
from the beginning of the th century the tourism and mountaineering development of the alps began
in the early years of the golden age of alpinism initially scientific activities were mixed with sport for example by the physicist john tyndall with the first ascent of the matterhorn by edward whymper being the highlight
in the later years the silver age of alpinism the focus was on mountain sports and climbing
the first president of the alpine club john ball is considered the discoverer of the dolomites which for decades were the focus of climbers like paul grohmann michael innerkofler and angelo dibona
fall adolf hitler commissioned the first of a series of refurbishments which eventually turned a mountain cottage later named berghof into a fortified citadel
this domestic but representative fortification had two small bedrooms and a full bathroom planned by the munich architect and nsdap member josef neumaier
guests such as rudolf hess stayed over sleeping in tents or over the garage
the alps adolf hitler and improbable powerful organizations have been subject to crime fiction
the alps acted as a geographical barrier to italy and the alps for centuries were permeated with established smuggling routes known as green line
after world war ii members of the schutzstaffel that feared prosecution as war criminals known in modern english only as ss disappeared into a crowd of refugees
massive numbers of refugees entered italy illegally by navigating the alps
smugglers of humans claim that crossing the alps is less dangerous or deadly than traveling km on water between tripoli and lampedusa with a tramp ship or a dinghy
undocumented migrants visa overstayers false tourists asylum seekers and other clandestine humans lose their lives crossing the alps
the exact number of smuggled humans who die a brutal death in the alps can only be estimated
the largest city within the alps is the city of grenoble in france
other larger and important cities within the alps with over inhabitants are in tyrol with bolzano bozen trento and innsbruck
larger cities outside the alps are milan verona turin munich graz vienna salzburg ljubljana maribor kranj zurich geneva nice and lyon
the population of the region is million spread across eight countries
on the rim of the mountains on the plateaus and on the plains the economy consists of manufacturing and service jobs whereas in the higher altitudes and the mountains farming is still essential to the economy
farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of alpine culture industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology
the alpine regions are multicultural and linguistically diverse
dialects are common and vary from valley to valley and region to region
in the slavic alps alone dialects have been identified
some of the romance dialects spoken in the french swiss and italian alps of aosta valley derive from arpitan while the southern part of the western range is related to occitan the german dialects derive from germanic tribal languages
romansh spoken by two percent of the population in southeast switzerland is an ancient rhaeto romanic language derived from latin remnants of ancient celtic languages and perhaps etruscan
much of the alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and the highest villages became mainstays leading to strong traditions of carpentry woodcarving baking pastry making and cheesemaking
farming has been a traditional occupation for centuries although it became less dominant in the th century with the advent of tourism
grazing and pasture land are limited because of the steep and rocky topography of the alps
in mid june cows are moved to the highest pastures close to the snowline where they are watched by herdsmen who stay in the high altitudes often living in stone huts or wooden barns during the summers
villagers celebrate the day the cows are herded up to the pastures and again when they return in mid september
the almabtrieb alpabzug alpabfahrt dsalpes is celebrated by decorating the cows with garlands and enormous cowbells while the farmers dress in traditional costumes
cheesemaking is an ancient tradition in most alpine countries
a wheel of cheese from the emmental in switzerland can weigh up to and the beaufort in savoy can weigh up to
owners of the cows traditionally receive from the cheesemakers a portion about the proportion of the cows milk from the summer months in the high alps
haymaking is an important farming activity in mountain villages that have become somewhat mechanized in recent years although the slopes are so steep that scythes are usually necessary to cut the grass
hay is normally brought in twice a year often also on festival days
in the high villages people live in homes built according to medieval designs that withstand cold winters
the kitchen is separated from the living area and second floor bedrooms benefit from rising heat
the typical swiss chalet originated in the bernese oberland
chalets often face south or downhill and are built of solid wood with a steeply gabled roof to allow accumulated snow to slide off easily
stairs leading to upper levels are sometimes built on the outside and balconies are sometimes enclosed
food is passed from the kitchen to the stube where the dining room table is placed
some meals are communal such as fondue where a pot is set in the middle of the table for each person to dip into
other meals are still served traditionally on carved wooden plates
furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation
roofs are traditionally constructed from alpine rocks such as pieces of schist gneiss or slate
such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys as in the maurienne valley in savoy where the amount of snow during the cold months is important
the inclination of the roof cannot exceed allowing the snow to stay on top thereby functioning as insulation from the cold
in the lower areas where the forests are widespread wooden tiles are traditionally used
commonly made of norway spruce they are called tavaillon
in the german speaking parts of the alps there is a strong tradition of alpine folk culture
old traditions are carefully maintained among inhabitants of alpine areas even though this is seldom obvious to the visitor many people are members of cultural associations where the alpine folk culture is cultivated
at cultural events traditional folk costume is expected typically lederhosen for men and dirndls for women
visitors can get a glimpse of the rich customs of the alps at public volksfeste
even when large events feature only a little folk culture all participants take part with gusto
good opportunities to see local people celebrating the traditional culture occur at the many fairs wine festivals and firefighting festivals which fill weekends in the countryside from spring to autumn
alpine festivals vary from country to country
frequently they include music dance sports as well as traditions with pagan roots such as the lighting of fires on walpurgis night and saint johns eve
many areas celebrate fastnacht in the weeks before lent
folk costume also continues to be worn for most weddings and festivals
the alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such as oberstdorf in bavaria saalbach in austria davos in switzerland chamonix in france and cortina dampezzo in italy recording more than a million annual visitors
with over million visitors a year tourism is integral to the alpine economy with much of it coming from winter sports although summer visitors are also an important component
the tourism industry began in the early th century when foreigners visited the alps travelled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery and stayed at the spa resorts
large hotels were built during the belle poque cog railways built early in the th century brought tourists to ever higher elevations with the jungfraubahn terminating at the jungfraujoch well above the eternal snow line after going through a tunnel in eiger
during this period winter sports were slowly introduced in the first figure skating championship was held in st
moritz and downhill skiing became a popular sport with english visitors early in the th century as the first ski lift was installed in above grindelwald
in the first half of the th century the olympic winter games were held three times in alpine venues the winter olympics in chamonix france the winter olympics in st
moritz switzerland and the winter olympics in garmisch partenkirchen germany
during world war ii the winter games were cancelled but after that time the winter games have been held in st
moritz cortina dampezzo innsbruck austria grenoble france albertville france and torino
in the lauberhorn rennen was run for the first time on the lauberhorn above wengen the equally demanding hahnenkamm was first run in the same year in kitzbhl austria
both races continue to be held each january on successive weekends
the lauberhorn is the more strenuous downhill race at and poses danger to racers who reach within seconds of leaving the start gate
during the post world war i period ski lifts were built in swiss and austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors but summer tourism continued to be important by the mid th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the s several new villages were built in france devoted almost exclusively to skiing such as les menuires
until this point austria and switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports but by the end of the th century and into the early st century france italy and the tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors
from to the present ski lifts have been modernized and snow making machines installed at many resorts leading to mounting concerns regarding the loss of traditional alpine culture and uncertainties regarding sustainable development
for instance the number of ski resorts and piste kilometres has declined since a likely result of climatic change
the region is serviced by of roads used by six million vehicles per year
train travel is well established in the alps with for instance of track for every in a country such as switzerland
most of europes highest railways are located there
in the new ltschberg base tunnel was opened which circumvents the years older ltschberg tunnel
with the opening of the gotthard base tunnel on june it bypasses the gotthard tunnel built in the th century and realizes the first flat route through the alps
some high mountain villages are car free either because of inaccessibility or by choice
wengen and zermatt are accessible only by cable car or cog rail trains
avoriaz is car free with other alpine villages considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile alpine terrain
the lower regions and larger towns of the alps are well served by motorways and main roads but higher mountain passes and byroads which are amongst the highest in europe can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes
many passes are closed in winter
several airports around the alps as well as long distance rail links from all neighbouring countries afford large numbers of travellers easy access

philosophically camuss views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism
some consider camuss work to show him to be an existentialist even though he himself firmly rejected the term throughout his lifetime
albert camus was born on november in a working class neighbourhood in mondovi in french algeria
his mother catherine hlne camus was french with balearic spanish ancestry
he never knew his father lucien camus a poor french agricultural worker killed in action while serving with zouaves in october during world war i
camus his mother and other relatives lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the belcourt section of algiers
camus was a second generation french inhabitant of algeria a french territory from until
his paternal grandfather along with many others of his generation had moved to algeria for a better life during the first decades of the th century
hence he was called a slang term for people of french and other european descent born in algeria
his identity and poor background had a substantial effect on his later life
nevertheless camus was a french citizen and enjoyed more rights than arab and berber algerians under indignat
during his childhood he developed a love for football and swimming
under the influence of his teacher louis germain camus gained a scholarship in to continue his studies at a prestigious lyceum near algiers

in he also met simone hi then a partner of a friend of camus who would become his first wife
camus played goalkeeper for the racing universitaire dalger junior team from to
the sense of team spirit fraternity and common purpose appealed to him enormously
in match reports he was often praised for playing with passion and courage
any football ambitions however disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis
camus drew parallels among football human existence morality and personal identity
for him the simplistic morality of football contradicted the complicated morality imposed by authorities such as the state and church
in aged camus was in a relationship with simone hi
simone had an addiction to morphine a drug she used to ease her menstrual pains
his uncle gustave did not approve of the relationship but camus married hi to help her fight her addiction

camus joined the french communist party in early
he saw it as a way to fight inequalities between europeans and natives in algeria even though he was not a marxist
he explained we might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities
camus left the pcf a year later
in the independence minded algerian communist party was founded and camus joined it after his mentor grenier advised him to do so
camuss main role within the pca was to organise the thtre du travail
camus was also close to the parti du peuple algrien which was a moderate anti colonialist nationalist party
as tensions in the interwar period escalated the stalinist pca and ppa broke ties
camus was expelled from the pca for refusing to toe the party line
this series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity
camuss mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew
he continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group thtre de lequipe
some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels
in camus began working for the leftist newspaper alger rpublicain as he had strong anti fascist feelings and the rise of fascist regimes in europe was worrying him
by then camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative colonialism as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the arabs and berbers by french authorities
alger rpublicain was banned in and camus flew to paris to take a new job at paris soir as editor in chief
in paris he almost completed his first cycle of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless the novel ltranger or the stranger the philosophical essay le mythe de sisyphe and the play caligula
each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a theatrical play
soon after camus moved to paris the outbreak of world war ii began to affect france
camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he once had tuberculosis
as the germans were marching towards paris camus fled
he was laid off from paris soir and ended up in lyon where he married pianist and mathematician francine faure on december
camus and faure moved back to algeria where he taught in primary schools
because of his tuberculosis he moved to the french alps on medical advice
there he began writing his second cycle of works this time dealing with revolt a novel la peste and a play le malentendu
by he was known because of his earlier work
he returned to paris where he met and became friends with jean paul sartre
he also became part of a circle of intellectuals including simone de beauvoir andr breton and others
among them was the actress mara casares who would later have an affair with camus
camus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the germans during the french occupation
upon his arrival in paris he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper combat
he continued writing for the paper after the liberation of france
camus used a pseudonym for his combat articles and used false id cards to avoid being captured
during that period he composed four lettres un ami allemand explaining why resistance was necessary
after the war camus lived in paris with faure who gave birth to twins catherine and jean in
camus was now a celebrated writer known for his role in the resistance
he gave lectures at various universities in the united states and latin america during two separate trips
he also visited algeria once more only to leave disappointed by the continued oppressive colonial policies which he had warned about many times
during this period he completed the second cycle of his work with the essay lhomme rvolt
camus attacked totalitarian communism while advocating libertarian socialism and anarcho syndicalism
upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in france with his rejection of communism the book brought about the final split with sartre
his relations with the marxist left deteriorated further during the algerian war
camus was a strong supporter of european integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end
in he founded the comit franais pour la fderation europenne declaring that europe can only evolve along the path of economic progress democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation
in he founded the groupes de liaison internationale a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism
his main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of andr breton
camus also raised his voice against the soviet intervention in hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of francos regime in spain
camus had numerous affairs particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the spanish born actress mara casares with whom he had extensive correspondence
faure did not take this affair lightly
she had a mental breakdown and needed hospitalisation in the early s
camus who felt guilty withdrew from public life and was slightly depressed for some time
in camus received the news that he was to be awarded the nobel prize in literature
this came as a shock to him
he was anticipating andr malraux would win the prestigious award
at age he was the second youngest recipient of the prize after rudyard kipling who was
after this he began working on his autobiography le premier homme in an attempt to examine moral learning
he also turned to the theatre once more
financed by the money he received with his nobel prize he adapted and directed for the stage dostoyevskys novel demons
the play opened in january at the antoine theatre in paris and was a critical success
during these years he published posthumously the works of the philosopher simone weil in the series espoir which he had founded for ditions gallimard
weil had great influence on his philosophy since he saw her writings as an antidote to nihilism
camus described her as the only great spirit of our times
camus died on january at the age of in a car accident near sens in le grand fossard in the small town of villeblevin
he had spent the new years holiday of at his house in lourmarin vaucluse with his family and his publisher michel gallimard of ditions gallimard along with gallimards wife janine and daughter
camuss wife and children went back to paris by train on january but camus decided to return in gallimards luxurious facel vega fv
the car crashed into a plane tree on a long straight stretch of the route nationale
camus who was in the passenger seat died instantly
gallimard died a few days later although his wife and daughter were unharmed
pages of a handwritten manuscript entitled le premier homme were found in the wreckage
camus had predicted that this unfinished novel based on his childhood in algeria would be his finest work
camus was buried in the lourmarin cemetery vaucluse france where he had lived
his friend sartre read a eulogy paying tribute to camuss heroic stubborn humanism
william faulkner wrote his obituary saying when the door shut for him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death is hoping to do i was here
camuss first publication was a play called rvolte dans les asturies written with three friends in may
the subject was the revolt by spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the spanish government resulting in to deaths
in may he wrote his first book lenvers et lendroit
both were published by edmond charlots small publishing house
camus separated his work into three cycles
each cycle consisted of a novel an essay and a play
the first was the cycle of the absurd consisting of ltranger le mythe de sysiphe and caligula
the second was the cycle of the revolt which included la peste lhomme rvolt and les justes
the third the cycle of the love consisted of nemesis
each cycle was an examination of a theme with the use of a pagan myth and including biblical motifs
the books in the first cycle were published between and but the theme was conceived earlier at least as far back as
with this cycle camus aims to pose a question on the human condition discuss the world as an absurd place and warn humanity of the consequences of totalitarianism
camus began his work on the second cycle while he was in algeria in the last months of just as the germans were reaching north africa
in the second cycle camus used prometheus who is depicted as a revolutionary humanist to highlight the nuances between revolution and rebellion
he analyses various aspects of rebellion its metaphysics its connection to politics and examines it under the lens of modernity of historicity and the absence of a god
after receiving the nobel prize camus gathered clarified and published his pacifist leaning views at actuelles iii chronique algrienne
he then decided to distance himself from the algerian war as he found the mental burden too heavy
he turned to theatre and the third cycle which was about love and the goddess nemesis the greek and roman goddess of revenge
two of camuss works were published posthumously
the first entitled la mort heureuse features a character named patrice mersault comparable to the strangers meursault
there is scholarly debate about the relationship between the two books
the second was an unfinished novel le premier homme which camus was writing before he died
it was an autobiographical work about his childhood in algeria and its publication in sparked a widespread reconsideration of camuss allegedly unrepentant colonialism
camus was a moralist he claimed morality should guide politics
while he did not deny that morals change over time he rejected the classical marxist view that historical material relations define morality
camus was also strongly critical of marxism leninism especially in the case of the soviet union which he considered totalitarian
camus rebuked those sympathetic to the soviet model and their decision to call total servitude freedom
a proponent of libertarian socialism he claimed the ussr was not socialist and the united states was not liberal
his critique of the ussr caused him to clash with others on the political left most notably with his on again off again friend jean paul sartre
active in the french resistance to the nazi occupation of france during world war ii camus wrote for and edited the resistance journal combat
of the french collaboration with the german occupiers he wrote now the only moral value is courage which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people
after frances liberation camus remarked this country does not need a talleyrand but a saint just
the reality of the postwar tribunals soon changed his mind camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment
camus had anarchist sympathies which intensified in the s when he came to believe that the soviet model was morally bankrupt
camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation authority property the state and centralization
he however opposed revolution separating the rebel from the revolutionary and believing that the belief in absolute truth most often assuming the guise of history or reason inspires the revolutionary and leads to tragic results
he believed that rebellion is spurred by our outrage over the worlds lack of transcendent significance while political rebellion is our response to attacks against the dignity and autonomy of the individual
camus opposed political violence tolerating it only in rare and very narrowly defined instances as well as revolutionary terror which he accused of sacrificing innocent lives on the altar of history
philosophy professor david sherman considers camus an anarcho syndicalist
graeme nicholson considers camus an existentialist anarchist
the anarchist andr prudhommeaux first introduced him at a meeting of the cercle des tudiants anarchistes in as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought
camus wrote for anarchist publications such as le libertaire la rvolution proltarienne and solidaridad obrera the organ of the anarcho syndicalist confederacin nacional del trabajo
camus kept a neutral stance during the algerian revolution
while he was against the violence of the national liberation front he acknowledged the injustice and brutalities imposed by colonialist france
he was supportive of pierre mends unified socialist party and its approach to the crisis mendes advocated reconciliation
camus also supported a like minded algerian militant aziz kessous
camus traveled to algeria to negotiate a truce between the two belligerents but was met with distrust by all parties
in one often misquoted incident camus confronted an algerian critic during his nobel prize acceptance speech in stockholm rejecting the false equivalence of justice with revolutionary terrorism people are now planting bombs in the tramways of algiers
my mother might be on one of those tramways
if that is justice then i prefer my mother
camuss critics have labelled the response as reactionary and a result of a colonialist attitude
he was sharply critical of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki
in the s camus devoted his efforts to human rights
in he resigned from his work for unesco when the un accepted spain under the leadership of the caudillo general francisco franco as a member
camus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world
he wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with arthur koestler the writer intellectual and founder of the league against capital punishment entitled rflexions sur la peine capitale published by calmann levy in
born in algeria to french parents camus was familiar with the institutional racism of france against arabs and berbers but he was not part of a rich elite
he lived in very poor conditions as a child but was a citizen of france and as such was entitled to citizens rights members of the countrys arab and berber majority were not
camus was a vocal advocate of the new mediterranean culture
this was his vision of embracing the multi ethnicity of the algerian people in opposition to latiny a popular pro fascist and antisemitic ideology among other pieds noirs or french or europeans born in algeria
for camus this vision encapsulated the hellenic humanism which survived among ordinary people around the mediterranean sea
his address on the new mediterranean culture represents camuss most systematic statement of his views at this time
camus also supported the blum viollette proposal to grant algerians full french citizenship in a manifesto with arguments defending this assimilative proposal on radical egalitarian grounds
in camus wrote a stinging series of articles for the alger rpublicain on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the kabylie highlands
he advocated for economic educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency
in following the stif and guelma massacre after arab revolts against french mistreatment camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony
he wrote a series of articles reporting on conditions and advocating for french reforms and concessions to the demands of the algerian people
when the algerian war began in camus was confronted with a moral dilemma
he identified with the pieds noirs such as his own parents and defended the french governments actions against the revolt
he argued the algerian uprising was an integral part of the new arab imperialism led by egypt and an anti western offensive orchestrated by russia to encircle europe and isolate the united states
although favoring greater algerian autonomy or even federation though not full scale independence he believed the pieds noirs and arabs could co exist
during the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians
it was rejected by both sides who regarded it as foolish
behind the scenes he began working for imprisoned algerians who faced the death penalty
his position drew much criticism from the left and later postcolonial literary critics such as edward said who were opposed to european imperialism and charged that camuss novels and short stories are plagued with colonial depictions or conscious erasures of algerias arab population
in their eyes camus was no longer the defender of the oppressed
camus once said that the troubles in algeria affected him as others feel pain in their lungs
even though camus is mostly connected to absurdism he is routinely categorized as an existentialist a term he rejected on several occasions
camus himself said his philosophical origins lay in ancient greek philosophy nietzsche and th century moralists whereas existentialism arises from th and early th century philosophy such as kierkegaard karl jaspers and heidegger
he also said his work the myth of sisyphus was a criticism of various aspects of existentialism
camus was rejecting existentialism as a philosophy but his critique was mostly focused on sartrean existentialism and to a lesser extent on religious existentialism
he thought that the importance of history held by marx and sartre was incompatible with his belief in human freedom
david sherman and others also suggest the rivalry between sartre and camus also played a part in his rejection of existentialism
david simpson argues further that his humanism and belief in human nature set him apart from the existentialist doctrine that existence precedes essence
on the other hand camus focused most of his philosophy around existential questions
the absurdity of life the inevitable ending is highlighted in his acts
his belief was that the absurd life being void of meaning or mans inability to know that meaning if it were to exist was something that man should embrace
his anti christianity his commitment to individual moral freedom and responsibility are only a few of the similarities with other existential writers
more importantly camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism the problem of suicide
he wrote there is only one really serious philosophical question and that is suicide
camus viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life
many existentialist writers have addressed the absurd each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important
kierkegaard explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching god rationally
sartre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience
camuss thoughts on the absurd begin with his first cycle of books and the literary essay the myth of sisyphus his major work on the subject
in he published the story of a man living an absurd life in the stranger
he also wrote a play about the roman emperor caligula pursuing an absurd logic which was not performed until
his early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays lenvers et lendroit in
absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays noces in
in these essays camus reflects on the experience of the absurd
aspects of the notion of the absurd can be found in the plague
camus follows sartres definition of the absurd that which is meaningless
thus mans existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification
the absurd is created because man who is placed in an unintelligent universe realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component or as camus himself explains the absurd is the result of the confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world
even though absurdity is inescapable camus does not drift towards nihilism
but the realization of absurdity leads to the question why should someone continue to live suicide is an option that camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom
rather he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it
the turning point in camuss attitude to the absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous german friend written between july and july
the first was published in the revue libre in the second in the cahiers de libration in and the third in the newspaper liberts in
the four letters were published as lettres un ami allemand in and were included in the collection resistance rebellion and death
camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a philosopher of the absurd
he showed less interest in the absurd shortly after publishing le mythe de sisyphe
to distinguish his ideas scholars sometimes refer to the paradox of the absurd when referring to camuss absurd
camus is known for articulating the case for revolting against any kind of oppression injustice or whatever disrespects the human condition
he is cautious enough however to set the limits on the rebellion
lhomme rvolt explains in detail his thoughts on the issue
there he builds upon the absurd but goes further
in the introduction where he examines the metaphysics of rebellion he concludes with the phrase i revolt therefore we exist implying the recognition of a common human condition
camus also delineates the difference between revolution and rebellion and notices that history has shown that the rebels revolution might easily end up as an oppressive regime he therefore places importance on the morals accompanying the revolution
camus poses a crucial question is it possible for humans to act in an ethical and meaningful manner in a silent universe according to him the answer is yes as the experience and awareness of the absurd creates the moral values and also sets the limits of our actions
camus separates the modern form of rebellion into two modes
first there is the metaphysical rebellion which is the movement by which man protests against his condition and against the whole of creation
the other mode historical rebellion is the attempt to materialize the abstract spirit of metaphysical rebellion and change the world
in this attempt the rebel must balance between the evil of the world and the intrinsic evil which every revolt carries and not cause any unjustifiable suffering
camuss novels and philosophical essays are still influential
after his death interest in camus followed the rise of the new left
following the collapse of the soviet union interest in his alternative road to communism resurfaced
he is remembered for his skeptical humanism and his support for political tolerance dialogue and civil rights
although camus has been linked to anti soviet communism reaching as far as anarcho syndicalism some neo liberals have tried to associate him with their policies for instance the french president nicolas sarkozy suggested that his remains be moved to the panthon an idea that was criticised by camuss surviving family and angered many on the left
american heavy metal band avenged sevenfold has stated their album life is but a dream
is inspired by the work of camus

christies autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance
two doctors diagnosed her with an unquestionable genuine loss of memory yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance
some including her biographer morgan believe she disappeared during a fugue state
the author jared cade concluded that christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama
christie biographer laura thompson provides an alternative view that christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself
public reaction at the time was largely negative supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder

one christie compendium notes that abney became agathas greatest inspiration for country house life with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots
the descriptions of the fictional chimneys stonygates and other houses in her stories are mostly abney hall in various forms
during world war ii christie moved to london and lived in a flat at the isokon in hampstead whilst working in the pharmacy at university college hospital london where she updated her knowledge of poisons

the british intelligence agency mi investigated christie after a character called major bletchley appeared in her thriller n or m which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime england
mi was concerned that christie had a spy in britains top secret codebreaking centre bletchley park
the agencys fears were allayed when christie told her friend the codebreaker dilly knox i was stuck there on my way by train from oxford to london and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters

in when christie was almost she sold a stake in agatha christie limited to booker books which by had increased its stake to
agatha christie limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than of christies novels and short stories plays and nearly tv films
in the late s christie had reputedly been earning around per year
christie sold an estimated million books during her lifetime
at the time of her death in she was the best selling novelist in history
one estimate of her total earnings from more than a half century of writing is million
as a result of her tax planning her will left only net which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests
her remaining share of agatha christie limited was inherited by hicks who passionately preserved her mothers works image and legacy until her own death years later
the familys share of the company allowed them to appoint of the board and the chairman and retain a veto over new treatments updated versions and republications of her works
in hicks obituary in the telegraph noted that she had been determined to remain true to her mothers vision and to protect the integrity of her creations and disapproved of merchandising activities
upon her death on october the greenway estate passed to her son mathew prichard
after his stepfathers death in prichard donated greenway and its contents to the national trust
christies family and family trusts including great grandson james prichard continue to own the stake in agatha christie limited and remain associated with the company

christies work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations

in rlj entertainment inc
acquired acorn media uk renamed it acorn media enterprises and incorporated it as the rlje uk development arm
in late february media reports stated that the bbc had acquired exclusive tv rights to christies works in the uk and made plans with acorns co operation to air new productions for the th anniversary of christies birth in
as part of that deal the bbc broadcast partners in crime and and then there were none both in
subsequent productions have included the witness for the prosecution but plans to televise ordeal by innocence at christmas were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members
the three part adaptation aired in april
a three part adaptation of the abc murders starring john malkovich and rupert grint began filming in june and was first broadcast in december
a two part adaptation of the pale horse was broadcast on bbc in february
death comes as the end will be the next bbc adaptation
since reissues of christies miss marple and hercule poirot novels by harpercollins have removed passages containing descriptions insults or references to ethnicity
christies first published book the mysterious affair at styles was released in and introduced the detective hercule poirot who appeared in of her novels and more than short stories
over the years christie grew tired of poirot much as doyle did with sherlock holmes
by the end of the s christie wrote in her diary that she was finding poirot insufferable and by the s she felt he was an egocentric creep
thompson believes christies occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated and points out that in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood
unlike doyle she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular
she married off poirots watson captain arthur hastings in an attempt to trim her cast commitments
miss jane marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in december and were subsequently collected under the title the thirteen problems
marple was a genteel elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to english village life
christie said miss marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and christies step grandmother margaret miller and her ealing cronies
both marple and miller always expected the worst of everyone and everything and were with almost frightening accuracy usually proved right
marple appeared in novels and stories
during the second world war christie wrote two novels curtain and sleeping murder featuring hercule poirot and miss marple respectively
both books were sealed in a bank vault and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy
christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in after which she was unable to write
her daughter authorised the publication of curtain in and sleeping murder was published posthumously in
these publications followed the success of the film version of murder on the orient express
shortly before the publication of curtain poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in the new york times which was printed on page one on august
christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both poirot and miss marple
in a recording discovered and released in christie revealed the reason for this hercule poirot a complete egoist would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady
hercule poirota professional sleuthwould not be at home at all in miss marples world
in the christie family supported the release of a new poirot story the monogram murders written by british author sophie hannah
hannah later published three more poirot mysteries closed casket in the mystery of three quarters in
and the killings at kingfisher hill in
christie has been called the duchess of death the mistress of mystery and the queen of crime
early in her career a reporter noted that her plots are possible logical and always new
according to hannah at the start of each novel she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering how can this be happening then slowly she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened
christie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the golden age of detective fiction
author dilys winn called christie the doyenne of coziness a sub genre which featured a small village setting a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from paraguay
at the end in a christie hallmark the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room explains the course of their deductive reasoning and reveals the guilty party but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all
christie did not limit herself to quaint english villagesthe action might take place on a small island an aeroplane a train a steamship a smart london flat a resort in the west indies or an archaeological dig but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate family members friends servants business associates fellow travellers
stereotyped characters abound but these may be subverted to stymie the reader impersonations and secret alliances are always possible
there is always a motivemost often money there are very few killers in christie who enjoy murder for its own sake
professor of pharmacology michael c
gerald noted that in over half her novels one or more victims are poisoned albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator
guns knives garrottes tripwires blunt instruments and even a hatchet were also used but christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity according to john curran author and literary adviser to the christie estate
many of her clues are mundane objects a calendar a coffee cup wax flowers a beer bottle a fireplace used during a heat wave
according to crime writer p
james christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party
alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect
christie mocked this insight in her foreword to cards on the table spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished
since i do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust i prefer to warn them beforehand that this is not that kind of book
on bbc radio s desert island discs in brian aldiss said christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter then decided who the most unlikely suspect was after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to frame that person
based upon a study of her working notebooks curran describes how christie would first create a cast of characters choose a setting and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot
of necessity the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel
much of the work particularly dialogue was done in her head before she put it on paper
in the members of the crime writers association chose the murder of roger ackroyd as the best whodunit
ever written
author julian symons observed in an obvious sense the book fits within the conventions
the setting is a village deep within the english countryside roger ackroyd dies in his study there is a butler who behaves suspiciously
every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor who tells the story and acts as poirots watson
critic sutherland scott stated if agatha christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks for writing this novel
in september to mark her th birthday and then there were none was named the worlds favourite christie in a vote sponsored by the authors estate
the novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it
and then there were none carries the closed society type of murder mystery to extreme lengths according to author charles osborne
it begins with the classic set up of potential victim and killer isolated from the outside world but then violates conventions
there is no detective involved in the action no interviews of suspects no careful search for clues and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution
as christie herself said ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious
critics agreed she had succeeded the arrogant mrs christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity
the reviews not surprisingly were without exception wildly adulatory
christie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work especially before particularly in regard to italians jews and non europeans
for example she described men of hebraic extraction sallow men with hooked noses wearing rather flamboyant jewellery in the short story the soul of the croupier from the collection the mysterious mr quin
in the anti defamation league in the us sent an official letter of complaint to christies american publishers dodd mead and company regarding perceived antisemitism in her works
christies british literary agent later wrote to her us representative authorising american publishers to omit the word jew when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books
in the hollow published in one of the characters is described by another as a whitechapel jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake
a small woman with a thick nose henna red and a disagreeable voice
to contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions christie portrayed some foreign characters as victims or potential victims at the hands of english malefactors such as respectively olga seminoff and katrina reiger
jewish characters are often seen as un english but they are rarely the culprits
in the telegraph reported that several agatha christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language including insults and references to ethnicity
poirot and miss marple mysteries written between and have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by harpercollins in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive especially those involving the characters christies protagonists encounter outside the uk
sensitivity readers had made the edits which were evident in digital versions of the new editions including the entire miss marple run and selected poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since
in addition to hercule poirot and miss marple christie also created amateur detectives thomas beresford and his wife prudence tuppence ne cowley who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between and
unlike her other sleuths the beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in the secret adversary and were allowed to age alongside their creator
she treated their stories with a lighter touch giving them a dash and verve which was not universally admired by critics
their last adventure postern of fate was christies last novel
harley quin was easily the most unorthodox of christies fictional detectives
inspired by christies affection for the figures from the harlequinade the semi supernatural quin always works with an elderly conventional man called satterthwaite
the pair appear in short stories of which were collected in as the mysterious mr quin
mallowan described these tales as detection in a fanciful vein touching on the fairy story a natural product of agathas peculiar imagination
satterthwaite also appears in a novel three act tragedy and a short story dead mans mirror both of which feature poirot
another of her lesser known characters is parker pyne a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner
the short stories which introduced him parker pyne investigates are best remembered for the case of the discontented soldier which features ariadne oliver an amusing and satirical self portrait of agatha christie
over the ensuing decades oliver reappeared in seven novels
in most of them she assists poirot
in michael morton adapted the murder of roger ackroyd for the stage under the name of alibi
the play enjoyed a respectable run but christie disliked the changes made to her work and in future preferred to write for the theatre herself
the first of her own stage works was black coffee which received good reviews when it opened in the west end in late
she followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels and then there were none in appointment with death in and the hollow in
in the s the theatre
engaged much of agathas attention
she next adapted her short radio play into the mousetrap which premiered in the west end in produced by peter saunders and starring richard attenborough as the original detective sergeant trotter
her expectations for the play were not high she believed it would run no more than eight months
the mousetrap has long since made theatrical history as the worlds longest running play staging its th performance in september
the play temporarily closed in march when all uk theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic before it re opened on may
in she followed this with witness for the prosecution whose broadway production won the new york drama critics circle award for best foreign play of and earned christie an edgar award from the mystery writers of america
spiders web an original work written for actress margaret lockwood at her request premiered in the west end in and was also a hit
christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in london the mousetrap witness for the prosecution and spiders web
she said plays are much easier to write than books because you can see them in your minds eye you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with whats happening
in a letter to her daughter christie said being a playwright was a lot of fun christie published six mainstream novels under the name mary westmacott a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore her most private and precious imaginative garden
these books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction
of the first giants bread published in a reviewer for the new york times wrote
her book is far above the average of current fiction in fact comes well under the classification of a good book
and it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation
it was publicized from the very beginning that mary westmacott was a pen name of a well known author although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret the dust jacket of giants bread mentions that the author had previously written under her real name
half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales
after christies authorship of the first four westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in she wrote two more the last in
the other westmacott titles are unfinished portrait absent in the spring the rose and the yew tree a daughters a daughter and the burden
christie published few non fiction works
come tell me how you live about working on an archaeological dig was drawn from her life with mallowan
the grand tour around the world with the queen of mystery is a collection of correspondence from her grand tour of the british empire including south africa australia new zealand and canada
was published posthumously in and adjudged the best critical biographical work at the edgar awards
many of christies works from onward have titles drawn from literature with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph
christie biographer gillian gill said christies writing has the sparseness the directness the narrative pace and the universal appeal of the fairy story and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown up children that christies novels succeed
reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror numerous christie titles were drawn from well known childrens nursery rhymes and then there were none one two buckle my shoe five little pigs crooked house a pocket full of rye hickory dickory dock and three blind mice
christie is regularly referred to as the queen of crime which is now trademarked by the christie estate or queen of mystery and is considered a master of suspense plotting and characterisation
in she became the first recipient of the mystery writers of americas grand master award
she was named best writer of the century and the hercule poirot series of books was named best series of the century at the bouchercon world mystery convention
in she was voted best crime writer in a survey of members of the crime writers association of professional novelists
however the writer raymond chandler criticised the artificiality of her books as did writer julian symons
the literary critic edmund wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial
in christie was named by digital crime drama tv channel alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the united kingdom after james bond author ian fleming with total earnings around million
in christie was among the people selected by the artist peter blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work the beatles sgt
peppers lonely hearts club band album cover to celebrate the british cultural figures he most admires
on the record breaking longevity of christies the mousetrap which had marked its th anniversary in stephen moss in the guardian wrote the play and its author are the stars
in marking the th anniversary of her birth date contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on christies works
many of the authors had read christies novels first before other mystery writers in english or in their native language influencing their own writing and nearly all still viewed her as the queen of crime and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors
nearly all had one or more favourites among christies mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly years after her first novel was published
just one of the authors held with wilsons views
in her prime christie was rarely out of the bestseller list

during the first world war christie took a break from nursing to train for the apothecaries hall examination
while she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous and thus less enjoyable than nursing her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs
early in the second world war she brought her skills up to date at torquay hospital
as michael c
gerald puts it her activities as a hospital dispenser during both world wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons
these hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians nurses and pharmacists play in her stories
there were to be many medical practitioners pharmacists and scientists nave or suspicious in christies cast of characters featuring in murder in mesopotamia cards on the table the pale horse and mrs mcgintys dead among many others
gillian gill notes that the murder method in christies first detective novel the mysterious affair at styles comes right out of agatha christies work in the hospital dispensary
in an interview with journalist marcelle bernstein christie stated i dont like messy deaths
im more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why
with her expert knowledge christie had no need of poisons unknown to science which were forbidden under ronald knoxs ten rules for detective fiction
arsenic aconite strychnine digitalis thallium and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades
in her youth christie showed little interest in antiquities
after her marriage to mallowan in she accompanied him on annual expeditions spending three to four months at a time in syria and iraq at excavation sites at ur nineveh tell arpachiyah chagar bazar tell brak and nimrud
the mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites visiting italy greece egypt iran and the soviet union among other places
their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as murder on the orient express death on the nile and appointment with death
for the digging season at nineveh christie bought a writing table to continue her own work in the early s she paid to add a small writing room to the teams house at nimrud
she also devoted time and effort each season in making herself useful by photographing cleaning and recording finds and restoring ceramics which she especially enjoyed
she also provided funds for the expeditions
many of the settings for christies books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the middle east this is reflected in the detail with which she describes themfor instance the temple of abu simbel as depicted in death on the nilewhile the settings for they came to baghdad were places she and mallowan had recently stayed
similarly she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout murder in mesopotamia
archaeologists and experts in middle eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include dr eric leidner in murder in mesopotamia and signor richetti in death on the nile
after the second world war christie chronicled her time in syria in come tell me how you live which she described as small beera very little book full of everyday doings and happenings

according to an academic study oran was decimated by the bubonic plague in and but all later outbreaks were very far from the scale of the epidemic described in the novel
the plague is considered an existentialist classic despite camus objection to the label
the novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies
the narrative tone is similar to kafkas especially in the trial whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition
the book begins with an epigraph quoting daniel defoe author of a journal of the plague year
in the town of oran thousands of rats initially unnoticed by the populace begin to die in the streets
hysteria develops soon afterward causing the local newspapers to report the incident
authorities responding to public pressure order the collection and cremation of the rats unaware that the collection itself was the catalyst for the spread of the bubonic plague
the main character dr bernard rieux lives comfortably in an apartment building when strangely the buildings concierge m
michel a confidante dies from a fever
dr rieux consults his colleague dr castel about the illness until they come to the conclusion that a plague is sweeping the town
they both approach fellow doctors and town authorities about their theory but are eventually dismissed on the basis of one death
however as more deaths quickly ensue it becomes apparent that there is an epidemic
meanwhile rieuxs wife has been sent to a sanatorium in another city to be treated for an unrelated chronic illness
authorities including the prefect are slow to accept that the situation is serious and quibble over the appropriate action to take
official notices enacting control measures are posted but the language used is optimistic and downplays the seriousness of the situation
a special ward is opened at the hospital but its beds are filled within three days
as the death toll begins to rise more desperate measures are taken
homes are quarantined corpses and burials are strictly supervised
a supply of plague serum finally arrives but there is enough to treat only existing cases and the countrys emergency reserves are depleted
when the daily number of deaths jumps to the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared
the town is sealed off
the town gates are shut rail travel is prohibited and all mail service is suspended
the use of telephone lines is restricted only to urgent calls leaving short telegrams as the only means of communicating with friends or family outside the town
the separation affects daily activity and depresses the spirit of the townspeople who begin to feel isolated and introverted and the plague begins to affect various characters
one character raymond rambert devises a plan to escape the city to join his wife in paris after city officials refused his request to leave
he befriends some underground criminals so that they may smuggle him out of the city
another character father paneloux uses the plague as an opportunity to advance his stature in the town by suggesting that the plague was an act of god punishing the citizens sinful nature
his diatribe falls on the ears of many citizens of the town who turned to religion in droves but would not have done so under normal circumstances
cottard a criminal remorseful enough to attempt suicide but fearful of being arrested becomes wealthy as a major smuggler
meanwhile jean tarrou a vacationer joseph grand a civil engineer and dr rieux exhaustively treat patients in their homes and in the hospital
rambert informs tarrou of his escape plan but when tarrou tells him that there are others in the city including dr rieux who have loved ones outside the city whom they are not allowed to see rambert becomes sympathetic and offers to help rieux fight the epidemic until he leaves town
in mid august the situation continues to worsen
people try to escape the town but some are shot by armed sentries
violence and looting break out on a small scale and the authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew
funerals are conducted with more speed no ceremony and little concern for the feelings of the families of the deceased
the inhabitants passively endure their increasing feelings of exile and separation
despondent they waste away emotionally as well as physically
in september and october the town remains at the mercy of the plague
rieux hears from the sanatorium that his wifes condition is worsening
he also hardens his heart regarding the plague victims so that he can continue to do his work
cottard on the other hand seems to flourish during the plague because it gives him a sense of being connected to others since everybody faces the same danger
cottard and tarrou attend a performance of glucks opera orpheus and eurydice but the actor portraying orpheus collapses with plague symptoms during the performance
after extended negotiations with guards rambert finally has a chance to escape but he decides to stay saying that he would feel ashamed of himself if he left
towards the end of october castels new antiplague serum is tried for the first time but it cannot save the life of othons young son who suffers greatly as paneloux rieux and tarrou tend to his bedside in horror
paneloux who has joined the group of volunteers fighting the plague gives a second sermon
he addresses the problem of an innocent childs suffering and says it is a test of a christians faith since it requires him either to deny everything or believe everything
he urges the congregation not to give up the struggle but to do everything possible to fight the plague
a few days after the sermon paneloux is taken ill
his symptoms do not conform to those of the plague but the disease still proves fatal
tarrou and rambert visit one of the isolation camps where they meet othon
when othons period of quarantine ends he chooses to stay in the camp as a volunteer because this will make him feel less separated from his dead son
tarrou tells rieux the story of his life and to take their mind off the epidemic the two men go swimming together in the sea
grand catches the plague and instructs rieux to burn all his papers
however grand makes an unexpected recovery and deaths from the plague start to decline
by late january the plague is in full retreat and the townspeople begin to celebrate the imminent opening of the town gates
othon however does not escape death from the disease
cottard is distressed by the ending of the epidemic from which he has profited by shady dealings
two government employees approach him and he flees
despite the epidemics ending tarrou contracts the plague and dies after a heroic struggle
rieux is later informed via telegram that his wife has also died
in february the town gates open and people are reunited with their loved ones from other cities
rambert is reunited with his wife
cottard goes mad and shoots at people from his home and is soon arrested after a brief skirmish with the police
grand begins working on his novel again
the narrator of the chronicle says that he is dr rieux and states that he tried to present an objective view of the events
he reflects on the epidemic and declares he wrote the chronicle to simply say what we learn in the midst of plagues there are more things to admire in men than to despise
germaine bre has characterised the struggle of the characters against the plague as undramatic and stubborn and in contrast to the ideology of glorification of power in the novels of andr malraux whereas camus characters are obscurely engaged in saving not destroying and this in the name of no ideology
lulu haroutunian has discussed camus own medical history including a bout with tuberculosis and how it informs the novel
marina warner notes its larger philosophical themes of engagement paltriness and generosity small heroism and large cowardice and all kinds of profoundly humanist problems such as love and goodness happiness and mutual connection
thomas l hanna and john loose have separately discussed themes related to christianity in the novel with particular respect to father paneloux and dr rieux
louis r rossi briefly discusses the role of tarrou in the novel and the sense of philosophical guilt behind his character
elwyn sterling has analysed the role of cottard and his final actions at the end of the novel
father paneloux has been subject to several literary analyses in the context of faith faced with great suffering
dr rieux has been described as a classic example of an idealist doctor
he has also been an inspiration to the life and career of the french doctor and also to the fictional character of jeanne dion starring in the movie trilogy directed by bernard mond
medically trained readers are sometimes upset that dr rieux and dr castel make no effort to get their patients sulfa drugs which were available and known to be effective against plague
instead the doctors waste time and effort attempting to obtain plague antiserum which was much less effective and in fact was rapidly being abandoned during the s
the novel has been read as an allegorical treatment of the french resistance to nazi occupation during world war ii
the novel became a bestseller during the worldwide covid pandemic of to the point that its british publisher penguin classics reported struggling to keep up with demand
the prescience of the fictional cordon sanitaire of oran with real life covid lockdowns worldwide brought revived popular attention
sales in italy tripled and it became a top ten bestseller during its nationwide lockdown
penguin classics editorial director said it couldnt be more relevant to the current moment and camus daughter catherine said that the message of the novel had newfound relevance in that we are not responsible for coronavirus but we can be responsible in the way we respond to it
as early as april camus had been working on the novel as evidenced in his diaries in which he wrote down a few ideas on the redeeming plague
on march he informed andr malraux that he was writing a novel on the plague adding said like that it might sound strange but this subject seems so natural to me
applied ethics refers to the practical aspect of moral considerations
it is ethics with respect to real world actions and their moral considerations in the areas of private and public life the professions health technology law and leadership
for example the bioethics community is concerned with identifying the correct approach to moral issues in the life sciences such as euthanasia the allocation of scarce health resources or the use of human embryos in research
environmental ethics is concerned with ecological issues such as the responsibility of government and corporations to clean up pollution
business ethics includes questions regarding the duties or duty of whistleblowers to the general public or their loyalty to their employers
applied ethics has expanded the study of ethics beyond the realms of academic philosophical discourse
the field of applied ethics as it appears today emerged from debate surrounding rapid medical and technological advances in the early s and is now established as a subdiscipline of moral philosophy
however applied ethics is by its very nature a multi professional subject because it requires specialist understanding of the potential ethical issues in fields like medicine business or information technology
nowadays ethical codes of conduct exist in almost every profession
an applied ethics approach to the examination of moral dilemmas can take many different forms but one of the most influential and most widely utilised approaches in bioethics and health care ethics is the four principle approach developed by tom beauchamp and james childress
the four principle approach commonly termed principlism entails consideration and application of four prima facie ethical principles autonomy non maleficence beneficence and justice
applied ethics is distinguished from normative ethics which concerns standards for right and wrong behavior and from meta ethics which concerns the nature of ethical properties statements attitudes and judgments
whilst these three areas of ethics appear to be distinct they are also interrelated
the use of an applied ethics approach often draws upon these normative ethical theories normative ethical theories can clash when trying to resolve real world ethical dilemmas
one approach attempting to overcome the divide between consequentialism and deontology is case based reasoning also known as casuistry
casuistry does not begin with theory rather it starts with the immediate facts of a real and concrete case
while casuistry makes use of ethical theory it does not view ethical theory as the most important feature of moral reasoning
casuists like albert jonsen and stephen toulmin challenge the traditional paradigm of applied ethics
instead of starting from theory and applying theory to a particular case casuists start with the particular case itself and then ask what morally significant features ought to be considered for that particular case
in their observations of medical ethics committees jonsen and toulmin note that a consensus on particularly problematic moral cases often emerges when participants focus on the facts of the case rather than on ideology or theory
thus a rabbi a catholic priest and an agnostic might agree that in this particular case the best approach is to withhold extraordinary medical care while disagreeing on the reasons that support their individual positions
by focusing on cases and not on theory those engaged in moral debate increase the possibility of agreement
applied ethics was later distinguished from the nascent applied epistemology which is also under the umbrella of applied philosophy
while the former was concerned with the practical application of moral considerations the latter focuses on the application of epistemology in solving practical problems
in mathematics the absolute value or modulus of a real number formula is the non negative value without regard to its sign
namely formula if formula is a positive number and formula if formula is negative and for example the absolute value of and the absolute value of is the absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero
generalisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings
for example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers the quaternions ordered rings fields and vector spaces
the absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude distance and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts
in jean robert argand introduced the term module meaning unit of measure in french specifically for the complex absolute value and it was borrowed into english in as the latin equivalent modulus
the term absolute value has been used in this sense from at least in french and in english
the notation with a vertical bar on each side was introduced by karl weierstrass in
other names for absolute value include numerical value and magnitude
in programming languages and computational software packages the absolute value of x is generally represented by codice or a similar expression
the vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts for example when applied to a set it denotes its cardinality when applied to a matrix it denotes its determinant
vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined notably an element of a normed division algebra for example a real number a complex number or a quaternion
a closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the euclidean norm or sup norm of a vector although double vertical bars with subscripts respectively are a more common and less ambiguous notation
for any the absolute value or modulus is denoted with a vertical bar on each side of the quantity and is defined as formula the absolute value is thus always either a positive number or zero but never negative
when formula itself is negative then its absolute value is necessarily positive from an analytic geometry point of view the absolute value of a real number is that numbers distance from zero along the real number line and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them
the notion of an abstract distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference
since the square root symbol represents the unique positive square root when applied to a positive number it follows that formula this is equivalent to the definition above and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers
non negativity positive definiteness and multiplicativity are readily apparent from the definition
to see that subadditivity holds first note that formula with its sign chosen to make the result positive
now since formula it follows that whichever of formula is the value one has formula for all consequently formula as desired
some additional useful properties are given below
these are either immediate consequences of the definition or implied by the four fundamental properties above
these relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values
for example the absolute value as distance from zero is used to define the absolute difference between arbitrary real numbers the standard metric on the real numbers
since the complex numbers are not ordered the definition given at the top for the real absolute value cannot be directly applied to complex numbers
however the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from can be generalised
the absolute value of a complex number is defined by the euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the complex plane from the origin
this can be computed using the pythagorean theorem for any complex number formula where formula and formula are real numbers the absolute value or modulus is and is defined by formula the pythagorean addition of formula and formula where formula and formula denote the real and imaginary parts respectively
when the is zero this coincides with the definition of the absolute value of the when a complex number formula is expressed in its polar form its absolute value since the product of any complex number formula and its with the same absolute value is always the non negative real number the absolute value of a complex number formula is the square root which is therefore called the absolute square or squared modulus formula the complex absolute value shares the four fundamental properties given above for the real absolute value
the identity formula is a special case of multiplicativity that is often useful by itself
the real absolute value function is continuous everywhere
it is differentiable everywhere except for
it is monotonically decreasing on the interval and monotonically increasing on the interval
since a real number and its opposite have the same absolute value it is an even function and is hence not invertible
the real absolute value function is a piecewise linear convex function
for both real and complex numbers the absolute value function is idempotent
the absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign whereas the sign function returns a numbers sign irrespective of its value
the following equations show the relationship between these two functions or and for the real absolute value function has a derivative for every but is not differentiable at
its derivative for is given by the step function the real absolute value function is an example of a continuous function that achieves a global minimum where the derivative does not exist
the subdifferential of at is the interval
the complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable nowhere because it violates the cauchy riemann equations
the second derivative of with respect to is zero everywhere except zero where it does not exist
as a generalised function the second derivative may be taken as two times the dirac delta function
the antiderivative of the real absolute value function is where is an arbitrary constant of integration
this is not a complex antiderivative because complex antiderivatives can only exist for complex differentiable functions which the complex absolute value function is not
the absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance
as noted above the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin along the real number line for real numbers or in the complex plane for complex numbers and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them
the standard euclidean distance between two points and this can be seen as a generalisation since for formula and formula real ie in a space according to the alternative definition of the absolute value and for formula and formula complex numbers ie in a space the above shows that the absolute value distance for real and complex numbers agrees with the standard euclidean distance which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two dimensional euclidean spaces respectively
the definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring
that is if is an element of an ordered ring r then the absolute value of denoted by is defined to be where is the additive inverse of is the additive identity and n
every field f has some extension which is algebraically closed
such an extension is called an algebraically closed extension
among all such extensions there is one and only one which is an algebraic extension of f it is called the algebraic closure of f
the theory of algebraically closed fields has quantifier elimination
anatoly yevgenyevich karpov is a russian and former soviet chess grandmaster former world chess champion and politician
he was the th world chess champion from to a three time fide world champion twice world chess champion as a member of the ussr team and a six time winner of chess olympiads as a member of the ussr team
the international association of chess press awarded him nine chess oscars
karpovs chess tournament successes include over first place finishes
he had a peak elo rating of and his total months at world number one is the third longest of all time behind magnus carlsen and garry kasparov since the inception of the fide ranking list in
karpov is also an elected member of the state duma in russia
since he has chaired the commission for ecological safety and environmental protection of the civic chamber of the russian federation and since he has been a member of the public council under the ministry of defence
karpov was born into a russian family on may in zlatoust in the urals region of the former soviet union and learned to play chess at the age of four
his early rise in chess was swift as he became a candidate master by age
at he was accepted into mikhail botvinniks prestigious chess school though botvinnik made the following remark about the young karpov the boy does not have a clue about chess and theres no future at all for him in this profession
karpov acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time and later wrote that the homework botvinnik assigned greatly helped him since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently
karpov improved so quickly under botvinniks tutelage that he became the youngest soviet master in history at the age of fifteen in this tied the record established by boris spassky in
karpov finished first in his first international tournament in tinec several months later ahead of viktor kupreichik
in he won the annual niemeyer tournament in groningen
karpov won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school and entered moscow state university in to study mathematics
he later transferred to leningrad state university eventually graduating from there in economics
one reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach grandmaster semyon furman who lived in leningrad
in his writings karpov credits furman as a major influence on his development as a world class player
in karpov became the first soviet player since spassky to win the world junior championship scoring an undefeated in the final a group at stockholm
this victory earned him the international master title
in karpov tied for fourth and fifth places with pal benko at an international tournament in caracas venezuela and earned the international grandmaster title
fide awarded him the title during its st congress held during the chess olympiad in siegen west germany in september
karpov won the alekhine memorial tournament in moscow ahead of a star studded field for his first significant adult victory
his elo rating shot from in to in during which he shared second place in the soviet championship one point behind spassky and qualified for the leningrad interzonal
karpovs world junior championship qualified him for one of the two interzonals a stage in the world championship cycle to choose the challenger to play world champion bobby fischer
he finished equal first in the leningrad interzonal qualifying for the candidates matches
karpov defeated lev polugaevsky by the score of in the first candidates match earning the right to face former champion boris spassky in the semifinal round
karpov was on record saying that he believed spassky would easily beat him and win the candidates cycle to face fischer and that he would win the following candidates cycle in
spassky won the first game as black in good style but tenacious aggressive play from karpov secured him overall victory by
the candidates final was played in moscow with victor korchnoi
karpov took an early lead winning the second game against the sicilian dragon then scoring another victory in the sixth game
following ten consecutive draws korchnoi threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give karpov a lead
in game korchnoi succeeded in winning a long endgame then notched a speedy victory after a blunder by karpov two games later
three more draws the last agreed by karpov with karpov in a clearly better position closed the match as he thus prevailed moving on to challenge fischer for the world title
though a world championship match between karpov and fischer was highly anticipated those hopes were never realised
fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins but also that the champion retain the crown if the score was tied
fide the international chess federation refused to allow this proviso and gave both players a deadline of april to agree to play the match under the fide approved rules
when fischer did not agree fide president max euwe declared on april that fischer had forfeited his title and karpov was the new world champion
karpov later attempted to set up another match with fischer but the negotiations fell through
this thrust the young karpov into the role of world champion without having faced the reigning champion
garry kasparov argued that karpov would have had good chances because he had beaten spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional and indeed had higher quality games while fischer had been inactive for three years
this view is echoed by karpov himself
spassky thought that fischer would have won in but karpov would have qualified again and beaten fischer in
karpov has said that if he had had the opportunity to play fischer for the championship in his twenties he could have been a much better player as a result
determined to prove himself a legitimate champion karpov participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years
he convincingly won the milan tournament in and captured his first of three soviet titles in
he created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world
karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories until it was shattered by garry kasparov
as a result most chess professionals soon agreed that karpov was a legitimate world champion
in karpovs first title defence was against viktor korchnoi the opponent he had defeated in the candidates cycle the match was played at baguio philippines with the winner needing six victories
as in karpov took an early lead winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match
when the score was in karpovs favour korchnoi staged a comeback and won three of the next four games to draw level with karpov
karpov then won the very next game to retain the title
three years later korchnoi reemerged as the candidates winner against german finalist robert hbner to challenge karpov in merano italy
karpov handily won this match in what is remembered as the massacre in merano
karpovs tournament career reached a peak at the montreal tournament of stars tournament in where he finished joint first with mikhail tal ahead of a field of strong grandmasters completed by jan timman ljubomir ljubojevi boris spassky vlastimil hort lajos portisch robert hbner bent larsen and lubomir kavalek
he dominated las palmas in with
he also won the prestigious bugojno tournament in and the linares tournament in and the tilburg tournament in and and the soviet championship in and
karpov represented the soviet union at six chess olympiads in all of which the ussr won the team gold medal
he played as the first reserve at skopje winning the board prize with
at nice he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with
at la valletta he was again board one and scored
at lucerne he scored on board one
at dubai he scored on board two
his last was thessaloniki where on board two he scored
in olympiad play karpov lost only two games out of played
to illustrate karpovs dominance over his peers as champion his score was versus spassky versus robert hbner versus ulf andersson versus vasily smyslov versus mikhail tal versus ljubomir ljubojevi
karpov had cemented his position as the worlds best player and world champion by the time garry kasparov arrived on the scene
in their first match the world chess championship in moscow the first player to win six games would win the match
karpov built a lead after nine games
the next games were drawn setting a record for world title matches and it took karpov until game to gain his fifth win
in game karpov had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw
he lost the next game after which more draws ensued
karpov held a solidly winning position in game but again blundered and had to settle for a draw
after kasparov won games and fide president florencio campomanes unilaterally terminated the match citing the players health
karpov is said to have lost kg over the course of the match
the match had lasted an unprecedented five months with five wins for karpov three for kasparov and draws
a rematch was set for later in also in moscow
the events of the so called marathon match forced fide to return to the previous format with a match limited to games
karpov needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title but lost surrendering the title to his opponent
the final score was in favour of kasparov
karpov remained a formidable opponent until the mid s
he fought kasparov in three more world championship matches in and
all three matches were extremely close the scores were and
in all three matches karpov had winning chances up to the last games
the ending of the seville match was particularly dramatic
karpov won the rd game when kasparov miscalculated a combination
in the final game needing only a draw to win the title karpov cracked under time pressure at the end of the first session of play missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw and allowed kasparov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn
after a further mistake in the second session karpov was slowly ground down and resigned on move ending the match and allowing kasparov to keep the title
in their five world championship matches karpov scored wins losses and draws in games
overall karpov played five matches against kasparov for the title from to without ever defeating him in a match
in karpov lost a candidates match against nigel short
but in the world chess championship karpov reacquired the fide world champion title when kasparov and short split from fide
karpov defeated timman the loser of the candidates final against short
the next major meeting of kasparov and karpov was the linares chess tournament
the field in eventual finishing order was karpov kasparov shirov bareev kramnik lautier anand kamsky topalov ivanchuk gelfand illescas judit polgr and beliavsky with an average elo rating of the highest ever at that time
impressed by the strength of the tournament kasparov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments
perhaps spurred on by this comment karpov played the best tournament of his life
he was undefeated and earned points out of finishing points ahead of second place kasparov and shirov
many of his wins were spectacular
this performance against the best players in the world put his elo rating tournament performance at the highest performance rating of any player in history up until when magnus carlsen won the category xxi pearl spring chess tournament with a performance of
chess statistician jeff sonas considers karpovs linares performance the best tournament result in history
karpov defended his fide title against the rising star gata kamsky in
in fide largely scrapped the old system of candidates matches instead having a large knockout event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks
in the first of these events the fide world chess championship champion karpov was seeded straight into the final defeating viswanathan anand
in the subsequent cycle the format was changed with the champion having to qualify
karpov refused to defend his title and ceased to be fide world champion after the fide world chess championship
karpovs classical tournament play has been seriously limited since since he prefers to be more involved in russian politics
he had been a member of the supreme soviet commission for foreign affairs and the president of the soviet peace fund before the soviet union dissolved
in addition he has been involved in several disputes with fide
in the september fide rating list he dropped out of the worlds top for the first time
karpov usually limits his play to exhibition events and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess
in he won a match against kasparov defeating him in a rapid time control match
in he tied for first with kasparov in a blitz tournament ahead of korchnoi and judit polgr
karpov and kasparov played a mixed game match from september in valencia spain
it consisted of four rapid and eight blitz games and took place exactly years after the two players legendary encounter at the world chess championship
kasparov won the match
karpov played a match against yasser seirawan in in st
louis missouri an important center of the north american chess scene winning
in november he won the cap dagde rapid tournament that bears his name beating vasyl ivanchuk in the final
in karpov opened his first american chess school in lindsborg kansas
on march the school announced a name change to international school of chess of the midwest due to the russian invasion of ukraine
karpov has been a member of the sixth seventh and eighth russian state dumas
since he has been a member of the public chamber of russia
he has involved himself in several humanitarian causes such as advocating the use of iodised salt
on december karpov supported the law in the russian parliament banning adoption of russian orphans by us citizens
karpov expressed support of the annexation of crimea by the russian federation and accused europe of trying to demonize putin
in august maxim dlugy said that karpov had been waiting since march for the approval of a non immigrant visa to the united states despite frequently visiting the country since
karpov had been scheduled to teach a summer camp at the chess max academy
dlugy said that karpov had been questioned at the us embassy in moscow about whether he planned to communicate with american politicians
karpov was among the russian state duma members placed under sanctions by the eu and uk during the russo ukrainian war
in march after the start of the russian invasion of ukraine the fide council suspended karpovs title of fide ambassador for life
in november karpov received a head injury that left him concussed according to some sources he was placed in an induced coma
sources vary on the cause of the injury including allegations that he was attacked while heavily intoxicated
karpovs daughter sofia claimed that he had accidentally fallen this was echoed by the russian chess federation
however he has made a full recovery since the incident
in march karpov announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of fide
the election took place in september at the th chess olympiad
in may a fundraising event took place in new york with the participation of kasparov and magnus carlsen who both supported his bid and campaigned for him
nigel short also supported karpovs candidacy
on september kirsan ilyumzhinov was reelected as president of fide votes to
karpovs boa constrictor playing style is solidly positional taking minimal risks but reacting mercilessly to the slightest error by his opponent
as a result he is often compared to jos ral capablanca the third world champion
karpov himself describes his style as followslet us say the game may be continued in two ways one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that dont yield to precise calculations the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an endgame with microscopic chances of victory
i would choose latter without thinking twice
if the opponent offers keen play i dont object but in such cases i get less satisfaction even if i win than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic
karpovs extensive stamp collection of belgian philately and belgian congo stamps and postal history covering mail from through was sold by david feldmans auction company between december and
he is also known to have large chess stamp and chess book collections
his private chess library consists of books
karpov has authored or co authored several books most of which have been translated into english
the aspect ratio of a geometric shape is the ratio of its sizes in different dimensions
for example the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side the ratio of width to height when the rectangle is oriented as a landscape
the aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by a colon less commonly as a simple or decimal fraction
the values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but rather the proportion between width and height
as an example and are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio
in objects of more than two dimensions such as hyperrectangles the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side
for a rectangle the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle
a square has the smallest possible aspect ratio of
for an ellipse the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis
an ellipse with an aspect ratio of is a circle
if the dimension d is fixed then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors
aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as xy
cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a decimal multiple of width vs unit height while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height
in digital images there is a subtle distinction between the display aspect ratio and the storage aspect ratio see distinctions
auto racing is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition
auto racing has existed since the invention of the automobile
races of various sorts were organised with the first recorded as early as
many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport but soon became an important way for automobile makers to demonstrate their machines
by the s specialist racing cars had developed
there are now numerous different categories each with different rules and regulations
the first prearranged match race of two self powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at am on august between ashton under lyne and old trafford england a distance of
it was won by the carriage of isaac watt boulton
internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline fueled automobiles
the first organized contest was on april by the chief editor of paris publication monsieur fossier
it ran from neuilly bridge to the bois de boulogne
on july the parisian magazine organized what is considered to be the worlds first motoring competition from paris to rouen
one hundred and two competitors paid a franc entrance fee
the first american automobile race is generally held to be the thanksgiving day chicago times herald race of november
press coverage of the event first aroused significant american interest in the automobile
the targa florio was an open road endurance automobile race held in the mountains of sicily italy near the islands capital of palermo
founded in it was the oldest sports car racing event part of the world sportscar championship between and
the oldest surviving sports car racing event is the hours of le mans begun in
it is run by the automobile club of the west
team ferrari won the race in
with auto construction and racing dominated by france the french automobile club acf staged a number of major international races usually from or to paris connecting with another major city in france or elsewhere in europe
aspendale racecourse in australia was the worlds first purpose built motor racing circuit opening in january
the pear shaped track was close to a mile in length with slightly banked curves and a gravel surface of crushed cement
brooklands in surrey england was the first purpose built banked motor racing venue opening in june
it featured a concrete track with high speed banked corners
one of the oldest existing purpose built automobile racing circuits in the united states still in use is the indianapolis motor speedway in speedway indiana
it is the largest capacity sports venue of any variety worldwide with a top capacity of some seated spectators
nascar was founded by bill france sr on february with the help of several other drivers of the time
the first nascar strictly stock race ever was held on june at daytona beach florida us from sports cars temporarily took a back seat to gt cars with the replacing the world championship for sports cars with the international championship for gt manufacturers
from through nascars premier series was called the winston cup series sponsored by r
reynolds tobacco company cigarette brand winston
the changes that resulted from rjrs involvement as well as the reduction of the schedule from to races a year established as the beginning of nascars modern era
the imsa gt series evolved into the american le mans series which ran its first season in
the european races eventually became the closely related european le mans series both of which mix prototypes and gts
over the last few years auto racing has seen a transformative shift echoing past pivots
the industry much like the cars it champions has had to navigate through the hairpin turns of a global pandemic and a persistent chip shortage each threatening to derail production schedules
at the same time a new course is being charted towards an electric future a dramatic change in direction thats challenging the old guard of gasoline engines
there is also a growing number of events for electric racing cars such as the formula ethe eco grand prix or the electric gt championship
in single seater racing the wheels are not covered and the cars often have aerofoil wings front and rear to produce downforce and enhance adhesion to the track
the two most popular varieties of open wheel road racing are formula one and the indycar series
in europe and asia open wheeled racing is commonly referred to as formula with appropriate hierarchical suffixes
in north america the formula terminology is not followed
the sport is usually arranged to follow an international format a regional format and or a domestic or country specific format
f is a worldwide series that runs only street circuit and race tracks
these cars are heavily based on technology and their aerodynamics
the speed record was set in by juan pablo montoya hitting km h
some of the most prominent races are the monaco grand prix the italian grand prix and the british grand prix
the season ends with the crowning of the world championship for drivers and constructors
in the united states the most popular series is the indycar series
the cars have traditionally been similar to though less technologically sophisticated than f cars with more restrictions on technology aimed at controlling costs
while these cars are not as technologically advanced they are faster mainly because they compete on oval race tracks being able to average a lap at km h
the series biggest race is the indianapolis which is commonly referred to as the greatest spectacle in racing due to being the longest continuously run race and having the largest crowd for a single day sporting event
the other major international single seater racing series is formula
regional series include super formula and formula v asia formula renault formula three formula palmer audi and formula atlantic
in the fia formula two championship brought about the revival of the f series
domestic or country specific series include formula three and formula renault with the leading introductory series being formula ford
single seater racing is not limited merely to professional teams and drivers
there exist many amateur racing clubs
in the uk the major club series are the monoposto racing club brscc f formula vee and club formula ford
each series caters to a section of the market with some primarily providing low cost racing while others aim for an authentic experience using the same regulations as the professional series
there are other categories of single seater racing including kart racing which employs a small low cost machine on small tracks
many of the current top drivers began their careers in karts
formula ford represents the most popular first open wheel category for up and coming drivers stepping up from karts
the series is still the preferred option as it has introduced an aero package and slicks allowing the junior drivers to gain experience in a race car with dynamics closer to f
the star mazda series is another entry level series
students at colleges and universities can also take part in single seater racing through the formula sae competition which involves designing and building a single seater car in a multidisciplinary team and racing it at the competition
this also develops other soft skills such as teamwork while promoting motorsport and engineering
the worlds first all female formula racing team was created in
the group was an assemblage of drivers from different racing disciplines and formed for an mtv reality pilot which was shot at mazda raceway laguna seca
in december the fia gave approval to superleague formula racing which debuted in whereby the racing teams are owned and run by prominent sports clubs such as ac milan and liverpool fc after years away from the sport former formula champion jonathan palmer reopened the f category again most drivers have graduated from the formula palmer audi series
the category is officially registered as the fia formula two championship
most rounds have two races and are support races to the fia world touring car championship
touring car racing is a style of road racing that is run with production derived four seat race cars
the lesser use of aerodynamics means following cars have a much easier time passing than in open wheel racing
it often features full contact racing with subtle bumping and nudging due to the small speed differentials and large grids
the major touring car championships conducted worldwide are the supercars championship british touring car championship deutsche tourenwagen masters world touring car championship and the world touring car cup
the european touring car cup is a one day event open to super specification touring cars from europes many national championships
the sports car club of americas speed world challenge touring car and gt championships are dominant in north america
americas historic trans am series is undergoing a period of transition but is still the longest running road racing series in the us the national auto sport association also provides a venue for amateurs to compete in home built factory derived vehicles on various local circuits
in sports car racing production derived versions of two seat sports cars also known as grand tourers and purpose built sports prototype cars compete within their respective classes on closed circuits
the premier championship series of sports car racing is the fia world endurance championship
the main series for gt car racing is the gt world challenge europe divided into two separate championships the gt world challenge europe sprint cup and the gt world challenge europe endurance cup
this series has formed after the folding of the various fia gt championships
other major gt championships include the gt world challenge america gt world challenge asia super gt and the international gt open
there are minor regional and national gt series using mainly gt and gt cars featuring both amateur and professional drivers
sports prototypes unlike gt cars do not rely on road legal cars as a base
they are closed wheel and often closed cockpit purpose built race cars intended mainly for endurance racing
they have much lower weight and more downforce compared to gt cars making them much faster
they are raced in the hours of le mans and in the le mans series asian le mans series and the weathertech sportscar championship
these cars are referred to as lmp cars with lmp being run mainly by manufacturers and the slightly less powerful lmp cars run by privateer teams
all three le mans series run gt cars in addition to le mans prototypes these cars have different restrictions than the fia gt cars
another prototype and gt racing championship exists in the united states the grand am which began in sanctions its own endurance series the rolex sports car series which consists of slower and lower cost race cars compared to lmp and fia gt cars
the rolex sports car series and american le mans series announced a merger between the two series forming the weathertech sportscar championship starting in
these races are often conducted over long distances at least and cars are driven by teams of two or more drivers switching every few hours
due to the performance difference between production based sports cars and purpose built sports prototypes one race usually involves several racing classes each fighting for its own championship
famous sports car races include the hours of le mans the rolex at daytona hours of spa franchorchamps the hours of sebring the hours of watkins glen and the petit le mans at road atlanta
there is also the hours of the nrburgring on the infamous nordschleife track and the dubai hour which is aimed at gt and below cars with a mixture of professional and pro am drivers
production car racing otherwise known as showroom stock in the us is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing mainly used to restrict costs
numerous production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars
most series with a few exceptions follow the group n regulation
there are several different series that are run all over the world most notably japans super taikyu and imsas firehawk series which ran in the s and s all over the united states
in north america stock car racing is the most popular form of auto racing
primarily raced on oval tracks stock cars vaguely resemble production cars but are in fact purpose built racing machines that are built to tight specifications and together with touring cars also called silhouette racing cars
the largest stock car racing governing body is nascar
nascars premier series is the nascar cup series its most famous races being the daytona the southern the coca cola and the brickyard
nascar also runs several feeder series including the xfinity series and gander rv outdoors truck series
the series conduct races across the entire continental united states
the nascar pintys series conducts races across canada and the nascar peak mexico series conducts races across mexico
nascar also governs several smaller regional series such as the whelen modified tour
modified cars are best described as open wheel cars
modified cars have no parts related to the stock vehicle for which they are named after
a number of modified cars display a manufacturers logo and vehicle name yet use components produced by another automobile manufacturer
there are also other stock car governing bodies most notably the automobile racing club of america
in the uk british stock car racing is also referred to as short circuit racing
uk stock car racing started in the s and grew rapidly through the s and s
events take place on shale or tarmac tracks usually around mile long
there are around tracks in the uk and upwards of active drivers
the sport is split into three basic divisions distinguished by the rules regarding car contact during racing
the most famous championship are the brisca f stock cars
full contact formulas include bangers bombers and rookie bangers and racing features demolition derbies figure of eight and oval racing
semi contact formulas include brisca f f and superstox where bumpers are used tactically
non contact formulas include national hot rods stock rods and lightning rods
one make or single marque championships often employ production based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturers range
there are numerous notable one make formulae from various countries and regions some of which such as the porsche supercup and previously iroc have fostered many distinct national championships
single marque series are often found at the club level to which the production based cars limited modifications and close parity in performance are very well suited
some of the better known single make series are the mini championship the radical european masters john cooper mini challenge clio cup ginettas caterhams bmws and mxs
there are also single chassis single seater formulae such as formula renault and formula bmw usually as feeder series for senior race formula
rallying is typically distinguished from other forms of motorsport by not running directly against other competitors over laps of a circuit but instead in a point to point format in which participants leave at regular intervals from one or more start points
cars compete on closed public roads or off road areas on a point to point format where participants and their co drivers rally to a set of points leaving in regular intervals from start points
a rally is typically conducted over a number of special stages on any terrain which entrants are often allowed to scout beforehand at reduced speeds compiling detailed shorthand descriptions of the track or road as they go
these detailed descriptions are known as pace notes
during the actual rally the co driver reads the pace notes aloud to the driver enabling them to complete each stage as quickly as possible
competition is based on the lowest total elapsed time over the course of an events special stages including penalties
rallying at international and most national championship levels involves two classes of homologated road legal production based cars group n production cars and more modified group a cars
the top series is the world rally championship first contested in but there are also regional championships and many countries have their own national championships
some famous rallies include the monte carlo rally rally argentina rally finland and rally gb
another famous event is the paris dakar rally conceived in
there are also many smaller club level categories of rallies which are popular with amateurs making up the grass roots of motor sports
cars at this level may not comply fully with the requirements of group a or group n homologation
other major rally events include the british rally championship intercontinental rally challenge african rally championship asia pacific rally championship and endurance rally events like the dakar rally
the targa tasmania held on the australian island state of tasmania and run annually since takes its name from the targa florio a former motoring event held on the island of sicily
the competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the mille miglia the coupe des alpes and the tour de corse
similarly named events around the world include the targa newfoundland based in canada targa west based in western australia targa new zealand and other smaller events
time attack events began in japan in the mid s
they have since spread around the world
time attack racing is a type of motorsport in which the racers compete for the best lap time
each vehicle is timed through numerous circuits of the track
the racers make a preliminary circuit then run the timed laps and then finish with a cool down lap
time attack and time trial events differ by competition format and rules
time attack has a limited number of laps time trial has open sessions
unlike other timed motorsport disciplines such as sprinting and hillclimbing the car is required to start off under full rolling start conditions following a warm up lap in which they will have to accelerate out as fast as possible to determine how fast they enter their timed lap
commonly as the cars are modified road going cars they are required to have tires authorized for road use
in drag racing the objective is to complete a given straight line distance from a standing start ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane
this distance is traditionally though has become popular since the s
the vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time depending on the class of racing
vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose built dragster
speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class
average street cars cover the mile in to seconds whereas a top fuel dragster takes seconds or less reaching speeds of up to
drag racing was organized as a sport by wally parks in the early s through the national hot rod association
the nhra was formed to discourage street racing
when launching a top fuel dragster will accelerate at g and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is g more than the space shuttle experiences
a top fuel car can be heard over away and can generate a reading from to on the richter scale
drag racing is two cars head to head the winner proceeding to the next round
professional classes are all first to the finish line wins
sportsman racing is handicapped using an index and cars running under their index break out and lose
the slowest cars bracket racers are also handicapped but rather than an index they use a dial in
in off road racing various classes of specially modified vehicles including cars compete in races through off road environments
in north america these races often take place in the desert such as the famous baja
another format for off road racing happens on closed course short course tracks such as crandon international off road raceway
in the s and s the short course was extended to racing inside stadiums in the mickey thompson entertainment group this format was revived by robby gordon in with his stadium super trucks series
in europe offroad refers to events such as autocross or rallycross while desert races and rally raids such as the paris dakar master rallye or european bajas are called cross country rallies
the modern kart was invented by art ingels a fabricator at the indianapolis car manufacturer kurtis kraft in southern california in
ingels took a small chainsaw engine and mounted it to a simple tube frame chassis weighing less than lb
ingels and everyone else who drove the kart were startled at its performance capabilities
the sport soon blossomed in southern california and quickly spread around the world
although often seen as the entry point for serious racers into the sport kart racing or karting can be an economical way for amateurs to try racing and is also a fully fledged international sport in its own right
a large proportion of professional racing drivers began in karts often from a very young age such as michael schumacher and fernando alonso
several former motorcycle champions have also taken up the sport notably wayne rainey who was paralysed in a racing accident and now races a hand controlled kart
as one of the cheapest ways to race karting is seeing its popularity grow worldwide
despite their diminutive size karts of the most powerful class superkart and a power output of hp can have a power to weight ratio of hp tonne
without the driver this figure doubles to almost hp tonne
historic motorsport or vintage motorsport uses vehicles limited to a particular era
only safety precautions are modernized in these hobbyist races
a historical event can be of various types of motorsport disciplines from road racing to rallying
because it is based on a particular era it is more hobbyist oriented reducing corporate sponsorship
the only modern equipment used is related to safety and timing
a historical event can be of a number of different motorsport disciplines
some of the most famous events include the goodwood festival of speed and goodwood revival in britain and monterey historic in the united states
championships range from grass root austin seven racing to the fia thoroughbred grand prix championship for classic formula one chassis
while there are several professional teams and drivers in historical racing this branch of auto sport tends to be contested by wealthy car owners and is thus more amateur and less competitive in its approach
in many types of auto races particularly those held on closed courses flags are displayed to indicate the general status of the track and to communicate instructions to competitors
while individual series have different rules and the flags have changed from the first years these are generally accepted
the worst accident in racing history is the le mans disaster where more than people died including the french driver pierre levegh
in auto racing the racing setup or car setup is the set of adjustments made to the vehicle to optimize its behaviour
adjustments can occur in suspensions brakes transmissions engines tires and many others
aerodynamics and airflow play big roles in the setup of a race car
aerodynamic downforce improves the race cars handling by lowering the center of gravity and distributing the weight of the car equally on each tire
once this is achieved fuel consumption decreases and the forces against the car are significantly lowered
many aerodynamic experiments are conducted in wind tunnels to simulate real life situations while measuring the various drag forces on the car
these rolling roads produce many wind situations and direct air flow at certain speeds and angles
when a diffuser is installed under the car the amount of drag force is significantly lowered and the overall aerodynamics of the vehicle is positively adjusted
wings and canards channel the airflow in the most efficient way to get the least amount of drag from the car
it is experimentally proven that downforce is gained and the vehicles handling is considerably changed when aerodynamic wings on the front and rear of the vehicle are installed
suspension plays a huge part in giving the race car the ability to be driven optimally
shocks are mounted vertically or horizontally to prevent the body from rolling in the corners
the suspension is important because it makes the car stable and easier to control and keeps the tires on the road when driving on uneven terrain
it works in three different ways including vertically longitudinally and laterally to control movement when racing on various tracks
tyres called r compounds are commonly used in motorsports for high amounts of traction
the soft rubber allows them to expand when they are heated up making more surface area on the pavement therefore producing the most traction
these types of tyres do not have grooves on them
tyre pressure is dependent on the temperature of the tyre and track when racing
each time a driver pulls into the pits the tyre pressure and temperature should be tested for optimal performance
when the tyres get too hot they will swell or inflate and need to be deflated to the correct pressure
when the tyres are not warmed up they will not perform as well
brakes on a race car are imperative in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced how many laps are being run track conditions due to weather and how many caution runs require more braking
there are three variables to consider in racing brake pedal displacement brake pedal force and vehicle deceleration
various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness sensitivity and pedal force of the brakes
when using the brakes effectively the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase
these phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure
brake performance is measured in bite and consistency
bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes and they have not warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently
consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking
these two measurements determine the wear of the brakes
the race cars engine needs a considerable amount of air to produce maximum power
the air intake manifold sucks the air from scoops on the hood and front bumper and feeds it into the engine
many engine modifications to increase horsepower and efficiency are commonly used in many racing sanctioning bodies
engines are tuned on a machine called a dynamometer which is commonly known in the racing world as a dyno
the car is driven onto the dyno and many gauges and sensors are hooked up to the car that are controlled by an online program to test force torque or power
through the testing the cars engine maps can be changed to get the most horsepower and ultimately speed out of the vehicle
racing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by the team or by sponsors and can command very substantial salaries
contrary to what may be popularly assumed racing drivers as a group do not have unusually better reflexes or peripheral response time
during repeated physiological evaluations of professional racing drivers the two characteristics that stand out are racers near obsessive need to control their surroundings and an unusual ability to process fast moving information
in this researchers have noted a strong correlation between racers psychological profiles and those of fighter pilots
in tests comparing racers to members of the general public the greater the complexity of the information processing matrix the greater the speed gap between racers and the public
due partly to the performance capabilities of modern racing cars racing drivers require a high level of fitness focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment
racing drivers mainly complain about pains in the lumbar shoulder and neck regions
racing drivers experience extremely large g forces because formula cars and sports prototypes generate more downforce and are able to corner at significantly higher speeds
formula drivers routinely experience g loadings in excess of g
anarcho capitalism is an anti statist libertarian political philosophy and economic theory that seeks to abolish centralized states in favor of stateless societies with systems of private property enforced by private agencies the non aggression principle free markets and self ownership which extends the concept to include control of private property as part of the self
in the absence of statute anarcho capitalists hold that society tends to contractually self regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a voluntary society involving the voluntary exchange of goods and services
in a theoretical anarcho capitalist society the system of private property would still exist and be enforced by private defense agencies and or insurance companies selected by customers which would operate competitively in a market and fulfill the roles of courts and the police
according to its proponents various historical theorists have espoused philosophies similar to anarcho capitalism but the first person to use the term anarcho capitalism was murray rothbard in the s
rothbard a leading figure in the th century american libertarian movement synthesized elements from the austrian school classical liberalism and th century american individualist anarchists and mutualists lysander spooner and benjamin tucker while rejecting the labor theory of value
rothbards anarcho capitalist society would operate under a mutually agreed upon legal code which would be generally accepted and which the courts would pledge themselves to follow
this legal code would recognize contracts between individuals private property self ownership and tort law in keeping with the non aggression principle
rothbard views the power of the state as unjustified arguing that it restricts individual rights and prosperity and creates social and economic problems
anarcho capitalists and right libertarians cite several historical precedents of what they believe to be examples of quasi anarcho capitalism including the republic of cospaia acadia anglo saxon england medieval iceland the american old west gaelic ireland and law merchant admiralty law and early common law
anarcho capitalism is distinguished from minarchism which advocates a night watchman state limited to protecting individuals from aggression and enforcing private property
anarcho capitalism is also distinguished from social anarchism a branch of anarchism that sees individual freedom as interrelated with mutual aid
unlike most anarchists anarcho capitalists support private property and private institutions
anarcho capitalism developed from radical american anti state libertarianism and individualist anarchism
a strong current within anarchism does not consider anarcho capitalism to be part of the anarchist movement because they argue that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms
according to several scholars anarcho capitalism lies outside the tradition of the vast majority of anarchist schools of thought and is more closely affiliated with capitalism right libertarianism and classical liberalism
social anarchists oppose and reject capitalism and consider anarcho capitalism to be a contradiction in terms although some including anarcho capitalists and right libertarians consider anarcho capitalism to be a form of anarchism
according to the encyclopdia britannicaanarcho capitalism is usually seen as part of the new right
author j michael oliver says that during the s a philosophical movement arose in the united states that championed reason ethical egoism and free market capitalism
according to oliver anarcho capitalism is a political theory which logically follows the philosophical conclusions of objectivism a philosophical system developed by russian american writer ayn rand but oliver acknowledges that his advocacy of anarcho capitalism is quite at odds with rands ardent defense of limited government
professor lisa duggan also says that rands anti statist pro free market stances went on to shape the politics of anarcho capitalism
according to patrik schumacher the political ideology and programme of anarcho capitalism envisages the radicalization of the neoliberal rollback of the state and calls for the extension of entrepreneurial freedom and competitive market rationality to the point where the scope for private enterprise is all encompassing and leaves no space for state action whatsoever
anarcho capitalists opposition to the state is reflected in their goal of keeping but privatizing all functions of the state
they see capitalism and the free market as the basis for a free and prosperous society
murray rothbard who is credited with coining the term anarcho capitalism stated that the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism is the difference between peaceful voluntary exchange and a collusive partnership between business and government that uses coercion to subvert the free market
rothbard argued that all government services including defense are inefficient because they lack a market based pricing mechanism regulated by the voluntary decisions of consumers purchasing services that fulfill their highest priority needs and by investors seeking the most profitable enterprises to invest in
furthermore linda and morris tannehill believe that no coercive monopoly of force can arise on a truly free market and that a governments citizenry can not desert them in favor of a competent protection and defense agency
maverick edwards of the liberty university describes anarcho capitalism as a political social and economic theory that places markets as the central governing body and where government no longer grants rights to its citizenry
writer stanisaw wjtowicz says that although anarcho capitalists are against centralized states they hold that all people would naturally share and agree to a specific moral theory based on the non aggression principle
while the friedmanian formulation of anarcho capitalism is robust to the presence of violence and in fact assumes some degree of violence will occur anarcho capitalism as formulated by rothbard and others holds strongly to the central libertarian nonaggression axiom sometimes non aggression principle
rothbard wrote rothbards defense of the self ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives namely that either a group of people can own another group of people or that no single person has full ownership over ones self
rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic ie a just natural law that can govern all people independent of place and time
the only alternative that remains to rothbard is self ownership which he believes is both axiomatic and universal
in general the non aggression axiom is described by rothbard as a prohibition against the initiation of force or the threat of force against persons or property
the initiation of force is usually referred to as aggression or coercion
the difference between anarcho capitalists and other libertarians is largely one of the degree to which they take this axiom
minarchist libertarians such as libertarian political parties would retain the state in some smaller and less invasive form retaining at the very least public police courts and military
however others might give further allowance for other government programs
in contrast rothbard rejects any level of state intervention defining the state as a coercive monopoly and as the only entity in human society excluding acknowledged criminals that derives its income entirely from coercion in the form of taxation which rothbard describes as compulsory seizure of the property of the states inhabitants or subjects
some anarcho capitalists such as rothbard accept the non aggression axiom on an intrinsic moral or natural law basis
it is in terms of the non aggression principle that rothbard defined his interpretation of anarchism a system which provides no legal sanction for such aggression against person and property and wrote that what anarchism proposes to do then is to abolish the state ie to abolish the regularized institution of aggressive coercion
in an interview published in the american libertarian journal the new banner rothbard stated that capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism
anarcho capitalists postulate the privatization of everything including cities with all their infrastructures public spaces streets and urban management systems
central to rothbardian anarcho capitalism are the concepts of self ownership and original appropriation that combines personal and private property
hans hermann hoppe wrote rothbard however rejected the lockean proviso and followed the rule of first come first served without any consideration of how much resources are left for other individuals which opposed john lockes beliefs
anarcho capitalists advocate private ownership of the means of production and the allocation of the product of labor created by workers within the context of wage labour and the free market that is through decisions made by property and capital owners regardless of what an individual needs or does not need
original appropriation allows an individual to claim any never before used resources including land and by improving or otherwise using it own it with the same absolute right as their own body and retaining those rights forever regardless of whether the resource is still being used by them
according to rothbard property can only come about through labor therefore original appropriation of land is not legitimate by merely claiming it or building a fence around it it is only by using land and by mixing ones labor with it that original appropriation is legitimized any attempt to claim a new resource that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be
rothbard argued that the resource need not continue to be used in order for it to be the persons property as for once his labor is mixed with the natural resource it remains his owned land
his labor has been irretrievably mixed with the land and the land is therefore his or his assigns in perpetuity
in justice and property right rothbard wrote that any identifiable owner must be accorded his property
in the case of slavery rothbard claimed that in many cases the old plantations and the heirs and descendants of the former slaves can be identified and the reparations can become highly specific indeed
rothbard believed slaves rightfully own any land they were forced to work on under the homestead principle
if property is held by the state rothbard advocated its confiscation and return to the private sector writing that any property in the hands of the state is in the hands of thieves and should be liberated as quickly as possible
rothbard proposed that state universities be seized by the students and faculty under the homestead principle
rothbard also supported the expropriation of nominally private property if it is the result of state initiated force such as businesses that receive grants and subsidies
rothbard further proposed that businesses who receive at least of their funding from the state be confiscated by the workers writing what we libertarians object to then is not government per se but crime what we object to is unjust or criminal property titles what we are for is not private property per se but just innocent non criminal private property
similarly karl hess wrote that libertarianism wants to advance principles of property but that it in no way wishes to defend willy nilly all property which now is called private
much of that property is stolen
much is of dubious title
all of it is deeply intertwined with an immoral coercive state system
by accepting an axiomatic definition of private property and property rights anarcho capitalists deny the legitimacy of a state on principle
hans hermann hoppe argues anarchists view capitalism as an inherently authoritarian and hierarchical system and seek the abolishment of private property
there is disagreement between anarchists and anarcho capitalists as the former generally rejects anarcho capitalism as a form of anarchism and considers anarcho capitalism a contradiction in terms while the latter holds that the abolishment of private property would require expropriation which is counterproductive to order and would require a state
as opposed to anarchists most anarcho capitalists reject the commons
however some of them propose that non state public or community property can also exist in an anarcho capitalist society
for anarcho capitalists what is important is that it is acquired and transferred without help or hindrance from what they call the compulsory state
deontological anarcho capitalists believe that the only just and most economically beneficial way to acquire property is through voluntary trade gift or labor based original appropriation rather than through aggression or fraud
anarcho capitalists state that there could be cases where common property may develop in a lockean natural rights framework
anarcho capitalists make the example of a number of private businesses which may arise in an area each owning the land and buildings that they use but they argue that the paths between them become cleared and trodden incrementally through customer and commercial movement
these thoroughfares may become valuable to the community but according to them ownership cannot be attributed to any single person and original appropriation does not apply because many contributed the labor necessary to create them
in order to prevent it from falling to the tragedy of the commons anarcho capitalists suggest transitioning from common to private property wherein an individual would make a homesteading claim based on disuse acquire title by the assent of the community consensus form a corporation with other involved parties or other means
randall g
holcombe see challenges stemming from the idea of common property under anarcho capitalism such as whether an individual might claim fishing rights in the area of a major shipping lane and thereby forbid passage through it
in contrast hoppes work on anarcho capitalist theory is based on the assumption that all property is privately held including all streets rivers airports and harbors which forms the foundation of his views on immigration
some anarcho capitalists strongly oppose intellectual property
stephan n
kinsella argues that ownership only relates to tangible assets
the society envisioned by anarcho capitalists has been labelled by them as a contractual society which rothbard described as a society based purely on voluntary action entirely unhampered by violence or threats of violence the system relies on contracts between individuals as the legal framework which would be enforced by private police and security forces as well as private arbitrations
rothbard argues that limited liability for corporations could also exist through contract arguing that orporations are not at all monopolistic privileges they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital
on the purely free market those men would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation
however corporations created in this way would not be able to replicate the limit on liabilities arising non contractually such as liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury which corporations currently enjoy
rothbard acknowledges that limited liability for torts is the illegitimate conferring of a special privilege
there are limits to the right to contract under some interpretations of anarcho capitalism
rothbard believes that the right to contract is based in inalienable rights and because of this any contract that implicitly violates those rights can be voided at will preventing a person from permanently selling himself or herself into unindentured slavery
however rothbard justifies the practice of child selling
other interpretations conclude that banning such contracts would in itself be an unacceptably invasive interference in the right to contract
included in the right of contract is the right to contract oneself out for employment by others
while anarchists criticize wage labour describing it as wage slavery anarcho capitalists view it as a consensual contract
some anarcho capitalists prefer to see self employment prevail over wage labor
david d
friedman has expressed a preference for a society where almost everyone is self employed and instead of corporations there are large groups of entrepreneurs related by trade not authority
each sells not his time but what his time produces
different anarcho capitalists propose different forms of anarcho capitalism and one area of disagreement is in the area of law
in the market for liberty morris and linda tannehill object to any statutory law whatsoever
they argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another in order to decide if an act is right or wrong
however while also supporting a on force and fraud rothbard supports the establishment of a mutually agreed upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow as he presumes a high degree of convergence amongst individuals about what constitutes natural justice
unlike both the tannehills and rothbard who see an ideological commonality of ethics and morality as a requirement david d
friedman proposes that the systems of law will be produced for profit on the open market just as books and bras are produced today
there could be competition among different brands of law just as there is competition among different brands of cars
friedman says whether this would lead to a libertarian society remains to be proven
he says it is a possibility that very un libertarian laws may result such as laws against drugs but he thinks this would be rare
he reasons that if the value of a law to its supporters is less than its cost to its victims that law
will not survive in an anarcho capitalist society
anarcho capitalists only accept the collective defense of individual liberty insofar as such groups are formed and paid for on an explicitly voluntary basis
however their complaint is not just that the states defensive services are funded by taxation but that the state assumes it is the only legitimate practitioner of physical force that is they believe it forcibly prevents the private sector from providing comprehensive security such as a police judicial and prison systems to protect individuals from aggressors
anarcho capitalists believe that there is nothing morally superior about the state which would grant it but not private individuals a right to use physical force to restrain aggressors
if competition in security provision were allowed to exist prices would also be lower and services would be better according to anarcho capitalists
according to molinari under a regime of liberty the natural organization of the security industry would not be different from that of other industries
proponents believe that private systems of justice and defense already exist naturally forming where the market is allowed to compensate for the failure of the state namely private arbitration security guards neighborhood watch groups and so on
these private courts and police are sometimes referred to generically as private defense agencies
the defense of those unable to pay for such protection might be financed by charitable organizations relying on voluntary donation rather than by state institutions relying on taxation or by cooperative self help by groups of individuals
edward stringham argues that private adjudication of disputes could enable the market to internalize externalities and provide services that customers desire
in the context of revolution rothbard stated that the american revolutionary war was the only war involving the united states that could be justified
some anarcho capitalists such as rothbard feel that violent revolution is counter productive and prefer voluntary forms of economic secession to the extent possible
retributive justice is often a component of the contracts imagined for an anarcho capitalist society
according to matthew okeefee some anarcho capitalists believe prisons or indentured servitude would be justifiable institutions to deal with those who violate anarcho capitalist property relations while others believe exile or forced restitution are sufficient
bruce l
benson argues that legal codes may impose punitive damages for intentional torts in the interest of deterring crime
benson gives the example of a thief who breaks into a house by picking a lock
even if caught before taking anything benson argues that the thief would still owe the victim for violating the sanctity of his property rights
benson opines that despite the lack of objectively measurable losses in such cases standardized rules that are generally perceived to be fair by members of the community would in all likelihood be established through precedent allowing judgments to specify payments that are reasonably appropriate for most criminal offenses
morris and linda tannehill raise a similar example saying that a bank robber who had an attack of conscience and returned the money would still owe reparations for endangering the employees and customers lives and safety in addition to the costs of the defense agency answering the tellers call for help
however they believe that the robbers loss of reputation would be even more damaging
they suggest that specialized companies would list aggressors so that anyone wishing to do business with a man could first check his record provided they trust the veracity of the companies records
they further theorise that the bank robber would find insurance companies listing him as a very poor risk and other firms would be reluctant to enter into contracts with him
murray rothbard has listed different ideologies of which his interpretations he said have influenced anarcho capitalism
this includes his interpretation of anarchism and more precisely individualist anarchism classical liberalism and the austrian school of economic thought
scholars additionally associate anarcho capitalism with neo classical liberalism radical neoliberalism and right libertarianism
in both its social and individualist forms anarchism is usually considered an anti capitalist and radical left wing or far left movement that promotes libertarian socialist economic theories such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism
because anarchism is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement and as having a historical association with anti capitalism and socialism anarchists believe that capitalism is incompatible with social and economic equality and therefore do not recognize anarcho capitalism as an anarchist school of thought
in particular anarchists argue that capitalist transactions are not voluntary and that maintaining the class structure of a capitalist society requires coercion which is incompatible with an anarchist society
the usage of libertarian is also in dispute
while both anarchists and anarcho capitalists have used it libertarian was synonymous with anarchist until the mid th century when anarcho capitalist theory developed
anarcho capitalists are distinguished from the dominant anarchist tradition by their relation to property and capital
while both anarchism and anarcho capitalism share general antipathy towards government authority anarcho capitalism favors free market capitalism
anarchists including egoists such as max stirner have supported the protection of an individuals freedom from powers of both government and private property owners
in contrast while condemning governmental encroachment on personal liberties anarcho capitalists support freedoms based on private property rights
anarcho capitalist theorist murray rothbard argued that protesters should rent a street for protest from its owners
the abolition of public amenities is a common theme in some anarcho capitalist writings
as anarcho capitalism puts laissez faire economics before economic equality it is commonly viewed as incompatible with the anti capitalist and egalitarian tradition of anarchism
although anarcho capitalist theory implies the abolition of the state in favour of a fully laissez faire economy it lies outside the tradition of anarchism
while using the language of anarchism anarcho capitalism only shares anarchisms antipathy towards the state and not anarchisms antipathy towards hierarchy as theorists expect from anarcho capitalist economic power relations
it follows a different paradigm from anarchism and has a fundamentally different approach and goals
in spite of the anarcho in its title anarcho capitalism is more closely affiliated with capitalism right libertarianism and liberalism than with anarchism
some within this laissez faire tradition reject the designation of anarcho capitalism believing that capitalism may either refer to the laissez faire market they support or the government regulated system that they oppose
rothbard argued that anarcho capitalism is the only true form of anarchism the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he maintained that any other form presupposes authoritarian enforcement of a political ideology such as redistribution of private property which he attributed to anarchism
according to this argument the capitalist free market is the natural situation that would result from people being free from state authority and entails the establishment of all voluntary associations in society such as cooperatives non profit organizations businesses and so on
moreover anarcho capitalists as well as classical liberal minarchists argue that the application of anarchist ideals as advocated by what they term left wing anarchists would require an authoritarian body of some sort to impose it
based on their understanding and interpretation of anarchism in order to forcefully prevent people from accumulating capital which they believe is a goal of anarchists there would necessarily be a redistributive organization of some sort which would have the authority to in essence exact a tax and re allocate the resulting resources to a larger group of people
they conclude that this theoretical body would inherently have political power and would be nothing short of a state
the difference between such an arrangement and an anarcho capitalist system is what anarcho capitalists see as the voluntary nature of organization within anarcho capitalism contrasted with a centralized ideology and a paired enforcement mechanism which they believe would be necessary under what they describe as a coercively egalitarian anarchist system
rothbard also argued that the capitalist system of today is not properly anarchistic because it often colludes with the state
according to rothbard what marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term
these two contradictory concepts are what i would call free market capitalism on the one hand and state capitalism on the other
the difference between free market capitalism and state capitalism writes rothbard is precisely the difference between on the one hand peaceful voluntary exchange and on the other violent expropriation
he continues state capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble
traditional anarchists reject the notion of capitalism hierarchies and private property
albert meltzer argued that anarcho capitalism simply cannot be anarchism because capitalism and the state are inextricably interlinked and because capitalism exhibits domineering hierarchical structures such as that between an employer and an employee
anna morgenstern approaches this topic from the opposite perspective arguing that anarcho capitalists are not really capitalists because mass concentration of capital is impossible without the state
according to jeremy jennings t is hard not to conclude that these ideas referring to anarcho capitalism argued to have roots deep in classical liberalism more so than in anarchism are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is
for jennings anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual but as we have already seen for the extension of individuality and community
similarly barbara goodwin emeritus professor of politics at the university of east anglia norwich argues that anarcho capitalisms true place is in the group of right wing libertarians not in anarchism
some right libertarian scholars like michael huemer who identify with the ideology describe anarcho capitalism as a variety of anarchism
british author andrew heywood also believes that individualist anarchism overlaps with libertarianism and is usually linked to a strong belief in the market as a self regulating mechanism most obviously manifest in the form of anarcho capitalism
frank h
brooks author of the individualist anarchists an anthology of liberty believes that anarchism has always included a significant strain of radical individualism from the hyperrationalism of godwin to the egoism of stirner to the libertarians and anarcho capitalists of today
while both anarchism and anarcho capitalism are in opposition to the state it is a necessary but not sufficient condition because anarchists and anarcho capitalists interpret state rejection differently
austrian school economist david prychitko in the context of anarcho capitalism says that while society without a state is necessary for full fledged anarchy it is nevertheless insufficient
according to ruth kinna anarcho capitalists are anti statists who draw more on right wing liberal theory and the austrian school than anarchist traditions
kinna writes that n order to highlight the clear distinction between the two positions anarchists describe anarcho capitalists as propertarians
anarcho capitalism is usually seen as part of the new right
some anarcho capitalists argue that according to them anarchists consider the word anarchy as to be the antithesis of hierarchy and therefore that anarcho capitalism is sometimes considered to be a term with differences philosophically to what they personally consider to be true anarchism as an anarcho capitalist society would inherently contain hierarchy
additionally rothbard discusses the difference between government and governance thus proponents of anarcho capitalism think the philosophys common name is indeed consistent as it promotes private governance but is vehemently anti government
historian and libertarian ralph raico argued that what liberal philosophers had come up with was a form of individualist anarchism or as it would be called today anarcho capitalism or market anarchism
he also said that gustave de molinari was proposing a doctrine of the private production of security a position which was later taken up by murray rothbard
some anarcho capitalists consider molinari to be the first proponent of anarcho capitalism
in the preface to the english translation by murray rothbard called the production of security the first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho capitalism although admitting that molinari did not use the terminology and probably would have balked at the name
hans hermann hoppe said that the article the production of security is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho capitalism
according to hans hermann hoppe one of the th century precursors of anarcho capitalism were philosopher herbert spencer classical liberal auberon herbert and liberal socialist franz oppenheimer
ruth kinna writes that anarcho capitalism is a term coined by murray rothbard to describe a commitment to unregulated private property and laissez faire economics prioritizing the liberty rights of individuals unfettered by government regulation to accumulate consume and determine the patterns of their lives as they see fit
according to kinna anarcho capitalists will sometimes label themselves market anarchists because they recognize the negative connotations of capitalism
but the literature of anarcho capitalism draws on classical liberal theory particularly the austrian school friedrich von hayek and ludwig von mises rather than recognizable anarchist traditions
ayn rands laissez faire anti government corporate philosophy objectivism is sometimes associated with anarcho capitalism
other scholars similarly associate anarcho capitalism with anti state classical liberalism neo classical liberalism radical neoliberalism and right libertarianism
paul dragos aligica writes that there is a foundational difference between the classical liberal and the anarcho capitalist positions
classical liberalism while accepting critical arguments against collectivism acknowledges a certain level of public ownership and collective governance as necessary to provide practical solutions to political problems
in contrast anarcho capitalism according to aligica denies any requirement for any form of public administration and allows no meaningful role for the public sphere which is seen as sub optimal and illegitimate
murray rothbard a student of ludwig von mises stated that he was influenced by the work of the th century american individualist anarchists
in the winter of rothbard decided to reject minimal state laissez faire and embrace his interpretation of individualist anarchism
in rothbard wrote that lysander spooner and benjamin r
tucker were unsurpassed as political philosophers and nothing is more needed today than a revival and development of the largely forgotten legacy they left to political philosophy
however rothbard thought that they had a faulty understanding of economics as the th century individualist anarchists had a labor theory of value as influenced by the classical economists while rothbard was a student of austrian school economics which does not agree with the labor theory of value
rothbard sought to meld th century american individualist anarchists advocacy of economic individualism and free markets with the principles of austrian school economics arguing that is in the body of thought known as austrian economics a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social weltanschauung
rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected
tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it
peter marshall states that anarcho capitalism overlooks the egalitarian implications of traditional individualist anarchists like spooner and tucker
stephanie silberstein states that while spooner was no free market capitalist nor an anarcho capitalist he was not as opposed to capitalism as most socialists were
in the spooner tucker doctrine an economists view rothbard explained his disagreements
rothbard disagreed with tucker that it would cause the money supply to increase because he believed that the money supply in a free market would be self regulating
if it were not then rothbard argued inflation would occur so it is not necessarily desirable to increase the money supply in the first place
rothbard claimed that tucker was wrong to think that interest would disappear regardless because he believed people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation so there is no reason why this would change just because banking was unregulated
tucker held a labor theory of value and thought that in a free market people would be paid in proportion to how much labor they exerted and that exploitation or usury was taking place if they were not
as tucker explained in state socialism and anarchism his theory was that unregulated banking would cause more money to be available and that this would allow the proliferation of new businesses which would in turn raise demand for labor
this led tucker to believe that the labor theory of value would be vindicated and equal amounts of labor would receive equal pay
as an austrian school economist rothbard did not agree with the labor theory and believed that prices of goods and services are proportional to marginal utility rather than to labor amounts in the free market
as opposed to tucker he did not think that there was anything exploitative about people receiving an income according to how much buyers of their services value their labor or what that labor produces
without the labor theory of value some argue that th century individualist anarchists approximate the modern movement of anarcho capitalism although this has been contested or rejected
as economic theory changed the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neoclassical economics and rothbard combined mises austrian school of economics with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist american anarchists of the th century such as tucker and spooner
in the mid s rothbard wrote an unpublished article named are libertarians anarchists under the pseudonym aubrey herbert concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of anarchists including the individualist anarchists of the th century concluding that we are not anarchists and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground and are being completely unhistorical
on the other hand it is clear that we are not archists either we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive
perhaps then we could call ourselves by a new name nonarchist
joe peacott an american individualist anarchist in the mutualist tradition criticizes anarcho capitalists for trying to hegemonize the individualist anarchism label and make appear as if all individualist anarchists are in favor of capitalism
peacott states that individualists both past and present agree with the communist anarchists that present day capitalism is based on economic coercion not on voluntary contract
rent and interest are the mainstays of modern capitalism and are protected and enforced by the state
without these two unjust institutions capitalism could not exist
anarchist activists and scholars do not consider anarcho capitalism as a part of the anarchist movement arguing that anarchism has historically been an anti capitalist movement and see it as incompatible with capitalist forms
although some regard anarcho capitalism as a form of individualist anarchism many others disagree or contest the existence of an individualist socialist divide
in coming to terms that anarchists mostly identified with socialism rothbard wrote that individualist anarchism is different from anarcho capitalism and other capitalist theories due to the individualist anarchists retaining the labor theory of value and socialist doctrines
similarly many writers deny that anarcho capitalism is a form of anarchism or that capitalism is compatible with anarchism
the palgrave handbook of anarchism writes that benjamin franks rightly points out individualisms that defend or reinforce hierarchical forms such as the economic power relations of anarcho capitalism are incompatible with practices of social anarchism based on developing immanent goods which contest such as inequalities
laurence davis cautiously asks a jew ceased to be a jew upon baptism
from the perspective of racial antisemitism however the assimilated jew was still a jew even after baptism
from the enlightenment onward it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards jews
once jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance without leaving behind the old christian hostility towards jews the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable even before explicitly racist doctrines appear
some christians such as the catholic priest ernest jouin who published the first french translation of the protocols combined religious and racial antisemitism as in his statement that from the triple viewpoint of race of nationality and of religion the jew has become the enemy of humanity
the virulent antisemitism of douard drumont one of the most widely read catholic writers in france during the dreyfus affair likewise combined religious and racial antisemitism
drumont founded the antisemitic league of france
the underlying premise of economic antisemitism is that jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by jews
linking jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting antisemitic canards
antisemites claim that jews control the world finances a theory promoted in the fraudulent protocols of the elders of zion and later repeated by henry ford and his dearborn independent
in the modern era such myths continue to be spread in books such as the secret relationship between blacks and jews published by the nation of islam and on the internet
gerald krefetz summarizes the myth as control the banks the money supply the economy and businesses of the community of the country of the world
krefetz gives as illustrations many slurs and proverbs which suggest that jews are stingy or greedy or miserly or aggressive bargainers
during the nineteenth century jews were described as scurrilous stupid and tight fisted but after the jewish emancipation and the rise of jews to the middle or upper class in europe were portrayed as clever devious and manipulative financiers out to dominate the sum of what we regard as the authentic philosophy of aristotle as transmitted by al farabi and avicenna can be reduced to three parts a part which must be branded as unbelief a part which must be stigmatized as innovation and a part which need not be repudiated at all
avicenna made an argument for the existence of god which would be known as the proof of the truthful
avicenna argued that there must be a necessary existent an entity that cannot not exist and through a series of arguments he identified it with the islamic conception of god
present day historian of philosophy peter adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for gods existence and avicennas biggest contribution to the history of philosophy
correspondence between avicenna and al biruni has survived in which they debated aristotelian natural philosophy and the peripatetic school
abu rayhan began by asking avicenna eighteen questions ten of which were criticisms of aristotles on the heavens
avicenna was a devout muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with islamic theology
his aim was to prove the existence of god and his creation of the world scientifically and through reason and logic
avicennas views on islamic theology were enormously influential forming part of the core of the curriculum at islamic religious schools until the th century
avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with islamic theology
these included treatises on the prophets and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the quran such as how quranic cosmology corresponds to his own philosophical system
in general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to islamic religious ideas for example the bodys afterlife
there are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion
he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory if prophecy could be questioned and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers
later interpretations of avicennas philosophy split into three different schools those who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances those who considered avicennas theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns and those who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means
it was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al razi which eventually came to predominate in the madrasahs
avicenna memorized the quran by the age of ten and as an adult he wrote five treatises commenting on suras from the quran
one of these texts included the proof of prophecies in which he comments on several quranic verses and holds the quran in high esteem
avicenna argued that the islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers
avicenna is generally understood to have been aligned with the sunni hanafi school of thought
avicenna studied hanafi law many of his notable teachers were hanafi jurists and he served under the hanafi court of ali ibn mamun
avicenna said at an early age that he remained unconvinced by ismaili missionary attempts to convert him
medieval historian ahr al dn al bayhaq also believed avicenna to be a follower of the brethren of purity
while he was imprisoned in the castle of fardajan near hamadhan avicenna wrote his famous floating man literally falling man a thought experiment to demonstrate human self awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul
avicenna believed his floating man thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input
the thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air isolated from all which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies
he argued that in this scenario one would still have self consciousness
because it is conceivable that a person suspended in air while cut off from sense experience would still be capable of determining his own existence the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection independent of the body and an immaterial substance
the conceivability of this floating man indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually which entails the souls separateness from the body
avicenna referred to the living human intelligence particularly the active intellect which he believed to be the hypostasis by which god communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature
following is an english translation of the argument however avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation
sensation prepares the soul to receive rational concepts from the universal agent intellect
the first knowledge of the flying person would be i am affirming his or her essence
that essence could not be the body obviously as the flying person has no sensation
thus the knowledge that i am is the core of a human being the soul exists and is self aware
avicenna thus concluded that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms but as a primary given a substance
the body is unnecessary in relation to it the soul is its perfection
in itself the soul is an immaterial substance
avicenna authored a five volume medical encyclopedia the canon of medicine
it was used as the standard medical textbook in the islamic world and europe up to the th century
the canon still plays an important role in unani medicine
avicenna considered whether events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes
he used the example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events
this view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the enlightenment by seven centuries
avicenna wrote on earth sciences such as geology in the book of healing
while discussing the formation of mountains he explained in the al burhan section of the book of healing avicenna discussed the philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry
he discussed aristotles posterior analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points
avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of how does one acquire the first principles of a science he asked how a scientist would arrive at the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises he explained that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a relation holds between the terms which would allow for absolute universal certainty
avicenna then added two further methods for arriving at the first principles the ancient aristotelian method of induction and the method of examination and experimentation
avicenna criticized aristotelian induction arguing that it does not lead to the absolute universal and certain premises that it purports to provide
in its place he developed a method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry
an early formal system of temporal logic was studied by avicenna
although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions he did study the relationship between temporalis and the implication
avicennas work was further developed by najm al dn al qazwn al ktib and became the dominant system of islamic logic until modern times
avicennian logic also influenced several early european logicians such as albertus magnus and william of ockham
avicenna endorsed the law of non contradiction proposed by aristotle that a fact could not be both true and false at the same time and in the same sense of the terminology used
he stated anyone who denies the law of non contradiction should be beaten and burned until he admits that to be beaten is not the same as not to be beaten and to be burned is not the same as not to be burned
in mechanics avicenna in the book of healing developed a theory of motion in which he made a distinction between the inclination and force of a projectile and concluded that motion was a result of an inclination transferred to the projectile by the thrower and that projectile motion in a vacuum would not cease
he viewed inclination as a permanent force whose effect is dissipated by external forces such as air resistance
the theory of motion presented by avicenna was probably influenced by the th century alexandrian scholar john philoponus
avicennas is a less sophisticated variant of the theory of impetus developed by buridan in the th century
it is unclear if buridan was influenced by avicenna or by philoponus directly
in optics avicenna was among those who argued that light had a speed observing that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source the speed of light must be finite
he also provided a wrong explanation of the rainbow phenomenon
carl benjamin boyer described avicennas theory on the rainbow as follows avicennas legacy in classical psychology is primarily embodied in the kitab al nafs parts of his kitab al shifa and kitab al najat
these were known in latin under the title de anima
notably avicenna develops what is called the flying man argument in the psychology of the cure i as defence of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension which has an affinity with descartess cogito argument
avicennas psychology requires that connection between the body and soul be strong enough to ensure the souls individuation but weak enough to allow for its immortality
avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception
thus the philosophers connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception in this way bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect
in sense perception the perceiver senses the form of the object first by perceiving features of the object by our external senses
this sensory information is supplied to the internal senses which merge all the pieces into a whole unified conscious experience
this process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body for the material body may only perceive material objects while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial universal forms
the way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction which takes place in the physical body
the soul completes the action of intellection by accepting forms that have been abstracted from matter
this process requires a concrete particular to be abstracted into the universal intelligible
the material and immaterial interact through the active intellect which is a divine light containing the intelligible forms
the active intellect reveals the universals concealed in material objects much like the sun makes colour available to our eyes
avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled resla f ebl akm al nojm in which he cited passages from the quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future
he believed that each planet had some influence on the earth but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects
avicennas astronomical writings had some influence on later writers although in general his work could be considered less developed than alhazen or al biruni
one important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology
he criticized aristotles view of the stars receiving their light from the sun stating that the stars are self luminous and believed that the planets are also self luminous
he claimed to have observed venus as a spot on the sun
this is possible as there was a transit on may but avicenna did not give the date of his observation and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time he may have mistaken a sunspot for venus
he used his transit observation to help establish that venus was at least sometimes below the sun in ptolemaic cosmology ie the sphere of venus comes before the sphere of the sun when moving out from the earth in the prevailing geocentric model
he also wrote the summary of the almagest with an appended treatise to bring that which is stated in the almagest and what is understood from natural science into conformity
for example avicenna considers the motion of the solar apogee which ptolemy had taken to be fixed
avicenna was first to derive the attar of flowers from distillation and used steam distillation to produce essential oils such as rose essence which he used as aromatherapeutic treatments for heart conditions
almost half of avicennas works are versified
his poems appear in both arabic and persian
as an example edward granville browne claims that the following persian verses are incorrectly attributed to omar khayym and were originally written by ibn sn robert wisnovsky a scholar of avicenna attached to mcgill university says that avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in islam particularly in the fields of metaphysics logic and medicine but that his works didnt only have an influence in these secular fields of knowledge alone as these works or portions of them were read taught copied commented upon quoted paraphrased and cited by thousands of post avicennian scholars not only philosophers logicians physicians and specialists in the mathematical or exact sciences but also by those who specialized in the disciplines of ilm al kalm and usl al fiqh
as early as the th century when dante alighieri depicted him in limbo alongside the virtuous non christian thinkers in his divine comedy such as virgil averroes homer horace ovid lucan socrates plato and saladin
avicenna has been recognized by both east and west as one of the great figures in intellectual history
johannes kepler cites avicennas opinion when discussing the causes of planetary motions in chapter of astronomia nova
george sarton the author of the history of science described avicenna as one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history
quotations from famous historians of science cyberistan
and called him the most famous scientist of islam and one of the most famous of all races places and times
he was one of the islamic worlds leading writers in the field of medicine
along with rhazes abulcasis ibn al nafis and al ibadi avicenna is considered an important compiler of early muslim medicine
he is remembered in the western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the european renaissance
his medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between galen and aristotles views on medical matters he preferred to side with aristotle where necessary updating aristotles position to take into account post aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge
aristotles dominant intellectual influence among medieval european scholars meant that avicennas linking of galens medical writings with aristotles philosophical writings in the canon of medicine significantly increased avicennas importance in medieval europe in comparison to other islamic writers on medicine
his influence following translation of the canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid sixteenth centuries he was ranked with hippocrates and galen as one of the acknowledged authorities
institutions in a variety of counties have been named after avicenna in honour of his scientific accomplishments including the avicenna mausoleum and museum bu ali sina university avicenna research institute and ibn sina academy of medieval medicine and sciences
there is also a crater on the moon named avicenna
the avicenna prize established in is awarded every two years by unesco and rewards individuals and groups for their achievements in the field of ethics in science
the avicenna directories list universities and schools where doctors public health practitioners pharmacists and others are educated

the soviet film youth of genius by recounts avicennas younger years
the film is set in bukhara at the turn of the millennium
in louis lamours historical novel the walking drum kerbouchard studies and discusses avicennas the canon of medicine
in his book the physician noah gordon tells the story of a young english medical apprentice who disguises himself as a jew to travel from england to persia and learn from avicenna the great master of his time
the novel was adapted into a feature film the physician in
avicenna was played by ben kingsley
the treatises of avicenna influenced later muslim thinkers in many areas including theology philology mathematics astronomy physics and music
his works numbered almost volumes on a wide range of subjects of which around have survived
in particular volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and of them concentrate on medicine
his most famous works are the book of healing and the canon of medicine
avicenna wrote at least one treatise on alchemy but several others have been falsely attributed to him
his logic metaphysics physics and de caelo are treatises giving a synoptic view of aristotelian doctrine though metaphysics demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of neoplatonism known as aristotelianism in avicennas world arabic philosophers have hinted at the idea that avicenna was attempting to re aristotelianise muslim philosophy in its entirety unlike his predecessors who accepted the conflation of platonic aristotelian neo and middle platonic works transmitted into the muslim world
the logic and metaphysics have been extensively reprinted the latter eg at venice in and
some of his shorter essays on medicine logic etc
take a poetical form
two encyclopedic treatises dealing with philosophy are often mentioned
the larger al shifa exists nearly complete in manuscript in the bodleian library and elsewhere part of it on the de anima appeared at pavia as the liber sextus naturalium and the long account of avicennas philosophy given by muhammad al shahrastani seems to be mainly an analysis and in many places a reproduction of the al shifa
a shorter form of the work is known as the an najat
the latin editions of part of these works have been modified by the corrections which the monastic editors confess that they applied
there is also a mentioned by roger bacon the majority of which is lost in antiquity which according to averroes was pantheistic in tone
avicennas most important persian work is the danishnama i alai
avicenna created new scientific vocabulary that had not previously existed in persian
the danishnama covers such topics as logic metaphysics music theory and other sciences of his time
it has been translated into english by parwiz morewedge in
the book is also important in respect to persian scientific works
andar danesh e rag contains nine chapters on the science of the pulse and is a condensed synopsis
persian poetry from avicenna is recorded in various manuscripts and later anthologies such as nozhat al majales
the ashes is a test cricket series played between england and australia
the term originated in a satirical obituary published in a british newspaper the sporting times immediately after australias victory at the oval its first test win on english soil
the obituary stated that english cricket had died and that the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to australia
the mythical ashes immediately became associated with the series played in australia before which the english captain ivo bligh had vowed to regain those ashes
the english media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the ashes
after england had won two of the three tests on the tour a small urn was presented to bligh by a group of melbourne women including florence morphy whom bligh married within a year
the contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden bail and were humorously described as the ashes of australian cricket
it is not clear whether that tiny silver urn is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the mcc by blighs widow after his death in
the urn has never been the official trophy of the ashes series having been a personal gift to bligh
however replicas of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an ashes series
since the ashes series a waterford crystal representation of the ashes urn has been presented to the winners of an ashes series as the official trophy of that series
irrespective of which side holds the tournament the original urn remains in the mcc museum at lords it has however been taken to australia to be put on touring display on two occasions as part of the australian bicentenary celebrations in and to accompany the ashes series in
an ashes series traditionally consists of five tests hosted in turn by england and australia at least once every two years
the ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the series
if the series is drawn the team that currently holds the ashes retains the trophy
there have been ashes series australia have won england have won and six series have been drawn
the first test match between england and australia was played in melbourne australia in though the ashes legend started later after the ninth test played in
on their tour of england that year the australians played just one test at the oval in london
it was a low scoring affair on a difficult wicket
australia made a mere runs in their first innings and england led by a
hornby took a run lead with a total of
in their second innings australia boosted by a spectacular runs off deliveries from hugh massie managed which left england only runs to win
the australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second innings collapse but fast bowler fred spofforth spurred on by the gamesmanship of his opponents in particular w
grace refused to give in
this thing can be done he declared
spofforth went on to devastate the english batting taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave england just eight runs short of victory
when ted peate englands last batsman came to the crease his side needed just ten runs to win but peate managed only two before he was bowled by harry boyle
an astonished oval crowd fell silent struggling to believe that england could possibly have lost on home soil
when it finally sank in the crowd swarmed onto the field cheering loudly and chairing boyle and spofforth to the pavilion
when peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner charles studd to get the runs
peate humorously replied i had no confidence in mr studd sir so thought i had better do my best
the momentous defeat was widely recorded in the british press which praised the australians for their plentiful pluck and berated the englishmen for their lack thereof
a celebrated poem appeared in punch on saturday september
the first verse quoted most frequently reads well done whipt us fair and square was it luck that tript us was it scare kangaroo lands demon or our own want of devil coolness nerve backbone on september a more celebrated mock obituary written by reginald shirley brooks appeared in the sporting times
it read ivo bligh promised that on tour of australia he would as englands captain recover those ashes
he spoke of them several times over the course of the tour and the australian media quickly caught on
the three match series resulted in a two one win to england notwithstanding a fourth match won by the australians whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute
in the years following blighs campaign the term the ashes largely disappeared from public use
there is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series at least not in england
the term became popular again in australia first when george giffen in his memoirs used the term as if it were well known
the true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from when pelham warner took a team to australia with the promise that he would regain the ashes
as had been the case on blighs tour years before the australian media latched fervently onto the term and this time it stuck
having fulfilled his promise warner published a book entitled how we recovered the ashes
although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text the title served to revive public interest in the legend
the first mention of the ashes in wisden cricketers almanack occurs in while wisdens first account of the legend is in the edition
it took many years before the contests between england and australia were consistently called the ashes and so there was no concept of either a trophy or a physical representation of the ashes
as late as the following verse appeared in the cricketers annual so heres to chapman hendren and hobbs gilligan woolley and hearne may they bring back to the motherland the ashes which have no urn nevertheless several attempts had been made to embody the ashes in a physical memorial
examples include one presented to warner in another to australian captain m
noble in and another to australian captain w
woodfull in
the oldest and the one to enjoy enduring fame was the one presented to bligh later lord darnley during the tour
the precise nature of the origin of this urn is matter of dispute
based on a statement by darnley in it was believed that a group of victorian ladies including darnleys later wife florence morphy made the presentation after the victory in the third test in
more recent researchers in particular ronald willis and joy munns have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over christmas when the english team were guests of sir william clarke at his property rupertswood in sunbury victoria
this was before the matches had started
the prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of clarke
in august ivo bligh displayed the ashes urn at the morning post decorative art exhibition held in the central hall westminster
he made the following statement about how he was given the urn a more detailed account of how the ashes were given to ivo bligh was outlined by his wife the countess of darnley in during a speech at a cricket luncheon
her speech was reported by the times as follows there is another statement which is not totally clear made by lord darnley in about the timing of the presentation of the urn
he was interviewed in his home at cobham hall by montague grover and the report of this interview was as follows he made a similar statement in
the report of this statement in the brisbane courier was as follows the contents of the urn are also problematic they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump bail or the outer casing of a ball but in darnleys year old daughter in law said they were the remains of her mother in laws veil casting a further layer of doubt on the matter
however during the tour of australia in the mcc official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted and it was now certain that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail
speaking on channel nine tv on november he said x rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked and repair work had to be carried out
the urn is made of terracotta and is about tall and may originally have been a perfume jar
a label containing a six line verse is pasted on the urn
this is the fourth verse of a song lyric published in the melbourne punch on february when ivo goes back with the urn the urn studds steel read and tylecote return return the will ring loud the great crowd will feel proud seeing barlow and bates with the urn the urn and the rest coming home with the urn
in february just before the disputed fourth test a velvet bag made by mrs ann fletcher the daughter of joseph hines clarke and marion wright both of dublin was given to bligh to contain the urn
during darnleys lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn and no record of a published photograph exists before
the illustrated london news published this photo in january
when darnley died in his widow presented the urn to the marylebone cricket club and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes
mcc first displayed the urn in the long room at lords and since in the mcc cricket museum at the ground
mccs wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy
it is in fact a private memento and for this reason it is never awarded to either england or australia but is kept permanently in the mcc cricket museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the match
because the urn itself is so delicate it has been allowed to travel to australia only twice
the first occasion was in for a museum tour as part of the australian bicentenary celebrations the second was for the ashes series
the urn arrived on october going on display at the museum of sydney
it then toured to other states with the final appearance at the tasmanian museum and art gallery on january
in the s given australias long dominance of the ashes and the popular acceptance of the darnley urn as the ashes the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series
as its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the mcc cricket museum the mcc would not agree
furthermore in blighs great great grandson lord clifton the heir apparent to the earldom of darnley argued that the ashes urn should not be returned to australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the mcc only for safe keeping
as a compromise the mcc commissioned a larger replica of the urn in waterford crystal known as the ashes trophy to award to the winning team of each series starting with the ashes
this did little to diminish the status of the darnley urn as the most important icon in cricket the symbol of this old and keenly fought contest
later in following the famous australian victory at the oval bligh led an england team to australia as he said to recover those ashes
publicity surrounding the series was intense and it was at some time during this series that the ashes urn was crafted
australia won the first test by nine wickets but in the next two england were victorious
at the end of the third test england were generally considered to have won back the ashes
a fourth match was played against a united australian xi which was arguably stronger than the australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches this game however is not generally considered part of the series
it is counted as a test but as a standalone
this match ended in a victory for australia
after blighs victory there was an extended period of english dominance
the tours generally had fewer tests in the s and s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years the first five test series taking place only in
england lost only four ashes tests in the s out of played and they won all the seven series contested
there was more chopping and changing in the teams given that there was no official board of selectors for each country and popularity with the fans varied
the s games were more closely fought australia taking its first series win since with a victory in
but england dominated winning the next three series to despite continuing player disputes
the series began in sensational fashion when england won the first test at sydney by just runs having followed on
australia had scored a massive and then dismissed england for
but england responded with and then dramatically dismissed australia for with bobby peel taking for
at the close of the second last days play australia were needing only more runs
but heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left arm bowlers peel and johnny briggs were all but unplayable
england went on to win the series after it had been all square before the final test which england won by wickets
the english heroes were peel with wickets in the series at an average of and tom richardson with at
in england under the captaincy of w
grace won the series and this marked the end of englands longest period of ashes dominance
australia resoundingly won the series by under the captaincy of harry trott
his successor joe darling won the next three series in and the classic series which became one of the most famous in the history of test cricket
five matches were played in but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather
in the first test after scoring england bowled out australia for and reduced them to when they followed on
australia won the third and fourth tests at bramall lane and old trafford respectively
at old trafford australia won by just runs after victor trumper had scored on a bad wicket reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day
england won the last test at the oval by one wicket
chasing to win they slumped to before gilbert jessops gave them a chance
he reached his hundred in just minutes
the last wicket pair of george hirst and rhodes were required to score runs for victory
when rhodes joined him hirst reportedly said well get them in singles wilfred
in fact they scored thirteen singles and a two
the period of darlings captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding australian players such as trumper warwick armstrong james kelly monty noble clem hill hugh trumble and ernie jones
after what the mcc saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves and this led to the first mcc tour of australia in
england won it against the odds and plum warner the england captain wrote up his version of the tour in his book how we recovered the ashes
the title of this book revived the ashes legend and it was after this that england v australia series were customarily referred to as the ashes
england and australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the first world war in
five more series took place between and
in englands captain stanley jackson not only won the series but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages
monty noble led australia to victory in both and
then england won in by four matches to one
jack hobbs establishing himself as englands first choice opening batsman with three centuries while frank foster and sydney barnes formed a formidable bowling partnership
england retained the ashes when it won the triangular tournament which also featured south africa
the australian touring party had been severely weakened by a dispute between the board and players that caused clem hill victor trumper warwick armstrong tibby cotter sammy carter and vernon ransford to be omitted
after the war australia took firm control of both the ashes and world cricket
for the first time the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as jack gregory and ted mcdonald crippled the english batting on a regular basis
australia recorded overwhelming victories both in england and on home soil
it won the first eight matches in succession including a whitewash in at the hands of warwick armstrongs team
the ruthless and belligerent armstrong led his team back to england in where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of england without defeat
england won only one test out of from the end of the war until
in a rain hit series in england managed to eke out a victory with a win in the final test at the oval
because the series was at stake the match was to be timeless ie played to a finish
australia had a narrow first innings lead of
jack hobbs and herbert sutcliffe took the score to at the end of the second day a lead of
heavy rain fell overnight and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket
england seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match
in spite of the very difficult batting conditions however hobbs and sutcliffe took their partnership to before hobbs was out for exactly
sutcliffe went on to make and england won the game comfortably
australian captain herbie collins was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level and some accused him of throwing the match
australias ageing post war team broke up after with collins charlie macartney and warren bardsley all departing and gregory breaking down at the start of the series
despite the debut of donald bradman the inexperienced australians led by jack ryder were heavily defeated losing
england had a very strong batting side with wally hammond contributing runs at an average of and hobbs sutcliffe and patsy hendren all scoring heavily the bowling was more than adequate without being outstanding
in bill woodfull led an extremely inexperienced team to england
bradman fulfilled his promise in the series when he scored runs at which remains a world record test series aggregate
a modest bradman can be heard in a recording saying i have always endeavoured to do my best for the side and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches
my one idea when going into bat was to make runs for australia
in the headingley test he made reaching at the end of the first day including a century before lunch
bradman himself thought that his in the preceding match at lords was a better innings
england managed to stay in contention until the deciding final test at the oval but yet another double hundred by bradman and by percy hornibrook in englands second innings enabled australia to win by an innings and take the series
clarrie grimmetts wickets at for australia in this high scoring series were also important
australia had one of the strongest batting line ups ever in the early s with bradman archie jackson stan mccabe bill woodfull bill ponsford and jack fingleton
it was the prospect of bowling at this line up that caused englands captain douglas jardine to adopt the tactic of fast leg theory better known as bodyline
jardine instructed his fast bowlers most notably harold larwood and bill voce to bowl at the bodies of the australian batsmen with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats thus providing easy catches to a stacked leg side field
jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it leg theory but it was widely disparaged by its opponents who dubbed it bodyline
although england decisively won the ashes bodyline caused such a furore in australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to anglo australian relations and the mcc eventually changed the laws of cricket to curtail the number of leg side fielders
jardines comment was ive not travelled miles to make friends
im here to win the ashes
some of the australians wanted to use bodyline in retaliation but woodfull flatly refused
he famously told england manager pelham warner there are two teams out there
one is playing cricket the other is making no attempt to do so after the latter had come into the australian rooms to express sympathy after a larwood bouncer had struck the australian skipper in the heart and felled him
on the batting friendly wickets that prevailed in the late s most tests up to the second world war still gave results
it should be borne in mind that tests in australia prior to the war were all played to a finish with many batting records set during this period
the ashes series began with the notable absence of larwood voce and jardine
the mcc had made it clear in light of the revelations of the bodyline series that these players would not face australia
the mcc although it had earlier condoned and encouraged bodyline tactics in the series laid the blame on larwood when relations turned sour
larwood was forced by the mcc to either apologise or be removed from the test side
he went for the latter
australia recovered the ashes in and held them until though no test cricket was played during the second world war
as in the series was decided in the final test at the oval
australia batting first posted a massive in the first innings
bradman and ponsford were in record breaking form with a partnership of for the second wicket
england eventually faced a massive run target for victory and failed australia winning the series
this made woodfull the only captain to regain the ashes and he retired upon his return to australia
in bradman succeeded woodfull as australian captain
he started badly losing the first two tests heavily after australia were caught on sticky wickets
however the australians fought back and bradman won his first series in charge
the series was a high scoring affair with two high scoring draws resulting in a result australia retaining the ashes
after the first two matches ended in stalemate and the third test at old trafford never started due to rain australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low scoring match at headingley to retain the urn
in the timeless fifth test at the oval the highlight was len huttons then world record score of as england made declared
bradman and jack fingleton injured themselves during huttons marathon effort and with only nine men australia fell to defeat by an innings and runs the heaviest in test history
the ashes resumed after the war when england toured in and as in found that australia had made the better post war recovery
still captained by bradman and now featuring the potent new ball partnership of ray lindwall and keith miller australia were convincing winners
aged and having been unwell during the war bradman had been reluctant to play
he batted unconvincingly and reached when he hit a ball to jack ikin england believed it was a catch but bradman stood his ground believing it to be a bump ball
the umpire ruled in the australian captains favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear scoring
australia promptly seized the initiative won the first test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post war era
the controversy over the ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era
in australia set new standards completely outplaying its hosts to win with one draw
this australian team led by bradman who turned during his final tour of england has gone down in history as the invincibles
playing matches on tour three of which were not first class and including the five tests they remained unbeaten winning and drawing
bradmans men were greeted by packed crowds across the country and records for test attendances in england were set in the second and fourth tests at lords and headingley respectively
before a record attendance of spectators at headingley australia set a world record by chasing down on the last day for a seven wicket victory
the series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history as bradman played his final innings for australia in the fifth test at the oval needing to score only four runs to end with a career batting average of exactly
however bradman made a second ball duck bowled by an eric hollies googly that sent him into retirement with a career average of
bradman was succeeded as australian captain by lindsay hassett who led the team to a series victory in
the series was not as one sided as the number of wins suggest with several tight matches
the tide finally turned in when england won the final test at the oval to take the series having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding test at headingley
this was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in english cricket history with players such as captain len hutton batsmen denis compton peter may tom graveney colin cowdrey bowlers fred trueman brian statham alec bedser jim laker tony lock wicket keeper godfrey evans and all rounder trevor bailey
in australias batsmen had no answer to the pace of frank tyson and statham
after winning the first test by an innings after being controversially sent in by hutton australia lost its way and england took a hat trick of victories to win the series
a dramatic series in saw a record that will probably never be beaten off spinner jim lakers monumental effort at old trafford when he bowled of overs to take out of possible australian wickets in the fourth test
it was australias second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn tests in which half the playing time was washed out
bradman rated the team that won the series as englands best ever
englands dominance was not to last
australia won in having found a high quality spinner of their own in new skipper richie benaud who took wickets in the five test series and paceman alan davidson who took wickets at
the series was overshadowed by the furore over various australian bowlers most notably ian meckiff whom the english management and media accused of illegally throwing australia to victory
in australia won a hard fought series their first ashes series win in england for years
after narrowly winning the second test at lords dubbed the battle of the ridge because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the fourth test at old trafford and sealed the series with richie benaud taking during the english runchase
the tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the s held in and
the powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement and their replacements were of lesser quality making it more difficult to force a result
england failed to win any series during the s a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing
of the tests played during the four series australia won four and england three
as they held the ashes australias captains bob simpson and bill lawry were happy to adopt safety first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws
during this period spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased but simpson and lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction
it was in the s that the bipolar dominance of england and australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time
west indies defeated england twice in the mid s and south africa in two series before they were banned for apartheid completely outplayed australia and
australia had lost during a tour of the west indies in the first time it had lost a series to any team other than england
in ray illingworth led england to a win in australia mainly due to john snows fast bowling and the prolific batting of geoffrey boycott and john edrich
it was not until the last session of what was the th test that englands success was secured
lawry was sacked after the sixth test after the selectors finally lost patience with australias lack of success and dour strategy
lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio
the series finished with england under illingworth retaining the ashes
in the series with the england team breaking up and their best batsman geoff boycott refusing to play australian pace bowlers jeff thomson and dennis lillee wreaked havoc
a result was a fair reflection as england were left shell shocked
england then lost the series but at least restored some pride under new captain tony greig
australia won the centenary test which was not an ashes contest but then a storm broke as kerry packer announced his intention to form world series cricket
wsc affected all test playing nations but it weakened australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with packer the australian cricket board would not select wsc contracted players and an almost completely new test team had to be formed
wsc came after an era during which the duopoly of australian and english dominance dissipated the ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the west indies in the late s challenged that view
the west indies would go on to record resounding test series wins over australia and england and dominated world cricket until the s
with greig having joined wsc england appointed mike brearley as its captain and he enjoyed great success against australia
largely assisted by the return of boycott brearleys men won the series and then completed an overwhelming series win against an australian side missing its wsc players in
allan border made his test debut for australia in
brearley retired from test cricket in and was succeeded by ian botham who started the series as england captain by which time the wsc split had ended
after australia took a lead in the first two tests botham was forced to resign or was sacked
brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the third test at headingley
this was a remarkable match in which australia looked certain to take a series lead after it had forced england to follow on runs behind
england despite being for produced a second innings total of botham scoring
chasing just australia were sensationally dismissed for bob willis taking
it was the first time since that a team following on had won a test match
under brearleys leadership england went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at the oval
this series became known as bothams ashes for his extraordinary feats with both bat and ball after being dismissed as captain
in australia had greg chappell back from wsc as captain while the england team was weakened by the enforced omission of their south african tour rebels particularly graham gooch and john emburey
australia went up after three tests but england won the fourth test by runs to set up the final decider which was drawn
in david gowers england team was strengthened by the return of gooch and emburey as well as the emergence at international level of tim robinson and mike gatting
australia now captained by allan border had itself been weakened by a rebel south african tour the loss of terry alderman being a particular factor
england won
despite suffering heavy defeats against the west indies during the s england continued to do well in the ashes
mike gatting was the captain in but his team started badly and attracted some criticism
then chris broad scored three hundreds in successive tests and bowling successes from graham dilley and gladstone small meant england won the series
the australian team of was comparable to the great australian teams of the past and resoundingly defeated england
well led by allan border the team included the young cricketers mark taylor merv hughes david boon ian healy and steve waugh who were all to prove long serving and successful ashes competitors
england now led once again by david gower suffered from injuries and poor form
during the fourth test news broke that prominent england players had agreed to take part in a rebel tour of south africa the following winter three of them were playing in the match and were subsequently dropped from the england side
australia reached a cricketing peak in the s and early s coupled with a general decline in englands fortunes
after re establishing its credibility in australia underlined its superiority with victories in the and series all by convincing margins
great australian players in the early years included batsmen border boon taylor and steve waugh
the captaincy passed from border to taylor in the mid s and then to steve waugh before the series
in the latter part of the s waugh himself along with his twin brother mark scored heavily for australia and fast bowlers glenn mcgrath and jason gillespie made a serious impact especially the former
the wicketkeeper batsman position was held by ian healy for most of the s and by adam gilchrist from to
in the s batsmen justin langer damien martyn and matthew hayden became noted players for australia
but the most dominant australian player was leg spinner shane warne whose first delivery in ashes cricket in to dismiss mike gatting became known as the ball of the century
australias record between and had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides
before the series began the win loss ratio was almost even with test wins for australia to englands tests having been drawn
by the series australias test wins had increased to whereas englands had increased to only
in the period between and the beginning of the series the two sides had played times australia winning times england times with draws
only a single england victory had come in a match in which the ashes were still at stake namely the first test of the series
all others were consolation victories when the ashes had been secured by australia
england were undefeated in test matches through the calendar year
this elevated them to second in the icc test championship
hopes that the ashes series would be closely fought proved well founded the series remaining undecided as the closing session of the final test began
experienced journalists including richie benaud rated the series as the most exciting in living memory
it has been compared with the great series of the distant past such as and
the first test at lords was convincingly won by australia but in the remaining four matches the teams were evenly matched and england fought back to win the second test by runs the smallest winning margin in ashes history and the second smallest in all tests
the rain affected third test ended with the last two australian batsmen holding out for a draw and england won the fourth test by three wickets after forcing australia to follow on for the first time in tests
a draw in the final test gave england victory in an ashes series for the first time in years and their first ashes victory at home since
australia regained the ashes on its home turf in the series with a convincing victory only the second time an ashes series had been won by that margin
glenn mcgrath shane warne and justin langer retired from test cricket after that series while damien martyn retired during the series
the series began with a tense draw in the first test at swalec stadium in cardiff with englands last wicket batsmen james anderson and monty panesar surviving balls
england then achieved its first ashes win at lords since to go up
after a rain affected draw at edgbaston the fourth match at headingley was convincingly won by australia by an innings and runs to level the series
finally england won the fifth test at the oval by a margin of runs to regain the ashes
andrew flintoff retired from test cricket soon afterwards
the series was played in australia
the first test at brisbane ended in a draw but england won the second test at adelaide by an innings and runs
australia came back with a victory at perth in the third test
in the fourth test at melbourne cricket ground england batting second scored to defeat australia by an innings and runs
this gave england an unbeatable lead in the series and so it retained the ashes
england went on to win the series beating australia by an innings and runs at sydney in the fifth test including their highest innings total since
englands series victory was its first on australian soil for years
the ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three tests by innings margins and it was the first time england had scored or more four times in a single series
england opener cook scored runs at average in the series the most dominant batsman in an ashes series since bradman in
australias build up to the ashes series was far from ideal
darren lehmann took over as coach from mickey arthur following a string of poor results
a batting line up weakened by the previous years retirements of former captain ricky ponting and mike hussey was also shorn of opener david warner who was suspended for the start of the series following an off field incident
england won a closely fought first test by runs despite year old debutant ashton agar making a world record for a number in the first innings
england then won a very one sided second test by runs while the rain affected third test held at a newly refurbished old trafford was drawn ensuring that england retained the ashes
england won the fourth test by runs after australia lost their last eight second innings wickets for only runs
the final test was drawn giving england a series win
in the second of two ashes series held in this time hosted by australia the home team won the series five test matches to nil
this was the third time australia has completed a clean sweep in ashes history a feat never matched by england
all six australian specialist batsmen scored more runs than any englishman with centuries among them with only debutant ben stokes scoring a century for england
mitchell johnson took english wickets at and ryan harris wickets at in the test series
only stuart broad and all rounder stokes bowled effectively for england with their spinner graeme swann retiring due to a chronic elbow injury after the decisive third test
australia came into the ashes series in england as favourites to retain the ashes
although england won the first test in cardiff australia won comfortably in the second test at lords
in the next two tests the australian batsmen struggled being bowled out for in the first innings at edgbaston with england proceeding to win by eight wickets
this was followed by australia being bowled out for as stuart broad took five wickets and finished the spell with for in the first innings at trent bridge the quickest in terms of balls faced a team has been bowled out in the first innings of a test match
with victory by an innings and runs on the morning of the third day of the fourth test england regained the ashes
during the buildup the ashes series was regarded as a turning point for both sides
australia were criticised for being too reliant on captain steve smith and vice captain david warner while england was said to have a shoddy middle to lower order
off the field england all rounder ben stokes was ruled out of the side indefinitely due to a police investigation
australia won the first test match in brisbane by wickets and the second test at adelaide by runs in the first ever day night ashes test match
australia regained the ashes with an innings and run win in the third test at perth the final ashes test at the waca ground
prior to the ashes series both teams were considered to have very strong bowling attacks but struggling batting orders
australia had its top order batsmen david warner steve smith and cameron bancroft available for international selection after being banned from international cricket for months following the ball tampering scandal in south africa during which time india had won its first ever test series in australia
however australia recovered to win the test series against sri lanka
despite winning the cricket world cup in july for the first time england had also been criticised for its fragile top order in tests
the retirement of opener alastair cook in august ensured potential top order batsmen rory burns joe denly and jason roy were able to secure a place in the side
despite losing a test series in their tour of the west indies england then improved to win the one off test against ireland by runs
the series was eventually drawn with australia retaining the ashes
the ashes series was played from december through january and featured the first ashes test match to be played in tasmania at hobarts bellerive oval
australia retained the ashes in the ashes series after beating england
in the years since australia have held the ashes for approximately years and england for years a team must win a series to gain the right to hold the ashes
a drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the ashes
ashes series have generally been played over five test matches although there have been four match series and six match series
australians have made centuries in ashes tests of which have been scores over while englishmen have scored centuries of which have been over
australians have taken wickets in a match on occasions englishmen times
the series alternates between england and australia and each match of a series is held at a different ground
in australia the grounds currently used are the gabba in brisbane adelaide oval the melbourne cricket ground and the sydney cricket ground
a single test was held at the brisbane exhibition ground in
traditionally melbourne hosts the boxing day test and sydney hosts the new years day test
additionally the waca in perth hosted its final ashes test in and was due to be replaced by perth stadium for the series
however western australian border restrictions and quarantine requirements during the covid pandemic led to a change in venue for the final ashes test to bellerive oval in hobart
this was the first ashes test match to be held in tasmania
cricket australia proposed that the series consist of six tests with the additional game to be played at bellerive oval in hobart
the england and wales cricket board declined and the series was played over five tests
in england and wales the grounds currently used are old trafford in manchester the oval in kennington south london lords in st johns wood north london headingley in leeds and edgbaston in birmingham
additionally sophia gardens in cardiff wales the riverside ground in chester le street county durham and trent bridge at west bridgford have been used and one test was also held at bramall lane in sheffield in
traditionally the final test of the series is played at the oval
sophia gardens and the riverside were excluded as test grounds between the years of and and therefore will not host an ashes test until at least
the ecb announced the and ashes series venues will held at lords the oval edgbaston trent bridge the rose bowl old trafford and headingley
county cricket clubs who play at the grounds former grounds which no longer host test matches the popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports and games using the name ashes for contests between england great britain and australia
the best known and longest running of these events is the rugby league rivalry between great britain and australia
use of the name ashes was suggested by the australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in
other examples included the television game shows gladiators and sale of the century both of which broadcast special editions containing contestants from the australian and english versions of the shows competing against each other
the term became further genericised in australia in the first half of the twentieth century and was used to describe many sports rivalries or competitions outside the context of australia vs england
the australian rules football interstate carnival and the small silver casket which served as its trophy were symbolically known as the ashes of australian football and was spoken of as such until at least the s
the soccer rivalry between australia and new zealand was described as the soccer ashes of australasia until as late as the s ashes from cigars smoked by the two countries captains were put into a casket in to make the trophy literal
the interstate rugby league rivalry between queensland and new south wales was known for a time as australias rugby league ashes and bowls competitions between the two states also regularly used the term
even some local rivalries such as southern western australias annual great southern football carnival were locally described as the ashes
this genericised usage is no longer common and the ashes would today be assumed only to apply to a contest between australia and england
the ashes featured in the film the final test released in based on a television play by terence rattigan
it stars jack warner as an england cricketer playing the last test of his career which is the last of an ashes series the film includes cameo appearances of english captain len hutton and other players who were part of englands triumph
douglas adamss science fiction comedy novel life the universe and everything the third part of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy series features the urn containing the ashes as a significant element of its plot
the urn is stolen by alien robots as the burnt stump inside is part of a key needed to unlock the wikkit gate and release an imprisoned world called krikkit
bodyline a fictionalised television miniseries based on the bodyline ashes series of was screened in australia in
the cast included gary sweet as donald bradman and hugo weaving as england captain douglas jardine
in the film the lady vanishes charters and caldicott played by basil radford and naunton wayne are two cricket fans who are desperate to get home from europe in order to see the last days play in the rd test at manchester
it is not until they see a newsboys poster near the end of the film that they discover that the match had been abandoned due to floods
analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it
the technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before aristotle though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development
the word comes from the ancient greek
from it also comes the words plural analyses
as a formal concept the method has variously been ascribed to alhazen ren descartes and galileo galilei
it has also been ascribed to isaac newton in the form of a practical method of physical discovery
the converse of analysis is synthesis putting the pieces back together again in a new or different whole
the field of chemistry uses analysis in three ways to identify the components of a particular chemical compound to identify the proportions of components in a mixture and to break down chemical processes and examine chemical reactions between elements of matter
for an example of its use analysis of the concentration of elements is important in managing a nuclear reactor so nuclear scientists will analyze neutron activation to develop discrete measurements within vast samples
a matrix can have a considerable effect on the way a chemical analysis is conducted and the quality of its results
analysis can be done manually or with a device
a qualitative analysis it is concerned with which components are in a given sample or compound
example precipitation reaction b quantitative analysis it is to determine the quantity of individual component present in a given sample or compound
example to find concentration by uv spectrophotometer
chemists can use isotope analysis to assist analysts with issues in anthropology archeology food chemistry forensics geology and a host of other questions of physical science
analysts can discern the origins of natural and man made isotopes in the study of environmental radioactivity
analysts in the field of engineering look at requirements structures mechanisms systems and dimensions
electrical engineers analyse systems in electronics
life cycles and system failures are broken down and studied by engineers
it is also looking at different factors incorporated within the design
the field of intelligence employs analysts to break down and understand a wide array of questions
intelligence agencies may use heuristics inductive and deductive reasoning social network analysis dynamic network analysis link analysis and brainstorming to sort through problems they face
military intelligence may explore issues through the use of game theory red teaming and wargaming
signals intelligence applies cryptanalysis and frequency analysis to break codes and ciphers
business intelligence applies theories of competitive intelligence analysis and competitor analysis to resolve questions in the marketplace
law enforcement intelligence applies a number of theories in crime analysis
linguistics explores individual languages and language in general
it breaks language down and analyses its component parts theory sounds and their meaning utterance usage word origins the history of words the meaning of words and word combinations sentence construction basic construction beyond the sentence level stylistics and conversation
it examines the above using statistics and modeling and semantics
it analyses language in context of anthropology biology evolution geography history neurology psychology and sociology
it also takes the applied approach looking at individual language development and clinical issues
literary criticism is the analysis of literature
the focus can be as diverse as the analysis of homer or freud
while not all literary critical methods are primarily analytical in nature the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid twentieth century literary formal analysis or close reading is
this method rooted in the academic movement labelled the new criticism approaches texts chiefly short poems such as sonnets which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves without reference to biographical or historical frameworks
this method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of prosody and phonic effects such as alliteration and rhyme and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures figurative language and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects
modern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes
it is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus
it can be applied in the study of classical concepts of mathematics such as real numbers complex variables trigonometric functions and algorithms or of non classical concepts like constructivism harmonics infinity and vectors
the terms synthesis and analysis are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic
in ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have
the oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in to euclid xiii
which in all probability was framed by eudoxus analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it
the analytic method is not conclusive unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible
to remove all doubt the greeks as a rule added to the analytic process a synthetic one consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis
thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions
the synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths
an analytic proof begins by an assumption upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded
the greeks distinguished theoretic from problematic analysis
a theoretic analysis is of the following kind
to prove that a is b assume first that a is b
if so then since b is c and c is d and d is e therefore a is e
if this be known a falsity a is not b
but if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be then the reverse process a is e e is d d is c c is b therefore a is b constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem
problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition
the problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem
in statistics the term analysis may refer to any method used for data analysis
among the many such methods some are abner doubleday was a career united states army officer and union major general in the american civil war
he fired the first shot in defense of fort sumter the opening battle of the war and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the battle of gettysburg
gettysburg was his finest hour but his relief by maj
george g
meade caused lasting enmity between the two men
in san francisco after the war he obtained a patent on the cable car railway that still runs there
in his final years in new jersey he was a prominent member and later president of the theosophical society
in years after his death doubleday was declared by the mills commission to have invented the game of baseball
this claim has been thoroughly debunked by baseball historians
doubleday the son of ulysses f
doubleday and hester donnelly was born in ballston spa new york in a small house on the corner of washington and fenwick streets
as a child abner was very short
the family all slept in the attic loft of the one room house
his paternal grandfather also named abner had fought in the american revolutionary war
his maternal grandfather thomas donnelly had joined the army at and was a mounted messenger for george washington
his great grandfather peter donnelly was a minuteman
his father ulysses f
fought in the war of published newspapers and books and represented auburn new york for four years in the united states congress
abner spent his childhood in auburn and later was sent to cooperstown to live with his uncle and attend a private preparatory high school
he practiced as a surveyor and civil engineer for two years before entering the united states military academy in
he graduated in th in a class of cadets and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the rd us artillery
in he married mary hewitt of baltimore the daughter of a local lawyer
doubleday initially served in coastal garrisons and then in the mexican american war from to and the seminole wars from to
in he was transferred to fort moultrie in charleston harbor serving under colonel john l
by the start of the civil war he was a captain and second in command in the garrison at fort sumter under major robert anderson
he aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the confederate bombardment on april
he subsequently referred to himself as the hero of sumter for this role
doubleday was promoted to major on may and commanded the artillery department in the shenandoah valley from june to august and then the artillery for major general nathaniel bankss division of the army of the potomac
he was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on february and was assigned to duty in northern virginia while the army of the potomac conducted the peninsula campaign
his first combat assignment was to lead the nd brigade st division iii corps of the army of virginia during the northern virginia campaign
in the actions at brawners farm just before the second battle of bull run he took the initiative to send two of his regiments to reinforce brigadier general john gibbons brigade against a larger confederate force fighting it to a standstill
his men were routed when they encountered major general james longstreets corps but by the following day august he took command of the division when hatch was wounded and he led his men to cover the retreat of the union army
doubleday again led the division now assigned to the i corps of the army of the potomac after south mountain where hatch was wounded again
at antietam he led his men into the deadly fighting in the cornfield and the west woods and one colonel described him as a gallant officer
remarkably cool and at the very front of battle
he was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse throwing him to the ground in a violent fall
he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his actions at antietam and was promoted in march to major general of volunteers to rank from november
at fredericksburg in december his division mostly sat idle
during the winter the i corps was reorganized and doubleday assumed command of the rd division
at chancellorsville in may the division was kept in reserve
at the start of the battle of gettysburg july doubledays division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of brigadier general john buford
when his corps commander major general john f
reynolds was killed very early in the fighting doubleday found himself in command of the corps at am
his men fought well in the morning putting up a stout resistance but as overwhelming confederate forces massed against them their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of gettysburg to the relative safety of cemetery hill south of town
it was doubledays finest performance during the war five hours leading men against ten confederate brigades that numbered more than
seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from to percent indicating the ferocity of the union defense
on cemetery hill however the i corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle it would be decommissioned in march its surviving units consolidated into other corps
on july army of the potomac commander maj
george g
meade replaced doubleday with major general john newton a more junior officer from another corps
the ostensible reason was a false report by xi corps commander major general oliver o
howard that doubledays corps broke first causing the entire union line to collapse but meade also had a long history of disdain for doubledays combat effectiveness dating back to south mountain
doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against meade but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle
he was wounded in the neck on the second day of gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service
he formally requested reinstatement as i corps commander but meade refused and doubleday left gettysburg on july for washington
doubledays staff nicknamed him forty eight hours as a compliment to recognize his tendency to avoid reckless or impulsive actions and his thoughtfulness and deliberateness in considering circumstances and possible responses
in recent years biographers have turned the nickname into an insult incorrectly claiming forty eight hours was coined to highlight doubledays supposed incompetence and slowness to act
doubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of washington dc where he was in charge of courts martial which gave him legal experience that he used after the war
his only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by confederate lieutenant general jubal a
early in the valley campaigns of
also while in washington doubleday testified against george meade at the united states congress joint committee on the conduct of the war criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the battle of gettysburg
while in washington doubleday remained a loyal republican and staunch supporter of president abraham lincoln
doubleday rode with lincoln on the train to gettysburg for the gettysburg address and col
and mrs doubleday attended events with mr and mrs lincoln in washington
after the civil war doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on august reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and became the colonel of the th us infantry in september
he was stationed in san francisco from through and he took out a patent for the cable car railway that still runs there receiving a charter for its operation but signing away his rights when he was reassigned
in he commanded the th us infantry an all african american regiment with headquarters at fort mckavett texas
he retired in
in the s he was listed in the new york business directory as a lawyer
doubleday spent much of his time writing
he published two important works on the civil war reminiscences of forts sumter and moultrie and chancellorsville and gettysburg the latter being a volume of the series campaigns of the civil war
in the summer of doubleday lived in mendham township new jersey and became a prominent member of the theosophical society
when two of the founders of that society helena blavatsky and henry steel olcott moved to india at the end of that year he was constituted as the president of the american body
doubleday died of heart disease in mendham township on january
doubledays body was laid in state in new yorks city hall and then was taken to washington by train from mendham and was buried in arlington national cemetery in arlington county virginia
he was survived by his wife
although doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important civil war battles he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball in elihu phinneys cow pasture in cooperstown new york in
the mills commission chaired by abraham g
mills the fourth president of the national league was appointed in to determine the origin of baseball
the committees final report on december stated in part that the first scheme for playing baseball according to the best evidence obtainable to date was devised by abner doubleday at cooperstown new york in
it concluded by saying in the years to come in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball and the millions who will be abner doubledays fame will rest evenly if not quite as much upon the fact that he was its inventor
as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the federal army
however there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim
baseball historian george b
kirsch has described the results of the mills commission as a myth
he wrote robert henderson harold seymour and other scholars have since debunked the doubleday cooperstown myth which nonetheless remains powerful in the american imagination because of the efforts of major league baseball and the hall of fame in cooperstown
at his death doubleday left many letters and papers none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game and his new york times obituary did not mention the game at all
chairman mills himself who had been a civil war colleague of doubleday and a member of the honor guard for doubledays body as it lay in state in new york city never recalled hearing doubleday describe his role as the inventor
doubleday was a cadet at west point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from cooperstown the prior year
furthermore the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to doubleday was that of abner graves whose credibility is questionable a few years later he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life
part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in cooperstown in
despite the lack of solid evidence linking doubleday to the origins of baseball cooperstown new york became the new home of what is today the national baseball hall of fame and museum in
there may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and abner doubleday
while the modern rules of baseball were formulated in new york during the s it was the scattering of new yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country that spread not only baseball but also the new york rules thereby harmonizing the rules and being a catalyst for its growth
doubleday was a high ranking officer whose duties included seeing to provisions for the us army fighting throughout the south and border states
for the morale of the men he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men
there is a monument to doubleday at gettysburg erected by his men admirers and the state of new york
there is a obelisk monument at arlington national cemetery where he is buried
doubleday field is a seat baseball stadium named for abner doubleday located in cooperstown new york near the baseball hall of fame
it hosted the annual hall of fame game an exhibition game between two major league teams that was played from until
it has hosted the hall of fame classic since
the auburn doubledays are a collegiate summer baseball team based in doubledays hometown of auburn new york
doubleday field at the united states military academy at west point new york where the army black knights play at johnson stadium is named in doubledays honor
the abner doubleday little league and babe ruth fields in ballston spa new york the town of his birth
the house of his birth still stands in the middle of town and there is a monument to him on front street
a sign at the doubleday hill monument erected in williamsport maryland to commemorate doubledays occupation of a hill there during the civil war claims he invented the game in
mendham borough and mendham township new jersey has held a municipal holiday known as abner doubleday day for numerous years in the generals honor and commissioned a plaque near the site of his home in the borough in even though the borough was known as mendham township back then
in the abner doubleday society erected a monument to doubleday in iron spring park ballston spa near his birthplace
in the movie the ridiculous doubleday is portrayed by john turturro
the character organizes the first game of baseball between the six main characters and a group of chinese immigrants creating the rules as he goes primarily to allow him to win
in the rd episode of the anime samurai champloo titled baseball blues doubleday and alexander cartwright are featured as american naval officers who engage the main characters and local japanese people into a baseball game which the americans lose
in the mini series north and south george hazzard is seen watching a primitive form of baseball with a wounded orry main while referring to the game being invented by doubleday a fellow west point cadet
americas national game is a book by albert spalding published in that details the early history of the sport of baseball
it is one of the defining books in the early formative years of modern baseball
much of the story is told first hand since the s spalding had been involved in the game first as a pitcher and later a manager and club owner
later he branched out to become a leading manufacturer of sporting goods
in addition to his personal recollections he had access to the records of henry chadwick the games first statistician and archivist
much of his early history of the game is considered to be reliable
spalding was however said to aggrandize his role in the major moments in baseballs history
early editions of the book include quality full page photo plates of important players
amplitude modulation is a modulation technique used in electronic communication most commonly for transmitting messages with a radio wave
in amplitude modulation the amplitude of the wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal such as an audio signal
this technique contrasts with angle modulation in which either the frequency of the carrier wave is varied as in frequency modulation or its phase as in phase modulation
am was the earliest modulation method used for transmitting audio in radio broadcasting
it was developed during the first quarter of the th century beginning with roberto landell de moura and reginald fessendens radiotelephone experiments in
this original form of am is sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation because the standard method produces sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency
single sideband modulation uses bandpass filters to eliminate one of the sidebands and possibly the carrier signal which improves the ratio of message power to total transmission power reduces power handling requirements of line repeaters and permits better bandwidth utilization of the transmission medium
am remains in use in many forms of communication in addition to am broadcasting shortwave radio amateur radio two way radios vhf aircraft radio citizens band radio and in computer modems in the form of qam
in electronics telecommunications and mechanics modulation means varying some aspect of a continuous wave carrier signal with an information bearing modulation waveform such as an audio signal which represents sound or a video signal which represents images
in this sense the carrier wave which has a much higher frequency than the message signal carries the information
at the receiving station the message signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by demodulation
a represents the time varying amplitude of the sinusoidal carrier wave and the cosine term is the carrier at its angular frequency formula and the instantaneous phase deviation formula
this description directly provides the two major groups of modulation amplitude modulation and angle modulation
in angle modulation the term a is constant and the second term of the equation has a functional relationship to the modulating message signal
angle modulation provides two methods of modulation frequency modulation and phase modulation
in amplitude modulation the angle term is held constant and the first term a of the equation has a functional relationship to the modulating message signal
the modulating message signal may be analog in nature or it may be a digital signal in which case the technique is generally called amplitude shift keying
for example in am radio communication a continuous wave radio frequency signal has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission
the message signal determines the envelope of the transmitted waveform
in the frequency domain amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the carrier frequency and two adjacent sidebands
each sideband is equal in bandwidth to that of the modulating signal and is a mirror image of the other
standard am is thus sometimes called double sideband amplitude modulation
a disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques not only standard am is that the receiver amplifies and detects noise and electromagnetic interference in equal proportion to the signal
increasing the received signal to noise ratio say by a factor of thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of
this is in contrast to frequency modulation and digital radio where the effect of such noise following demodulation is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception
for this reason am broadcast is not favored for music and high fidelity broadcasting but rather for voice communications and broadcasts
am is also inefficient in power usage at least two thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal
the carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted
however its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands
in some modulation systems based on am a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component however receivers for these signals are more complex because they must provide a precise carrier frequency reference signal from a greatly reduced pilot carrier to use in the demodulation process
even with the carrier totally eliminated in double sideband suppressed carrier transmission carrier regeneration is possible using a costas phase locked loop
this does not work for single sideband suppressed carrier transmission leading to the characteristic donald duck sound from such receivers when slightly detuned
single sideband am is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications because it has power and bandwidth efficiency
on the other hand in medium wave and short wave broadcasting standard am with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers
the broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience
a simple form of digital amplitude modulation which can be used for transmitting binary data is on off keying the simplest form of amplitude shift keying in which ones and zeros are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier
on off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit morse code where it is known as continuous wave operation even though the transmission is not strictly continuous
a more complex form of am quadrature amplitude modulation is now more commonly used with digital data while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth
a simple form of amplitude modulation is the transmission of speech signals from a traditional analog telephone set using a common battery local loop
the direct current provided by the central office battery is a carrier with a frequency of hz
it is modulated by a microphone in the telephone set according to the acoustic signal from the speaker
the result is a varying amplitude direct current whose ac component is the speech signal extracted at the central office for transmission to another subscriber
an additional function provided by the carrier in standard am but which is lost in either single or double sideband suppressed carrier transmission is that it provides an amplitude reference
in the receiver the automatic gain control responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation
on the other hand with suppressed carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation so the agc must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation
this typically involves a so called fast attack slow decay circuit which holds the agc level for a second or more following such peaks in between syllables or short pauses in the program
this is very acceptable for communications radios where compression of the audio aids intelligibility
however it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming where a faithful reproduction of the original program including its varying modulation levels is expected
amplitude modulation was used in experiments of multiplex telegraph and telephone transmission in the late s
however the practical development of this technology is identified with the period between and of radiotelephone transmission that is the effort to send audio signals by radio waves
the first radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy using pulses of the carrier wave to spell out text messages in morse code
they could not transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of damped waves pulses of radio waves that declined to zero and sounded like a buzz in receivers
in effect they were already amplitude modulated
the first am transmission was made by canadian researcher reginald fessenden on december using a spark gap transmitter with a specially designed high frequency khz interrupter over a distance of one mile at cobb island maryland us
his first transmitted words were hello
one two three four
is it snowing where you are mr thiessen
the words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark
fessenden was a significant figure in the development of am radio
he was one of the first researchers to realize from experiments like the above that the existing technology for producing radio waves the spark transmitter was not usable for amplitude modulation and that a new kind of transmitter one that produced sinusoidal continuous waves was needed
this was a radical idea at the time because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves and fessenden was ridiculed
he invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters the alexanderson alternator with which he made what is considered the first am public entertainment broadcast on christmas eve
he also discovered the principle on which am is based heterodyning and invented one of the first detectors able to rectify and receive am the electrolytic detector or liquid baretter in
other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy such as the fleming valve and the crystal detector also proved able to rectify am signals so the technological hurdle was generating am waves receiving them was not a problem
early experiments in am radio transmission conducted by fessenden valdemar poulsen ernst ruhmer quirino majorana charles herrold and lee de forest were hampered by the lack of a technology for amplification
the first practical continuous wave am transmitters were based on either the huge expensive alexanderson alternator developed or versions of the poulsen arc transmitter invented in
the modifications necessary to transmit am were clumsy and resulted in very low quality audio
modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon microphone inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna
the limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones many of the microphones were water cooled
the discovery of the amplifying ability of the audion tube invented in by lee de forest solved these problems
the vacuum tube feedback oscillator invented in by edwin armstrong and alexander meissner was a cheap source of continuous waves and could be easily modulated to make an am transmitter
modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube so the microphone or other audio source didnt have to modulate a high power radio signal
wartime research greatly advanced the art of am modulation and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with am transmission of news or music
the vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of am broadcasting around the first electronic mass communication medium
amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for radio broadcasting until fm broadcasting began after world war ii
at the same time as am radio began telephone companies such as att were developing the other large application for am sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate carrier frequencies called frequency division multiplexing
in john renshaw carson formulated the first mathematical description of amplitude modulation showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device creates a sideband on both sides of the carrier frequency
passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device can extract the original baseband signal
his analysis also showed that only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal and carson patented single sideband modulation on december
this advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by att for longwave transatlantic telephone service beginning january
after ww ii it was developed for military aircraft communication
the carrier wave of frequency fc and amplitude a is expressed by where m is the amplitude sensitivity m is the amplitude of modulation
if m then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal
amplitude modulation results when the carrier c is multiplied by the positive quantity a in this simple case m is identical to the modulation index discussed below
with m the amplitude modulated signal y thus corresponds to the top graph in figure
therefore the modulated signal has three components the carrier wave c which is unchanged in frequency and two sidebands with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency fc
a useful modulation signal m is usually more complex than a single sine wave as treated above
however by the principle of fourier decomposition m can be expressed as the sum of a set of sine waves of various frequencies amplitudes and phases
carrying out the multiplication of m with c as above the result consists of a sum of sine waves
again the carrier c is present unchanged but each frequency component of m at fi has two sidebands at frequencies fc fi and fc fi
the collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband and those below constitute the lower sideband
the modulation m may be considered to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components as shown in the top of figure
one can view the sidebands as that modulation m having simply been shifted in frequency by fc as depicted at the bottom right of figure
the short term spectrum of modulation changing as it would for a human voice for instance the frequency content may be plotted as a function of time as in figure
it can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies an upper sideband is generated according to those frequencies shifted above the carrier frequency and the same content mirror imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency
at all times the carrier itself remains constant and of greater power than the total sideband power
the rf bandwidth of an am transmission is twice the bandwidth of the modulating signal since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency
although the bandwidth of an am signal is narrower than one using frequency modulation it is twice as wide as single sideband techniques it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient
within a frequency band only half as many transmissions can thus be accommodated
for this reason analog television employs a variant of single sideband in order to reduce the required channel spacing
another improvement over standard am is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum
in figure this is the spike in between the sidebands even with full sine wave modulation the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands yet it carries no unique information
thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband or with both sidebands remaining
while these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency
for that reason standard am continues to be widely used especially in broadcast transmission to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection
even television with a suppressed lower sideband includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection
but for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed
a technique used widely in broadcast am transmitters is an application of the hapburg carrier first proposed in the s but impractical with the technology then available
during periods of low modulation the carrier power would be reduced and would return to full power during periods of high modulation levels
this has the effect of reducing the overall power demand of the transmitter and is most effective on speech type programmes
various trade names are used for its implementation by the transmitter manufacturers from the late s onwards
the am modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the rf signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier
it is thus defined as where formula and formula are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude respectively the modulation amplitude is the peak change in the rf amplitude from its unmodulated value
modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage and may be displayed on a meter connected to an am transmitter
so if formula carrier amplitude varies by above its unmodulated level as is shown in the first waveform below
for formula it varies by as shown in the illustration below it
with modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero and this represents full modulation using standard am and is often a target but mustnt be exceeded
increasing the modulating signal beyond that point known as overmodulation causes a standard am modulator to fail as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero resulting in distortion of the received modulation
transmitters typically incorporate a limiter circuit to avoid overmodulation and or a compressor circuit in order to still approach modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise
such circuits are sometimes referred to as a vogad
however it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding without introducing distortion in the case of double sideband reduced carrier transmission
in that case negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase as shown in the third waveform below
this cannot be produced using the efficient high level modulation techniques which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters
rather a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a linear amplifier
whats more a standard am receiver using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal
rather synchronous detection is required
thus double sideband transmission is generally not referred to as am even though it generates an identical rf waveform as standard am as long as the modulation index is below
such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands to the point of double sideband suppressed carrier transmission where the carrier is reduced to zero
in all such cases the term modulation index loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small remaining carrier amplitude
modulation circuit designs may be classified as low or high level
in modern radio systems modulated signals are generated via digital signal processing
with dsp many types of am are possible with software control
calculated digital samples are converted to voltages with a digital to analog converter typically at a frequency less than the desired rf output frequency
the analog signal must then be shifted in frequency and linearly amplified to the desired frequency and power level
this low level method for am is used in many amateur radio transceivers
am may also be generated at a low level using analog methods described in the next section
high power am transmitters are based on high efficiency class d and class e power amplifier stages modulated by varying the supply voltage
older designs also generate am by controlling the gain of the transmitters final amplifier
the following types are for vacuum tube transmitters the simplest form of am demodulator consists of a diode which is configured to act as envelope detector
another type of demodulator the product detector can provide better quality demodulation with additional circuit complexity
augustin jean fresnel was a french civil engineer and physicist whose research in optics led to the almost unanimous acceptance of the wave theory of light excluding any remnant of newtons corpuscular theory from the late s until the end of the th century
he is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of stepped lenses to extend the visibility of lighthouses saving countless lives at sea
the simpler dioptric stepped lens first proposed by count buffon and independently reinvented by fresnel is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors
by expressing huygenss principle of secondary waves and youngs principle of interference in quantitative terms and supposing that simple colors consist of sinusoidal waves fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of diffraction by straight edges including the first satisfactory wave based explanation of rectilinear propagation
part of his argument was a proof that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions
by further supposing that light waves are purely transverse fresnel explained the nature of polarization the mechanism of chromatic polarization and the transmission and reflection coefficients at the interface between two transparent isotropic media
then by generalizing the direction speed polarization relation for calcite he accounted for the directions and polarizations of the refracted rays in doubly refractive crystals of the biaxial class
the period between the first publication of his pure transverse wave hypothesis and the submission of his first correct solution to the biaxial problem was less than a year
later he coined the terms linear polarization circular polarization and elliptical polarization explained how optical rotation could be understood as a difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization and accounted for the change in polarization due to total internal reflection as exploited in the fresnel rhomb
defenders of the established corpuscular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions
fresnel had a lifelong battle with tuberculosis to which he succumbed at the age of
although he did not become a public celebrity in his lifetime he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers including the rumford medal of the royal society of london and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves
after the wave theory of light was subsumed by maxwells electromagnetic theory in the s some attention was diverted from the magnitude of fresnels contribution
in the period between fresnels unification of physical optics and maxwells wider unification a contemporary authority humphrey lloyd described fresnels transverse wave theory as the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science newtons system of the universe alone excepted
augustin jean fresnel born in broglie normandy on may was the second of four sons of the architect jacques fresnel and his wife augustine ne mrime
in following the revolution broglie became part of the dpartement of eure
the family moved twice in to cherbourg and in to jacquess home town of mathieu where madame fresnel would spend years as a widow outliving two of her sons
the first son louis was admitted to the cole polytechnique became a lieutenant in the artillery and was killed in action at jaca spain the day before his rd birthday
the third lonor followed augustin into civil engineering succeeded him as secretary of the lighthouse commission and helped to edit his collected works
the fourth fulgence fresnel became a noted linguist diplomat and orientalist and occasionally assisted augustin with negotiations
fulgence died in bagdad in having led a mission to explore babylon
lonor apparently was the only one of the four who married
their mothers younger brother jean franois lonor mrime father of the writer prosper mrime was a paint artist who turned his attention to the chemistry of painting
he became the permanent secretary of the cole des beaux arts and a professor at the cole polytechnique and was the initial point of contact between augustin and the leading optical physicists of the day
the fresnel brothers were initially home schooled by their mother
the sickly augustin was considered the slow one not inclined to memorization but the popular story that he hardly began to read until the age of eight is disputed
at the age of nine or ten he was undistinguished except for his ability to turn tree branches into toy bows and guns that worked far too well earning himself the title lhomme de gnie from his accomplices and a united crackdown from their elders
in augustin was sent to the cole centrale at caen as company for louis
but augustin lifted his performance in late he was accepted into the cole polytechnique being placed th in the entrance examination
as the detailed records of the cole polytechnique begin in we know little of augustins time there except that he made few if any friends and in spite of continuing poor health excelled in drawing and geometry in his first year he took a prize for his solution to a geometry problem posed by adrien marie legendre
graduating in he then enrolled at the cole nationale des ponts et chausses from which he graduated in entering the service of the corps des ponts et chausses as an ingnieur ordinaire aspirant
directly or indirectly he was to remain in the employment of the corps des ponts for the rest of his life
fresnels parents were roman catholics of the jansenist sect characterized by an extreme augustinian view of original sin
religion took first place in the boys home schooling
in his mother said augustin remained a jansenist
he regarded his intellectual talents as gifts from god and considered it his duty to use them for the benefit of others
according to his fellow engineer alphonse duleau who helped to nurse him through his final illness fresnel saw the study of nature as part of the study of the power and goodness of god
he placed virtue above science and genius
in his last days he prayed for strength of soul not against death alone but against the interruption of discoveries of which he hoped to derive useful applications
jansenism is considered heretical by the roman catholic church and grattan guinness suggests this is why fresnel never gained a permanent academic teaching post his only teaching appointment was at the athne in the winter of
the article on fresnel in the catholic encyclopedia does not mention his jansenism but describes him as a deeply religious man and remarkable for his keen sense of duty
fresnel was initially posted to the western dpartement of vende
there in he anticipated what became known as the solvay process for producing soda ash except that recycling of the ammonia was not considered
that difference may explain why leading chemists who learned of his discovery through his uncle lonor eventually thought it uneconomic
about fresnel was sent to nyons in the southern dpartement of drme to assist with the imperial highway that was to connect spain and italy
it is from nyons that we have the first evidence of his interest in optics
on may while work was slack due to napoleons defeat fresnel wrote a ps to his brother lonor saying in part as late as december he was still waiting for information but he had received biots memoir by february
in march perceiving napoleons return from elba as an attack on civilization fresnel departed without leave hastened to toulouse and offered his services to the royalist resistance but soon found himself on the sick list
returning to nyons in defeat he was threatened and had his windows broken
during the hundred days he was placed on suspension which he was eventually allowed to spend at his mothers house in mathieu
there he used his enforced leisure to begin his optical experiments
the appreciation of fresnels reconstruction of physical optics might be assisted by an overview of the fragmented state in which he found the subject
in this subsection optical phenomena that were unexplained or whose explanations were disputed are named in bold type
the corpuscular theory of light favored by isaac newton and accepted by nearly all of fresnels seniors easily explained rectilinear propagation the corpuscles obviously moved very fast so that their paths were very nearly straight
the wave theory as developed by christiaan huygens in his treatise on light explained rectilinear propagation on the assumption that each point crossed by a traveling wavefront becomes the source of a secondary wavefront
given the initial position of a traveling wavefront any later position was the common tangent surface of the secondary wavefronts emitted from the earlier position
as the extent of the common tangent was limited by the extent of the initial wavefront the repeated application of huygenss construction to a plane wavefront of limited extent gave a straight parallel beam
while this construction indeed predicted rectilinear propagation it was difficult to reconcile with the common observation that wavefronts on the surface of water can bend around obstructions and with the similar behavior of sound waves causing newton to maintain to the end of his life that if light consisted of waves it would bend and spread every way into the shadows
huygenss theory neatly explained the law of ordinary reflection and the law of ordinary refraction provided that the secondary waves traveled slower in denser media
the corpuscular theory with the hypothesis that the corpuscles were subject to forces acting perpendicular to surfaces explained the same laws equally well albeit with the implication that light traveled faster in denser media that implication was wrong but could not be directly disproven with the technology of newtons time or even fresnels time
similarly inconclusive was stellar aberration that is the apparent change in the position of a star due to the velocity of the earth across the line of sight
identified by james bradley in stellar aberration was widely taken as confirmation of the corpuscular theory
but it was equally compatible with the wave theory as euler noted in tacitly assuming that the aether near the earth was not disturbed by the motion of the earth
the outstanding strength of huygenss theory was his explanation of the birefringence of iceland crystal on the assumption that the secondary waves are spherical for the ordinary refraction and spheroidal for the extraordinary refraction
in general huygenss common tangent construction implies that rays are paths of least time between successive positions of the wavefront in accordance with fermats principle
in the special case of isotropic media the secondary wavefronts must be spherical and huygenss construction then implies that the rays are perpendicular to the wavefront indeed the law of ordinary refraction can be separately derived from that premise as ignace gaston pardies did before huygens
although newton rejected the wave theory he noticed its potential to explain colors including the colors of thin plates on the assumption that light consists of periodic waves with the lowest frequencies at the red end of the spectrum and the highest frequencies at the violet end
in he published a heavy hint to that effect but contemporary supporters of the wave theory failed to act on it robert hooke treated light as a periodic sequence of pulses but did not use frequency as the criterion of color while huygens treated the waves as individual pulses without any periodicity and pardies died young in
newton himself tried to explain colors of thin plates using the corpuscular theory by supposing that his corpuscles had the wavelike property of alternating between fits of easy transmission and fits of easy reflection the distance between like fits depending on the color and the medium and awkwardly on the angle of refraction or reflection into that medium
more awkwardly still this theory required thin plates to reflect only at the back surface although thick plates manifestly reflected also at the front surface
it was not until that thomas young in the bakerian lecture for that year cited newtons hint and accounted for the colors of a thin plate as the combined effect of the front and back reflections which reinforce or cancel each other according to the wavelength and the thickness
young similarly explained the colors of striated surfaces as the wavelength dependent reinforcement or cancellation of reflections from adjacent lines
he described this reinforcement or cancellation as interference
neither newton nor huygens satisfactorily explained diffraction the blurring and fringing of shadows where according to rectilinear propagation they ought to be sharp
newton who called diffraction inflexion supposed that rays of light passing close to obstacles were bent but his explanation was only qualitative
huygenss common tangent construction without modifications could not accommodate diffraction at all
two such modifications were proposed by young in the same bakerian lecture first that the secondary waves near the edge of an obstacle could diverge into the shadow but only weakly due to limited reinforcement from other secondary waves and second that diffraction by an edge was caused by interference between two rays one reflected off the edge and the other inflected while passing near the edge
the latter ray would be undeviated if sufficiently far from the edge but young did not elaborate on that case
these were the earliest suggestions that the degree of diffraction depends on wavelength
later in the bakerian lecture young ceased to regard inflection as a separate phenomenon and produced evidence that diffraction fringes inside the shadow of a narrow obstacle were due to interference when the light from one side was blocked the internal fringes disappeared
but young was alone in such efforts until fresnel entered the field
huygens in his investigation of double refraction noticed something that he could not explain when light passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second but when the second crystal is rotated about the incident rays the roles are interchanged so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second and vice versa
this discovery gave newton another reason to reject the wave theory rays of light evidently had sides
corpuscles could have sides but waves of light could not because any such waves would need to be longitudinal
newton offered an alternative rule for the extraordinary refraction which rode on his authority through the th century although he made no known attempt to deduce it from any principles of optics corpuscular or otherwise
in the extraordinary refraction of calcite was investigated experimentally with unprecedented accuracy by tienne louis malus and found to be consistent with huygenss spheroid construction not newtons rule
malus encouraged by pierre simon laplace then sought to explain this law in corpuscular terms from the known relation between the incident and refracted ray directions malus derived the corpuscular velocity that would satisfy maupertuiss least action principle
but as young pointed out the existence of such a velocity law was guaranteed by huygenss spheroid because huygenss construction leads to fermats principle which becomes maupertuiss principle if the ray speed is replaced by the reciprocal of the particle speed the corpuscularists had not found a force law that would yield the alleged velocity law except by a circular argument in which a force acting at the surface of the crystal inexplicably depended on the direction of the velocity within the crystal
worse it was doubtful that any such force would satisfy the conditions of maupertuiss principle
in contrast young proceeded to show that a medium more easily compressible in one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it as if it consisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connected by a substance somewhat less elastic admits spheroidal longitudinal wavefronts as huygens supposed
but malus in the midst of his experiments on double refraction noticed something else when a ray of light is reflected off a non metallic surface at the appropriate angle it behaves like one of the two rays emerging from a calcite crystal
it was malus who coined the term polarization to describe this behavior although the polarizing angle became known as brewsters angle after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by david brewster in
malus also introduced the term plane of polarization
in the case of polarization by reflection his plane of polarization was the plane of the incident and reflected rays in modern terms this is the plane normal to the electric vibration
in malus further discovered that the intensity of light passing through two polarizers is proportional to the squared cosine of the angle between their planes of polarization whether the polarizers work by reflection or double refraction and that all birefringent crystals produce both extraordinary refraction and polarization
as the corpuscularists started trying to explain these things in terms of polar molecules of light the wave theorists had no working hypothesis on the nature of polarization prompting young to remark that maluss observations present greater difficulties to the advocates of the undulatory theory than any other facts with which we are acquainted
malus died in february at the age of shortly after receiving the rumford medal for his work on polarization
in august franois arago reported that if a thin plate of mica was viewed against a white polarized backlight through a calcite crystal the two images of the mica were of complementary colors
the light emerging from the mica was depolarized in the sense that there was no orientation of the calcite that made one image disappear yet it was not ordinary light for which the two images would be of the same color
rotating the calcite around the line of sight changed the colors though they remained complementary
rotating the mica changed the saturation of the colors
this phenomenon became known as chromatic polarization
replacing the mica with a much thicker plate of quartz with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis produced a similar effect except that rotating the quartz made no difference
arago tried to explain his observations in corpuscular terms
in as arago pursued further qualitative experiments and other commitments jean baptiste biot reworked the same ground using a gypsum lamina in place of the mica and found empirical formulae for the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images
the formulae contained two coefficients supposedly representing colors of rays affected and unaffected by the plate the affected rays being of the same color mix as those reflected by amorphous thin plates of proportional but lesser thickness
arago protested declaring that he had made some of the same discoveries but had not had time to write them up
in fact the overlap between aragos work and biots was minimal aragos being only qualitative and wider in scope
but the dispute triggered a notorious falling out between the two men
later that year biot tried to explain the observations as an oscillation of the alignment of the affected corpuscles at a frequency proportional to that of newtons fits due to forces depending on the alignment
this theory became known as mobile polarization
to reconcile his results with a sinusoidal oscillation biot had to suppose that the corpuscles emerged with one of two permitted orientations namely the extremes of the oscillation with probabilities depending on the phase of the oscillation
corpuscular optics was becoming expensive on assumptions
but in biot reported that the case of quartz was simpler the observable phenomenon was a gradual rotation of the polarization direction with distance and could be explained by a corresponding rotation of the corpuscles
early in reviewing biots work on chromatic polarization young noted that the periodicity of the color as a function of the plate thickness including the factor by which the period exceeded that for a reflective thin plate and even the effect of obliquity of the plate could be explained by the wave theory in terms of the different propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves through the plate
but young was then the only public defender of the wave theory
in summary in the spring of as fresnel tried in vain to guess what polarization was the corpuscularists thought that they knew while the wave theorists literally had no idea
both theories claimed to explain rectilinear propagation but the wave explanation was overwhelmingly regarded as unconvincing
the corpuscular theory could not rigorously link double refraction to surface forces the wave theory could not yet link it to polarization
the corpuscular theory was weak on thin plates and silent on gratings the wave theory was strong on both but under appreciated
concerning diffraction the corpuscular theory did not yield quantitative predictions while the wave theory had begun to do so by considering diffraction as a manifestation of interference but had only considered two rays at a time
only the corpuscular theory gave even a vague insight into brewsters angle maluss law or optical rotation
concerning chromatic polarization the wave theory explained the periodicity far better than the corpuscular theory but had nothing to say about the role of polarization and its explanation of the periodicity was largely ignored
and arago had founded the study of chromatic polarization only to lose the lead controversially to biot
such were the circumstances in which arago first heard of fresnels interest in optics
fresnels letters from later in reveal his interest in the wave theory including his awareness that it explained the constancy of the speed of light and was at least compatible with stellar aberration
eventually he compiled what he called his rveries into an essay and submitted it via lonor mrime to andr marie ampre who did not respond directly
but on december mrime dined with ampre and arago with whom he was acquainted through the cole polytechnique and arago promised to look at fresnels essay
in mid on his way home to mathieu to serve his suspension fresnel met arago in paris and spoke of the wave theory and stellar aberration
he was informed that he was trying to break down open doors and directed to classical works on optics
fresnel would not have ready access to these works outside paris and could not read english
but in mathieu with a point source of light made by focusing sunlight with a drop of honey a crude micrometer of his own construction and supporting apparatus made by a local locksmith he began his own experiments
his technique was novel whereas earlier investigators had projected the fringes onto a screen fresnel soon abandoned the screen and observed the fringes in space through a lens with the micrometer at its focus allowing more accurate measurements while requiring less light
later in july after napoleons final defeat fresnel was reinstated with the advantage of having backed the winning side
he requested a two month leave of absence which was readily granted because roadworks were in abeyance
on september he wrote to arago beginning i think i have found the explanation and the law of colored fringes which one notices in the shadows of bodies illuminated by a luminous point
in the same paragraph however fresnel implicitly acknowledged doubt about the novelty of his work noting that he would need to incur some expense in order to improve his measurements he wanted to know whether this is not useless and whether the law of diffraction has not already been established by sufficiently exact experiments
he explained that he had not yet had a chance to acquire the items on his reading lists with the apparent exception of youngs book which he could not understand without his brothers help
not surprisingly he had retraced many of youngs steps
in a memoir sent to the institute on october fresnel mapped the external and internal fringes in the shadow of a wire
he noticed like young before him that the internal fringes disappeared when the light from one side was blocked and concluded that the vibrations of two rays that cross each other under a very small angle can contradict each other but whereas young took the disappearance of the internal fringes as confirmation of the principle of interference fresnel reported that it was the internal fringes that first drew his attention to the principle
to explain the diffraction pattern fresnel constructed the internal fringes by considering the intersections of circular wavefronts emitted from the two edges of the obstruction and the external fringes by considering the intersections between direct waves and waves reflected off the nearer edge
for the external fringes to obtain tolerable agreement with observation he had to suppose that the reflected wave was inverted and he noted that the predicted paths of the fringes were hyperbolic
in the part of the memoir that most clearly surpassed young fresnel explained the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction in terms of interference noting that if two parallel rays were reflected or refracted at other than the prescribed angle they would no longer have the same phase in a common perpendicular plane and every vibration would be cancelled by a nearby vibration
he noted that his explanation was valid provided that the surface irregularities were much smaller than the wavelength
on november fresnel sent a supplementary note dealing with newtons rings and with gratings including for the first time transmission gratings although in that case the interfering rays were still assumed to be inflected and the experimental verification was inadequate because it used only two threads
as fresnel was not a member of the institute the fate of his memoir depended heavily on the report of a single member
the reporter for fresnels memoir turned out to be arago
on november arago wrote to fresnel fresnel was troubled wanting to know more precisely where he had collided with young
concerning the curved paths of the colored bands young had noted the hyperbolic paths of the fringes in the two source interference pattern corresponding roughly to fresnels internal fringes and had described the hyperbolic fringes that appear on the screen within rectangular shadows
he had not mentioned the curved paths of the external fringes of a shadow but as he later explained that was because newton had already done so
newton evidently thought the fringes were caustics
thus arago erred in his belief that the curved paths of the fringes were fundamentally incompatible with the corpuscular theory
aragos letter went on to request more data on the external fringes
fresnel complied until he exhausted his leave and was assigned to rennes in the dpartement of ille et vilaine
at this point arago interceded with gaspard de prony head of the cole des ponts who wrote to louis mathieu mol head of the corps des ponts suggesting that the progress of science and the prestige of the corps would be enhanced if fresnel could come to paris for a time
he arrived in march and his leave was subsequently extended through the middle of the year
meanwhile in an experiment reported on february arago verified fresnels prediction that the internal fringes were shifted if the rays on one side of the obstacle passed through a thin glass lamina
fresnel correctly attributed this phenomenon to the lower wave velocity in the glass
arago later used a similar argument to explain the colors in the scintillation of stars
fresnels updated memoir was eventually published in the march issue of annales de chimie et de physique of which arago had recently become co editor
that issue did not actually appear until may
in march fresnel already had competition biot read a memoir on diffraction by himself and his student claude pouillet containing copious data and arguing that the regularity of diffraction fringes like the regularity of newtons rings must be linked to newtons fits
but the new link was not rigorous and pouillet himself would become a distinguished early adopter of the wave theory
on may fresnel wrote to young acknowledging how little of his own memoir was new
but in a supplement signed on july and read the next day fresnel noted that the internal fringes were more accurately predicted by supposing that the two interfering rays came from some distance outside the edges of the obstacle
to explain this he divided the incident wavefront at the obstacle into what we now call fresnel zones such that the secondary waves from each zone were spread over half a cycle when they arrived at the observation point
the zones on one side of the obstacle largely canceled out in pairs except the first zone which was represented by an efficacious ray
this approach worked for the internal fringes but the superposition of the efficacious ray and the direct ray did not work for the external fringes
the contribution from the efficacious ray was thought to be only partly canceled for reasons involving the dynamics of the medium where the wavefront was continuous symmetry forbade oblique vibrations but near the obstacle that truncated the wavefront the asymmetry allowed some sideways vibration towards the geometric shadow
this argument showed that fresnel had not fully accepted huygenss principle which would have permitted oblique radiation from all portions of the front
in the same supplement fresnel described his well known double mirror comprising two flat mirrors joined at an angle of slightly less than with which he produced a two slit interference pattern from two virtual images of the same slit
a conventional double slit experiment required a preliminary single slit to ensure that the light falling on the double slit was coherent
in fresnels version the preliminary single slit was retained and the double slit was replaced by the double mirror which bore no physical resemblance to the double slit and yet performed the same function
this result made it hard to believe that the two slit pattern had anything to do with corpuscles being deflected as they passed near the edges of the slits
but was the year without a summer crops failed hungry farming families lined the streets of rennes the central government organized charity workhouses for the needy and in october fresnel was sent back to ille et vilaine to supervise charity workers in addition to his regular road crew
according to arago fresnels letters from december reveal his consequent anxiety
to arago he complained of being tormented by the worries of surveillance and the need to reprimand and to mrime he wrote i find nothing more tiresome than having to manage other men and i admit that i have no idea what im doing
on march the acadmie des sciences announced that diffraction would be the topic for the biannual physics grand prix to be awarded in
the deadline for entries was set at august to allow time for replication of experiments
although the wording of the problem referred to rays and inflection and did not invite wave based solutions arago and ampre encouraged fresnel to enter
in the fall of fresnel supported by de prony obtained a leave of absence from the new head of the corp des ponts louis becquey and returned to paris
he resumed his engineering duties in the spring of but from then on he was based in paris first on the canal de lourcq and then with the cadastre of the pavements
on january in a different context fresnel showed that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions
his method was similar to the phasor representation except that the forces were plane vectors rather than complex numbers they could be added and multiplied by scalars but not multiplied and divided by each other
the explanation was algebraic rather than geometric
knowledge of this method was assumed in a preliminary note on diffraction dated april and deposited on april in which fresnel outlined the elementary theory of diffraction as found in modern textbooks
he restated huygenss principle in combination with the superposition principle saying that the vibration at each point on a wavefront is the sum of the vibrations that would be sent to it at that moment by all the elements of the wavefront in any of its previous positions all elements acting separately
for a wavefront partly obstructed in a previous position the summation was to be carried out over the unobstructed portion
in directions other than the normal to the primary wavefront the secondary waves were weakened due to obliquity but weakened much more by destructive interference so that the effect of obliquity alone could be ignored
for diffraction by a straight edge the intensity as a function of distance from the geometric shadow could then be expressed with sufficient accuracy in terms of what are now called the normalized fresnel integrals the same note included a table of the integrals for an upper limit ranging from to in steps of computed with a mean error of plus a smaller table of maxima and minima of the resulting intensity
in his final memoir on the diffraction of light deposited on july and bearing the latin epigraph natura simplex et fecunda fresnel slightly expanded the two tables without changing the existing figures except for a correction to the first minimum of intensity
for completeness he repeated his solution to the problem of interference whereby sinusoidal functions are added like vectors
he acknowledged the directionality of the secondary sources and the variation in their distances from the observation point chiefly to explain why these things make negligible difference in the context provided of course that the secondary sources do not radiate in the retrograde direction
then applying his theory of interference to the secondary waves he expressed the intensity of light diffracted by a single straight edge in terms of integrals which involved the dimensions of the problem but which could be converted to the normalized forms above
with reference to the integrals he explained the calculation of the maxima and minima of the intensity and noted that the calculated intensity falls very rapidly as one moves into the geometric shadow
the last result as olivier darrigol says amounts to a proof of the rectilinear propagation of light in the wave theory indeed the first proof that a modern physicist would still accept
for the experimental testing of his calculations fresnel used red light with a wavelength of nm which he deduced from the diffraction pattern in the simple case in which light incident on a single slit was focused by a cylindrical lens
for a variety of distances from the source to the obstacle and from the obstacle to the field point he compared the calculated and observed positions of the fringes for diffraction by a half plane a slit and a narrow strip concentrating on the minima which were visually sharper than the maxima
for the slit and the strip he could not use the previously computed table of maxima and minima for each combination of dimensions the intensity had to be expressed in terms of sums or differences of fresnel integrals and calculated from the table of integrals and the extrema had to be calculated anew
the agreement between calculation and measurement was better than in almost every case
near the end of the memoir fresnel summed up the difference between huygenss use of secondary waves and his own whereas huygens says there is light only where the secondary waves exactly agree fresnel says there is complete darkness only where the secondary waves exactly cancel out
the judging committee comprised laplace biot and poisson gay lussac and arago who eventually wrote the committees report
although entries in the competition were supposed to be anonymous to the judges fresnels must have been recognizable by the content
there was only one other entry of which neither the manuscript nor any record of the author has survived
that entry was mentioned only in the last paragraph of the judges report noting that the author had shown ignorance of the relevant earlier works of young and fresnel used insufficiently precise methods of observation overlooked known phenomena and made obvious errors
in the words of john worrall the competition facing fresnel could hardly have been less stiff
we may infer that the committee had only two options award the prize to fresnel or withhold it
the committee deliberated into the new year
then poisson exploiting a case in which fresnels theory gave easy integrals predicted that if a circular obstacle were illuminated by a point source there should be a bright spot in the center of the shadow illuminated as brightly as the exterior
this seems to have been intended as a reductio ad absurdum
arago undeterred assembled an experiment with an obstacle mm in diameter and there in the center of the shadow was poissons spot
the unanimous report of the committee read at the meeting of the acadmie on march awarded the prize to the memoir marked no
and bearing as epigraph natura simplex et fecunda
at the same meeting after the judgment was delivered the president of the acadmie opened a sealed note accompanying the memoir revealing the author as fresnel
the award was announced at the public meeting of the acadmie a week later on march
aragos verification of poissons counter intuitive prediction passed into folklore as if it had decided the prize
that view however is not supported by the judges report which gave the matter only two sentences in the penultimate paragraph
neither did fresnels triumph immediately convert laplace biot and poisson to the wave theory for at least four reasons
first although the professionalization of science in france had established common standards it was one thing to acknowledge a piece of research as meeting those standards and another thing to regard it as conclusive
second it was possible to interpret fresnels integrals as rules for combining rays
arago even encouraged that interpretation presumably in order to minimize resistance to fresnels ideas
even biot began teaching the huygens fresnel principle without committing himself to a wave basis
third fresnels theory did not adequately explain the mechanism of generation of secondary waves or why they had any significant angular spread this issue particularly bothered poisson
fourth the question that most exercised optical physicists at that time was not diffraction but polarization on which fresnel had been working but was yet to make his critical breakthrough
an emission theory of light was one that regarded the propagation of light as the transport of some kind of matter
while the corpuscular theory was obviously an emission theory the converse did not follow in principle one could be an emissionist without being a corpuscularist
this was convenient because beyond the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction emissionists never managed to make testable quantitative predictions from a theory of forces acting on corpuscles of light
but they did make quantitative predictions from the premises that rays were countable objects which were conserved in their interactions with matter and which had particular orientations with respect to their directions of propagation
according to this framework polarization and the related phenomena of double refraction and partial reflection involved altering the orientations of the rays and or selecting them according to orientation and the state of polarization of a beam was a question of how many rays were in what orientations in a fully polarized beam the orientations were all the same
this approach which jed buchwald has called selectionism was pioneered by malus and diligently pursued by biot
fresnel in contrast decided to introduce polarization into interference experiments
in july or august fresnel discovered that when a birefringent crystal produced two images of a single slit he could not obtain the usual two slit interference pattern even if he compensated for the different propagation times
a more general experiment suggested by arago found that if the two beams of a double slit device were separately polarized the interference pattern appeared and disappeared as the polarization of one beam was rotated giving full interference for parallel polarizations but no interference for perpendicular polarizations
these experiments among others were eventually reported in a brief memoir published in and later translated into english
in a memoir drafted on august and revised on october fresnel reported an experiment in which he placed two matching thin laminae in a double slit apparatus one over each slit with their optic axes perpendicular and obtained two interference patterns offset in opposite directions with perpendicular polarizations
this in combination with the previous findings meant that each lamina split the incident light into perpendicularly polarized components with different velocities just like a normal birefringent crystal and contrary to biots mobile polarization hypothesis
accordingly in the same memoir fresnel offered his first attempt at a wave theory of chromatic polarization
when polarized light passed through a crystal lamina it was split into ordinary and extraordinary waves and these were perpendicularly polarized and therefore did not interfere so that no colors were produced
but if they then passed through an analyzer their polarizations were brought into alignment and they would interfere
this explanation by itself predicts that if the analyzer is rotated the ordinary and extraordinary waves simply switch roles so that if the analyzer takes the form of a calcite crystal the two images of the lamina should be of the same hue
but in fact as arago and biot had found they are of complementary colors
to correct the prediction fresnel proposed a phase inversion rule whereby one of the constituent waves of one of the two images suffered an additional phase shift on its way through the lamina
this inversion was a weakness in the theory relative to biots as fresnel acknowledged although the rule specified which of the two images had the inverted wave
moreover fresnel could deal only with special cases because he had not yet solved the problem of superposing sinusoidal functions with arbitrary phase differences due to propagation at different velocities through the lamina
he solved that problem in a supplement signed on january
in the same document he accommodated maluss law by proposing an underlying law that if polarized light is incident on a birefringent crystal with its optic axis at an angle to the plane of polarization the ordinary and extraordinary vibrations are scaled by the factors cos and sin respectively
although modern readers easily interpret these factors in terms of perpendicular components of a transverse oscillation fresnel did not explain them that way
hence he still needed the phase inversion rule
he applied all these principles to a case of chromatic polarization not covered by biots formulae involving two successive laminae with axes separated by and obtained predictions that disagreed with biots experiments but agreed with his own
fresnel applied the same principles to the standard case of chromatic polarization in which one birefringent lamina was sliced parallel to its axis and placed between a polarizer and an analyzer
if the analyzer took the form of a thick calcite crystal with its axis in the plane of polarization fresnel predicted that the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the lamina were respectively proportional to where formula is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the optic axis of the lamina formula is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the plane of polarization of the final ordinary image and formula is the phase lag of the extraordinary wave relative to the ordinary wave due to the difference in propagation times through the lamina
the terms in formula are the frequency dependent terms and explain why the lamina must be thin in order to produce discernible colors if the lamina is too thick formula will pass through too many cycles as the frequency varies through the visible range and the eye will not be able to resolve the cycles
from these equations it is easily verified that formula for all formula so that the colors are complementary
without the phase inversion rule there would be a plus sign in front of the last term in the second equation so that the formula dependent term would be the same in both equations implying that the colors were of the same hue
these equations were included in an undated note that fresnel gave to biot to which biot added a few lines of his own
if we substitute then fresnels formulae can be rewritten as which are none other than biots empirical formulae of except that biot interpreted formula and formula as the unaffected and affected selections of the rays incident on the lamina
if biots substitutions were accurate they would imply that his experimental results were more fully explained by fresnels theory than by his own
arago delayed reporting on fresnels works on chromatic polarization until june when he used them in a broad attack on biots theory
in his written response biot protested that aragos attack went beyond the proper scope of a report on the nominated works of fresnel
but biot also claimed that the substitutions for formula and formula and therefore fresnels expressions for formula and formula were empirically wrong because when fresnels intensities of spectral colors were mixed according to newtons rules the squared cosine and sine functions varied too smoothly to account for the observed sequence of colors
that claim drew a written reply from fresnel who disputed whether the colors changed as abruptly as biot claimed and whether the human eye could judge color with sufficient objectivity for the purpose
on the latter question fresnel pointed out that different observers may give different names to the same color
furthermore he said a single observer can only compare colors side by side and even if they are judged to be the same the identity is of sensation not necessarily of composition
fresnels oldest and strongest point that thin crystals were subject to the same laws as thick ones and did not need or allow a separate theory biot left unanswered
arago and fresnel were seen to have won the debate
moreover by this time fresnel had a new simpler explanation of his equations on chromatic polarization
in the draft memoir of august fresnel mentioned two hypotheses one of which he attributed to ampre by which the non interference of orthogonally polarized beams could be explained if polarized light waves were partly transverse
but fresnel could not develop either of these ideas into a comprehensive theory
as early as september according to his later account he realized that the non interference of orthogonally polarized beams together with the phase inversion rule in chromatic polarization would be most easily explained if the waves were purely transverse and ampre had the same thought on the phase inversion rule
but that would raise a new difficulty as natural light seemed to be unpolarized and its waves were therefore presumed to be longitudinal one would need to explain how the longitudinal component of vibration disappeared on polarization and why it did not reappear when polarized light was reflected or refracted obliquely by a glass plate
independently on january young wrote to arago noting that a transverse vibration would constitute a polarization and that if two longitudinal waves crossed at a significant angle they could not cancel without leaving a residual transverse vibration
young repeated this idea in an article published in a supplement to the encyclopdia britannica in february in which he added that maluss law would be explained if polarization consisted in a transverse motion
thus fresnel by his own testimony may not have been the first person to suspect that light waves could have a transverse component or that polarized waves were exclusively transverse
and it was young not fresnel who first published the idea that polarization depends on the orientation of a transverse vibration
but these incomplete theories had not reconciled the nature of polarization with the apparent existence of unpolarized light that achievement was to be fresnels alone
in a note that buchwald dates in the summer of fresnel entertained the idea that unpolarized waves could have vibrations of the same energy and obliquity with their orientations distributed uniformly about the wave normal and that the degree of polarization was the degree of non uniformity in the distribution
two pages later he noted apparently for the first time in writing that his phase inversion rule and the non interference of orthogonally polarized beams would be easily explained if the vibrations of fully polarized waves were perpendicular to the normal to the wave that is purely transverse
but if he could account for lack of polarization by averaging out the transverse component he did not also need to assume a longitudinal component
it was enough to suppose that light waves are purely transverse hence always polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation and that the unpolarized state of natural or direct light is due to rapid and random variations in that orientation in which case two coherent portions of unpolarized light will still interfere because their orientations will be synchronized
it is not known exactly when fresnel made this last step because there is no relevant documentation from or early
but he first published the idea in a paper on calcul des teintes serialized in aragos annales for may june and july
in the first installment fresnel described direct light as the rapid succession of systems of waves polarized in all directions and gave what is essentially the modern explanation of chromatic polarization albeit in terms of the analogy between polarization and the resolution of forces in a plane mentioning transverse waves only in a footnote
the introduction of transverse waves into the main argument was delayed to the second installment in which he revealed the suspicion that he and ampre had harbored since and the difficulty it raised
he continued according to this new view he wrote the act of polarization consists not in creating these transverse movements but in decomposing them into two fixed perpendicular directions and in separating the two components
while selectionists could insist on interpreting fresnels diffraction integrals in terms of discrete countable rays they could not do the same with his theory of polarization
for a selectionist the state of polarization of a beam concerned the distribution of orientations over the population of rays and that distribution was presumed to be static
for fresnel the state of polarization of a beam concerned the variation of a displacement over time
that displacement might be constrained but was not static and rays were geometric constructions not countable objects
the conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had become unbridgeable
the other difficulty posed by pure transverse waves of course was the apparent implication that the aether was an elastic solid except that unlike other elastic solids it was incapable of transmitting longitudinal waves
the wave theory was cheap on assumptions but its latest assumption was expensive on credulity
if that assumption was to be widely entertained its explanatory power would need to be impressive
in the second installment of calcul des teintes fresnel supposed by analogy with sound waves that the density of the aether in a refractive medium was inversely proportional to the square of the wave velocity and therefore directly proportional to the square of the refractive index
for reflection and refraction at the surface between two isotropic media of different indices fresnel decomposed the transverse vibrations into two perpendicular components now known as the s and p components which are parallel to the surface and the plane of incidence respectively in other words the s and p components are respectively square and parallel to the plane of incidence
for the s component fresnel supposed that the interaction between the two media was analogous to an elastic collision and obtained a formula for what we now call the reflectivity the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity
the predicted reflectivity was non zero at all angles
the third installment was a short postscript in which fresnel announced that he had found by a mechanical solution a formula for the reflectivity of the p component which predicted that the reflectivity was zero at the brewster angle
so polarization by reflection had been accounted for but with the proviso that the direction of vibration in fresnels model was perpendicular to the plane of polarization as defined by malus
the technology of the time did not allow the s and p reflectivities to be measured accurately enough to test fresnels formulae at arbitrary angles of incidence
but the formulae could be rewritten in terms of what we now call the reflection coefficient the signed ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude
then if the plane of polarization of the incident ray was at to the plane of incidence the tangent of the corresponding angle for the reflected ray was obtainable from the ratio of the two reflection coefficients and this angle could be measured
fresnel had measured it for a range of angles of incidence for glass and water and the agreement between the calculated and measured angles was better than in all cases
fresnel gave details of the mechanical solution in a memoir read to the acadmie des sciences on january
conservation of energy was combined with continuity of the tangential vibration at the interface
the resulting formulae for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities became known as the fresnel equations
the reflection coefficients for the s and p polarizations are most succinctly expressed as where formula and formula are the angles of incidence and refraction these equations are known respectively as fresnels sine law and fresnels tangent law
by allowing the coefficients to be complex fresnel even accounted for the different phase shifts of the s and p components due to total internal reflection
this success inspired james maccullagh and augustin louis cauchy beginning in to analyze reflection from metals by using the fresnel equations with a complex refractive index
the same technique is applicable to non metallic opaque media
with these generalizations the fresnel equations can predict the appearance of a wide variety of objects under illumination for example in computer graphics
in a memoir dated december fresnel coined the terms linear polarization for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or out of phase circular polarization for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter cycle out of phase and elliptical polarization for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference
he then explained how optical rotation could be understood as a species of birefringence
linearly polarized light could be resolved into two circularly polarized components rotating in opposite directions
if these components propagated at slightly different speeds the phase difference between them and therefore the direction of their linearly polarized resultant would vary continuously with distance
these concepts called for a redefinition of the distinction between polarized and unpolarized light
before fresnel it was thought that polarization could vary in direction and in degree and that it could be a function of color but not that it could vary in kind
hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed by an analyzer with the appropriate orientation
light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization was described as partly or fully depolarized because of its behavior in an analyzer
after fresnel the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of amplitudes and a fixed difference in phase
by that definition elliptically or circularly polarized light is fully polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone
the conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had widened again
by it had been discovered by brewster but not adequately reported that plane polarized light was partly depolarized by total internal reflection if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence
fresnel rediscovered this effect and investigated it by including total internal reflection in a chromatic polarization experiment
with the aid of his first theory of chromatic polarization he found that the apparently depolarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them
choosing an appropriate angle of incidence gave a phase difference of of a cycle
two such reflections from the parallel faces of two coupled prisms gave a phase difference of of a cycle
these findings were contained in a memoir submitted to the acadmie on november and read a fortnight later
an undated marginal note indicates that the two coupled prisms were later replaced by a single parallelepiped in glass now known as a fresnel rhomb
this was the memoir whose supplement dated january contained the method of superposing sinusoidal functions and the restatement of maluss law in terms of amplitudes
in the same supplement fresnel reported his discovery that optical rotation could be emulated by passing the polarized light through a fresnel rhomb followed by an ordinary birefringent lamina sliced parallel to its axis with the axis at to the plane of reflection of the fresnel rhomb followed by a second fresnel rhomb at to the first
in a further memoir read on march fresnel reported that if polarized light was fully depolarized by a fresnel rhomb now described as a parallelepiped its properties were not further modified by a subsequent passage through an optically rotating medium or device
the connection between optical rotation and birefringence was further explained in in the memoir on elliptical and circular polarization
this was followed by the memoir on reflection read in january in which fresnel quantified the phase shifts in total internal reflection and thence calculated the precise angle at which a fresnel rhomb should be cut in order to convert linear polarization to circular polarization
for a refractive index of there were two solutions about and
when light passes through a slice of calcite cut perpendicular to its optic axis the difference between the propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves has a second order dependence on the angle of incidence
if the slice is observed in a highly convergent cone of light that dependence becomes significant so that a chromatic polarization experiment will show a pattern of concentric rings
but most minerals when observed in this manner show a more complicated pattern of rings involving two foci and a lemniscate curve as if they had two optic axes
the two classes of minerals naturally become known as uniaxal and biaxal or in later literature uniaxial and biaxial
in brewster observed the simple concentric pattern in beryl emerald ruby c
the same pattern was later observed in calcite by wollaston biot and seebeck
biot assuming that the concentric pattern was the general case tried to calculate the colors with his theory of chromatic polarization and succeeded better for some minerals than for others
in brewster belatedly explained why seven of the twelve minerals employed by biot had the lemniscate pattern which brewster had observed as early as and the minerals with the more complicated rings also had a more complicated law of refraction
in a uniform crystal according to huygenss theory the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time is the ray velocity surface that is the surface whose distance from the origin in any direction is the ray velocity in that direction
in calcite this surface is two sheeted consisting of a sphere and an oblate spheroid touching each other at opposite points of a common axis touching at the north and south poles if we may use a geographic analogy
but according to maluss corpuscular theory of double refraction the ray velocity was proportional to the reciprocal of that given by huygenss theory in which case the velocity law was of the form where formula and formula were the ordinary and extraordinary ray velocities according to the corpuscular theory and formula was the angle between the ray and the optic axis
by maluss definition the plane of polarization of a ray was the plane of the ray and the optic axis if the ray was ordinary or the perpendicular plane if the ray was extraordinary
in fresnels model the direction of vibration was normal to the plane of polarization
hence for the sphere the vibration was along the lines of latitude and for the spheroid the vibration was along the lines of longitude
on march biot presented a memoir in which he proposed simple generalizations of maluss rules for a crystal with two axes and reported that both generalizations seemed to be confirmed by experiment
for the velocity law the squared sine was replaced by the product of the sines of the angles from the ray to the two axes
and for the polarization of the ordinary ray the plane of the ray and the axis was replaced by the plane bisecting the dihedral angle between the two planes each of which contained the ray and one axis
biots laws meant that a biaxial crystal with axes at a small angle cleaved in the plane of those axes behaved nearly like a uniaxial crystal at near normal incidence this was fortunate because gypsum which had been used in chromatic polarization experiments is biaxial
until fresnel turned his attention to biaxial birefringence it was assumed that one of the two refractions was ordinary even in biaxial crystals
but in a memoir submitted on november fresnel reported two experiments on topaz showing that neither refraction was ordinary in the sense of satisfying snells law that is neither ray was the product of spherical secondary waves
the same memoir contained fresnels first attempt at the biaxial velocity law
for calcite if we interchange the equatorial and polar radii of huygenss oblate spheroid while preserving the polar direction we obtain a prolate spheroid touching the sphere at the equator
a plane through the center origin cuts this prolate spheroid in an ellipse whose major and minor semi axes give the magnitudes of the extraordinary and ordinary ray velocities in the direction normal to the plane and the directions of their respective vibrations
the direction of the optic axis is the normal to the plane for which the ellipse of intersection reduces to a circle
so for the biaxial case fresnel simply replaced the prolate spheroid with a triaxial ellipsoid which was to be sectioned by a plane in the same way
in general there would be two planes passing through the center of the ellipsoid and cutting it in a circle and the normals to these planes would give two optic axes
from the geometry fresnel deduced biots sine law
the ellipsoid indeed gave the correct ray velocities
but it did not give the correct directions of vibration for the biaxial case or even for the uniaxial case because the vibrations in fresnels model were tangential to the wavefront which for an extraordinary ray is not generally normal to the ray
this error was corrected in an extract that fresnel read to the acadmie a week later on november
starting with huygenss spheroid fresnel obtained a th degree surface which when sectioned by a plane as above would yield the wave normal velocities for a wavefront in that plane together with their vibration directions
for the biaxial case he generalized the equation to obtain a surface with three unequal principal dimensions this he subsequently called the surface of elasticity
but he retained the earlier ellipsoid as an approximation from which he deduced biots dihedral law
fresnels initial derivation of the surface of elasticity had been purely geometric and not deductively rigorous
his first attempt at a mechanical derivation contained in a supplement dated january assumed that there were three mutually perpendicular directions in which a displacement produced a reaction in the same direction the reaction was otherwise a linear function of the displacement and the radius of the surface in any direction was the square root of the component in that direction of the reaction to a unit displacement in that direction
the last assumption recognized the requirement that if a wave was to maintain a fixed direction of propagation and a fixed direction of vibration the reaction must not be outside the plane of those two directions
in the same supplement fresnel considered how he might find for the biaxial case the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time that is the surface that reduces to huygenss sphere and spheroid in the uniaxial case
he noted that this wave surface is tangential to all possible plane wavefronts that could have crossed the origin one unit of time ago and he listed the mathematical conditions that it must satisfy
but he doubted the feasibility of deriving the surface from those conditions
in a second supplement fresnel eventually exploited two related facts the wave surface was also the ray velocity surface which could be obtained by sectioning the ellipsoid that he had initially mistaken for the surface of elasticity and the wave surface intersected each plane of symmetry of the ellipsoid in two curves a circle and an ellipse
thus he found that the wave surface is described by the th degree equation where formula and formula are the propagation speeds in directions normal to the coordinate axes for vibrations along the axes
later commentators put the equation in the more compact and memorable form earlier in the second supplement fresnel modeled the medium as an array of point masses and found that the force displacement relation was described by a symmetric matrix confirming the existence of three mutually perpendicular axes on which the displacement produced a parallel force
later in the document he noted that in a biaxial crystal unlike a uniaxial crystal the directions in which there is only one wave normal velocity are not the same as those in which there is only one ray velocity
nowadays we refer to the former directions as the optic axes or binormal axes and the latter as the ray axes or biradial axes
fresnels second supplement was signed on march and submitted the next day less than a year after the publication of his pure transverse wave hypothesis and just less than a year after the demonstration of his prototype eight panel lighthouse lens
having presented the pieces of his theory in roughly the order of discovery fresnel needed to rearrange the material so as to emphasize the mechanical foundations and he still needed a rigorous treatment of biots dihedral law
he attended to these matters in his second memoir on double refraction published in the recueils of the acadmie des sciences for this was not actually printed until late a few months after his death
in this work having established the three perpendicular axes on which a displacement produces a parallel reaction and thence constructed the surface of elasticity he showed that biots dihedral law is exact provided that the binormals are taken as the optic axes and the wave normal direction as the direction of propagation
as early as fresnel discussed his perpendicular axes with cauchy
acknowledging fresnels influence cauchy went on to develop the first rigorous theory of elasticity of non isotropic solids hence the first rigorous theory of transverse waves therein which he promptly tried to apply to optics
the ensuing difficulties drove a long competitive effort to find an accurate mechanical model of the aether
fresnels own model was not dynamically rigorous for example it deduced the reaction to a shear strain by considering the displacement of one particle while all others were fixed and it assumed that the stiffness determined the wave velocity as in a stretched string whatever the direction of the wave normal
but it was enough to enable the wave theory to do what selectionist theory could not generate testable formulae covering a comprehensive range of optical phenomena from mechanical assumptions
in brewster reported that colors appear when a slice of isotropic material placed between crossed polarizers is mechanically stressed
brewster himself immediately and correctly attributed this phenomenon to stress induced birefringence now known as photoelasticity
in a memoir read in september fresnel announced that he had verified brewsters diagnosis more directly by compressing a combination of glass prisms so severely that one could actually see a double image through it
in his experiment fresnel lined up seven prisms short side to short side with their angles pointing in alternating directions
two half prisms were added at the ends to make the whole assembly rectangular
the prisms were separated by thin films of turpentine to suppress internal reflections allowing a clear line of sight along the row
when the four prisms with similar orientations were compressed in a vise across the line of sight an object viewed through the assembly produced two images with perpendicular polarizations with an apparent spacing of mm at one metre
at the end of that memoir fresnel predicted that if the compressed prisms were replaced by monocrystalline quartz prisms with matching directions of optical rotation and with their optic axes aligned along the row an object seen by looking along the common optic axis would give two images which would seem unpolarized when viewed through an analyzer but when viewed through a fresnel rhomb would be polarized at to the plane of reflection of the rhomb
this would show directly that optical rotation is a form of birefringence
in the memoir of december in which he introduced the term circular polarization he reported that he had confirmed this prediction using only one prism and two glass half prisms
but he obtained a wider separation of the images by replacing the glass half prism with quartz half prisms whose rotation was opposite to that of the prism
he added in passing that one could further increase the separation by increasing the number of prisms
for the supplement to riffaults translation of thomsons system of chemistry fresnel was chosen to contribute the article on light
the resulting page essay titled de la lumire was apparently finished in june and published by february
with sections covering the nature of light diffraction thin film interference reflection and refraction double refraction and polarization chromatic polarization and modification of polarization by reflection it made a comprehensive case for the wave theory to a readership that was not restricted to physicists
to examine fresnels first memoir and supplements on double refraction the acadmie des sciences appointed ampre arago fourier and poisson
their report of which arago was clearly the main author was delivered at the meeting of august
then in the words of mile verdet as translated by ivor grattan guinness whether laplace was announcing his conversion to the wave theory at the age of is uncertain
grattan guinness entertained the idea
buchwald noting that arago failed to explain that the ellipsoid of elasticity did not give the correct planes of polarization suggests that laplace may have merely regarded fresnels theory as a successful generalization of maluss ray velocity law embracing biots laws
in the following year poisson who did not sign aragos report disputed the possibility of transverse waves in the aether
starting from assumed equations of motion of a fluid medium he noted that they did not give the correct results for partial reflection and double refraction as if that were fresnels problem rather than his own and that the predicted waves even if they were initially transverse became more longitudinal as they propagated
in reply fresnel noted inter alia that the equations in which poisson put so much faith did not even predict viscosity
the implication was clear given that the behavior of light had not been satisfactorily explained except by transverse waves it was not the responsibility of the wave theorists to abandon transverse waves in deference to pre conceived notions about the aether rather it was the responsibility of the aether modelers to produce a model that accommodated transverse waves
according to robert h
silliman poisson eventually accepted the wave theory shortly before his death in
among the french poissons reluctance was an exception
according to eugene frankel in paris no debate on the issue seems to have taken place after
indeed almost the entire generation of physicists and mathematicians who came to maturity in the s pouillet savart lam navier liouville cauchy seem to have adopted the theory immediately
fresnels other prominent french opponent biot appeared to take a neutral position in and eventually accepted the wave theory possibly by and certainly by
in the british astronomer john herschel who was working on a book length article on light for the encyclopdia metropolitana addressed three questions to fresnel concerning double refraction partial reflection and their relation to polarization
the resulting article titled simply light was highly sympathetic to the wave theory although not entirely free of selectionist language
it was circulating privately by and was published in
meanwhile youngs translation of fresnels de la lumire was published in installments from to
george biddell airy the former lucasian professor at cambridge and future astronomer royal unreservedly accepted the wave theory by
in he famously calculated the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture from the wave theory thereby explaining the limited angular resolution of a perfect telescope
by the end of the s the only prominent british physicist who held out against the wave theory was brewster whose objections included the difficulty of explaining photochemical effects and dispersion
a german translation of de la lumire was published in installments in and
the wave theory was adopted by fraunhofer in the early s and by franz ernst neumann in the s and then began to find favor in german textbooks
the economy of assumptions under the wave theory was emphasized by william whewell in his history of the inductive sciences first published in
in the corpuscular system every new class of facts requires a new supposition whereas in the wave system a hypothesis devised in order to explain one phenomenon is then found to explain or predict others
in the corpuscular system there is no unexpected success no happy coincidence no convergence of principles from remote quarters but in the wave system all tends to unity and simplicity
hence in when foucault and fizeau found by experiment that light travels more slowly in water than in air in accordance with the wave explanation of refraction and contrary to the corpuscular explanation the result came as no surprise
fresnel was not the first person to focus a lighthouse beam using a lens
that distinction apparently belongs to the london glass cutter thomas rogers whose first lenses cm in diameter and cm thick at the center were installed at the old lower lighthouse at portland bill in
further samples were installed in about half a dozen other locations by
but much of the light was wasted by absorption in the glass
nor was fresnel the first to suggest replacing a convex lens with a series of concentric annular prisms to reduce weight and absorption
in count buffon proposed grinding such prisms as steps in a single piece of glass
in the marquis de condorcet suggested that it would be easier to make the annular sections separately and assemble them on a frame but even that was impractical at the time
these designs were intended not for lighthouses but for burning glasses
brewster however proposed a system similar to condorcets in and by was advocating its use in british lighthouses
meanwhile on june fresnel was temporarily seconded by the commission des phares on the recommendation of arago to review possible improvements in lighthouse illumination
the commission had been established by napoleon in and placed under the corps des ponts fresnels employer
by the end of august unaware of the buffon condorcet brewster proposal fresnel made his first presentation to the commission recommending what he called lentilles chelons to replace the reflectors then in use which reflected only about half of the incident light
one of the assembled commissioners jacques charles recalled buffons suggestion leaving fresnel embarrassed for having again broken through an open door
but whereas buffons version was biconvex and in one piece fresnels was plano convex and made of multiple prisms for easier construction
with an official budget of francs fresnel approached three manufacturers
the third franois soleil produced the prototype
finished in march it had a square lens panel cm on a side containing polygonal prisms and so impressed the commission that fresnel was asked for a full eight panel version
this model completed a year later in spite of insufficient funding had panels cm square
in a public spectacle on the evening of april it was demonstrated by comparison with the most recent reflectors which it suddenly rendered obsolete
fresnels next lens was a rotating apparatus with eight bulls eye panels made in annular arcs by saint gobain giving eight rotating beams to be seen by mariners as a periodic flash
above and behind each main panel was a smaller sloping bulls eye panel of trapezoidal outline with trapezoidal elements
this refracted the light to a sloping plane mirror which then reflected it horizontally degrees ahead of the main beam increasing the duration of the flash
below the main panels were small mirrors arranged in four rings stacked like the slats of a louver or venetian blind
each ring shaped as a frustum of a cone reflected the light to the horizon giving a fainter steady light between the flashes
the official test conducted on the unfinished arc de triomphe on august was witnessed by the commission and by louis and his entourage from km away
the apparatus was stored at bordeaux for the winter and then reassembled at cordouan lighthouse under fresnels supervision
on july the worlds first lighthouse fresnel lens was lit
soon afterwards fresnel started coughing up blood
in may fresnel was promoted to secretary of the commission des phares becoming the first member of that body to draw a salary albeit in the concurrent role of engineer in chief
he was also an examiner at the cole polytechnique since but poor health long hours during the examination season and anxiety about judging others induced him to resign that post in late to save his energy for his lighthouse work
in the same year he designed the first fixed lens for spreading light evenly around the horizon while minimizing waste above or below
ideally the curved refracting surfaces would be segments of toroids about a common vertical axis so that the dioptric panel would look like a cylindrical drum
if this was supplemented by reflecting rings above and below the refracting parts the entire apparatus would look like a beehive
the second fresnel lens to enter service was indeed a fixed lens of third order installed at dunkirk by february
however due to the difficulty of fabricating large toroidal prisms this apparatus had a sided polygonal plan
in fresnel extended his fixed lens design by adding a rotating array outside the fixed array
each panel of the rotating array was to refract part of the fixed light from a horizontal fan into a narrow beam
also in fresnel unveiled the carte des phares calling for a system of lighthouses plus smaller harbor lights in a hierarchy of lens sizes with different characteristics to facilitate recognition a constant light one flash per minute and two per minute
in late to reduce the loss of light in the reflecting elements fresnel proposed to replace each mirror with a catadioptric prism through which the light would travel by refraction through the first surface then total internal reflection off the second surface then refraction through the third surface
the result was the lighthouse lens as we now know it
in he assembled a small model for use on the canal saint martin but he did not live to see a full sized version
the first fixed lens with toroidal prisms was a first order apparatus designed by the scottish engineer alan stevenson under the guidance of lonor fresnel and fabricated by isaac cookson co
from french glass it entered service at the isle of may in
the first large catadioptric lenses were fixed third order lenses made in for the lighthouses at gravelines and le vierge
the first fully catadioptric first order lens installed at ailly in gave eight rotating beams assisted by eight catadioptric panels at the top plus a fixed light from below
the first fully catadioptric lens with purely revolving beams also of first order was installed at saint clment des baleines in and marked the completion of augustin fresnels original carte des phares
production of one piece stepped dioptric lenses roughly as envisaged by buffon became practical in when john l
gilliland of the brooklyn flint glass company patented a method of making such lenses from press molded glass
by the s the substitution of plastic for glass made it economic to use fine stepped fresnel lenses as condensers in overhead projectors
still finer steps can be found in low cost plastic sheet magnifiers
fresnel was elected to the socit philomathique de paris in april and in became one of the editors of the socits bulletin des sciences
as early as may at aragos suggestion fresnel applied for membership of the acadmie des sciences but received only one vote
the successful candidate on that occasion was joseph fourier
in november fouriers elevation to permanent secretary of the acadmie created a vacancy in the physics section which was filled in february by pierre louis dulong with votes to fresnels
but in may after another vacancy was left by the death of jacques charles fresnels election was unanimous
in fresnel was made a chevalier de la lgion dhonneur
but the praise of english scholars soon followed
on june fresnel was made a foreign member of the royal society of london
in he was awarded the societys rumford medal for the year for his development of the undulatory theory as applied to the phenomena of polarized light and for his various important discoveries in physical optics
a monument to fresnel at his birthplace was dedicated on september with a speech by permanent secretary of the acadmie des sciences
is among the names embossed on the eiffel tower
in the th century as every lighthouse in france acquired a fresnel lens every one acquired a bust of fresnel seemingly watching over the coastline that he had made safer
the lunar features promontorium fresnel and rimae fresnel were later named after him
fresnels health which had always been poor deteriorated in the winter of increasing the urgency of his original research and preventing him from contributing an article on polarization and double refraction for the encyclopdia britannica
the memoirs on circular and elliptical polarization and optical rotation and on the detailed derivation of the fresnel equations and their application to total internal reflection date from this period
in the spring he recovered enough in his own view to supervise the lens installation at cordouan
soon afterwards it became clear that his condition was tuberculosis
in he was advised that if he wanted to live longer he needed to scale back his activities
perceiving his lighthouse work to be his most important duty he resigned as an examiner at the cole polytechnique and closed his scientific notebooks
his last note to the acadmie read on june described the first radiometer and attributed the observed repulsive force to a temperature difference
although his fundamental research ceased his advocacy did not as late as august or september he found the time to answer herschels queries on the wave theory
it was herschel who recommended fresnel for the royal societys rumford medal
fresnels cough worsened in the winter of leaving him too ill to return to mathieu in the spring
the acadmie meeting of april was the last that he attended
in early june he was carried to ville davray west of paris
there his mother joined him
on july arago arrived to deliver the rumford medal
sensing aragos distress fresnel whispered that the most beautiful crown means little when it is laid on the grave of a friend
fresnel did not have the strength to reply to the royal society
he died eight days later on bastille day
he is buried at pre lachaise cemetery paris
the inscription on his headstone is partly eroded away the legible part says when translated to the memory of augustin jean fresnel member of the institute of france
fresnels second memoir on double refraction was not printed until late a few months after his death
until then the best published source on his work on double refraction was an extract of that memoir printed in
his final treatment of partial reflection and total internal reflection read to the acadmie in january was thought to be lost until it was rediscovered among the papers of the deceased joseph fourier and was printed in
until then it was known chiefly through an extract printed in and
the memoir introducing the parallelepiped form of the fresnel rhomb read in march was mislaid until and then attracted such interest that it was soon republished in english
most of fresnels writings on polarized light before including his first theory of chromatic polarization and the crucial supplement of january were not published in full until his oeuvres compltes began to appear in
the supplement of july proposing the efficacious ray and reporting the famous double mirror experiment met the same fate as did the first memoir on double refraction
publication of fresnels collected works was itself delayed by the deaths of successive editors
the task was initially entrusted to flix savary who died in
it was restarted twenty years later by the ministry of public instruction
of the three editors eventually named in the oeuvres snarmont died in verdet in and lonor fresnel in by which time only two of the three volumes had appeared
at the beginning of vol
the completion of the project is described in a long footnote by j
not included in the oeuvres are two short notes by fresnel on magnetism which were discovered among ampres manuscripts
in response to rsteds discovery of electromagnetism in ampre initially supposed that the field of a permanent magnet was due to a macroscopic circulating current
fresnel suggested instead that there was a microscopic current circulating around each particle of the magnet
in his first note he argued that microscopic currents unlike macroscopic currents would explain why a hollow cylindrical magnet does not lose its magnetism when cut longitudinally
in his second note dated july he further argued that a macroscopic current had the counterfactual implication that a permanent magnet should be hot whereas microscopic currents circulating around the molecules might avoid the heating mechanism
he was not to know that the fundamental units of permanent magnetism are even smaller than molecules
the two notes together with ampres acknowledgment were eventually published in
fresnels essay rveries of has not survived
while its content would have been interesting to historians its quality may perhaps be gauged from the fact that fresnel himself never referred to it in his maturity
more disturbing is the fate of the late article sur les diffrents systmes relatifs la thorie de la lumire which fresnel wrote for the newly launched english journal european review
this work seems to have been similar in scope to the essay de la lumire of except that fresnels views on double refraction circular and elliptical polarization optical rotation and total internal reflection had developed since then
the manuscript was received by the publishers agent in paris in early september and promptly forwarded to london
but the journal failed before fresnels contribution could be published
fresnel tried unsuccessfully to recover the manuscript
the editors of his collected works were also unable to find it and admitted that it was probably lost
in arago found experimentally that the degree of refraction of starlight does not depend on the direction of the earths motion relative to the line of sight
in fresnel showed that this result could be explained by the wave theory on the hypothesis that if an object with refractive index formula moved at velocity formula relative to the external aether then the velocity of light inside the object gained the additional component formula
he supported that hypothesis by supposing that if the density of the external aether was taken as unity the density of the internal aether was formula of which the excess namely formula was dragged along at velocity formula whence the average velocity of the internal aether was formula
the factor in parentheses which fresnel originally expressed in terms of wavelengths became known as the fresnel drag coefficient
in his analysis of double refraction fresnel supposed that the different refractive indices in different directions within the same medium were due to a directional variation in elasticity not density
but in his treatment of partial reflection he supposed that the different refractive indices of different media were due to different aether densities not different elasticities
the latter decision although puzzling in the context of double refraction was consistent with the earlier treatment of aether drag
in george gabriel stokes pointed out that there was no need to divide the aether inside a moving object into two portions all of it could be considered as moving at a common velocity
then if the aether was conserved while its density changed in proportion to formula the resulting velocity of the aether inside the object was equal to fresnels additional velocity component
the analogy between light waves and transverse waves in elastic solids does not predict dispersion that is the frequency dependence of the speed of propagation which enables prisms to produce spectra and causes lenses to suffer from chromatic aberration
fresnel in de la lumire and in the second supplement to his first memoir on double refraction suggested that dispersion could be accounted for if the particles of the medium exerted forces on each other over distances that were significant fractions of a wavelength
later more than once fresnel referred to the demonstration of this result as being contained in a note appended to his second memoir on double refraction
no such note appeared in print and the relevant manuscripts found after his death showed only that around he was comparing refractive indices with a theoretical formula the meaning of which was not fully explained
in the s fresnels suggestion was taken up by cauchy baden powell and philip kelland and it was found to be tolerably consistent with the variation of refractive indices with wavelength over the visible spectrum for a variety of transparent media
these investigations were enough to show that the wave theory was at least compatible with dispersion if the model of dispersion was to be accurate over a wider range of frequencies it needed to be modified so as to take account of resonances within the medium
the analytical complexity of fresnels derivation of the ray velocity surface was an implicit challenge to find a shorter path to the result
this was answered by maccullagh in and by william rowan hamilton in
hamilton went further establishing two properties of the surface that fresnel in the short time given to him had overlooked at each of the four points where the inner and outer sheets of the surface make contact the surface has a tangent cone hence a cone of normals indicating that a cone of wave normal directions corresponds to a single ray velocity vector and around each of these points the outer sheet has a circle of contact with a tangent plane indicating that a cone of ray directions corresponds to a single wave normal velocity vector
as hamilton noted these properties respectively imply that a narrow beam propagating inside the crystal in the direction of the single ray velocity will on exiting the crystal through a flat surface break into a hollow cone and a narrow beam striking a flat surface of the crystal in the appropriate direction will on entering the crystal break into a hollow cone
thus a new pair of phenomena qualitatively different from anything previously observed or suspected had been predicted by mathematics as consequences of fresnels theory
the prompt experimental confirmation of those predictions by humphrey lloyd brought hamilton a prize that had never come to fresnel immediate fame
within a century of fresnels initial stepped lens proposal more than lights with fresnel lenses were protecting lives and property around the world
concerning the other benefits the science historian theresa h
levitt has remarked in the history of physical optics fresnels successful revival of the wave theory nominates him as the pivotal figure between newton who held that light consisted of corpuscles and james clerk maxwell who established that light waves are electromagnetic
whereas albert einstein described maxwells work as the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of newton commentators of the era between fresnel and maxwell made similarly strong statements about fresnel what whewell called the true theory has since undergone two major revisions
the first by maxwell specified the physical fields whose variations constitute the waves of light
without the benefit of this knowledge fresnel managed to construct the worlds first coherent theory of light showing in retrospect that his methods are applicable to multiple types of waves
the second revision initiated by einsteins explanation of the photoelectric effect supposed that the energy of light waves was divided into quanta which were eventually identified with particles called photons
but photons did not exactly correspond to newtons corpuscles for example newtons explanation of ordinary refraction required the corpuscles to travel faster in media of higher refractive index which photons do not
neither did photons displace waves rather they led to the paradox of wave particle duality
moreover the phenomena studied by fresnel which included nearly all the optical phenomena known at his time are still most easily explained in terms of the wave nature of light
so it was that as late as the astronomer eugne michel antoniadi declared fresnel to be the dominant figure in optics
some english translations of works by fresnel are included in the above bibliography
for a more comprehensive list see external links below
the most detailed secondary source on fresnel in english is apparently buchwald in which fresnel although not named in the title is clearly the central character
on lighthouse lenses this article heavily cites levitt elton and thomas tag at the us lighthouse society
all three authors deal not only with fresnels contributions but also with later innovations that are not mentioned here
by comparison with the volume and impact of his scientific and technical writings biographical information on fresnel is remarkably scarce
there is no book length critical biography of him and anyone who proposes to write one must confront the fact that the letters published in his oeuvres compltes contrary to the title are heavily redacted
in the words of robert h
silliman by an unhappy judgment of the editors dictated in part one suspects by political expediency the letters appear in fragmentary form preserving almost nothing beyond the technical discussions of fresnel and his correspondents
it is not clear from the secondary sources whether the manuscripts of those letters are still extant
abbot is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various western religious traditions including christianity
the office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery
the female equivalent is abbess
the title had its origin in the monasteries of egypt and syria spread through the eastern mediterranean and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery
the word is derived from the aramaic meaning father or meaning my father in the septuagint it was written as abbas
at first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk but it was soon restricted by canon law to certain priestly superiors
at times it was applied to various priests eg at the court of the frankish monarchy the and were chaplains to the merovingian and carolingian sovereigns court and army respectively
the title of abbot came into fairly general use in western monastic orders whose members include priests
an abbot from from compare is the head and chief governor of a community of monks called also in the east hegumen or archimandrite
the english version for a female monastic head is abbess
in egypt the first home of monasticism the jurisdiction of the abbot or archimandrite was but loosely defined
sometimes he ruled over only one community sometimes over several each of which had its own abbot as well
saint john cassian speaks of an abbot of the thebaid who had monks under him
by the rule of st benedict which until the cluniac reforms was the norm in the west the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community
the rule as was inevitable was subject to frequent violations but it was not until the foundation of the cluniac order that the idea of a supreme abbot exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order was definitely recognised
monks as a rule were laymen nor at the outset was the abbot any exception
for the reception of the sacraments and for other religious offices the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church
this rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city and necessity compelled the ordination of some monks
this innovation was not introduced without a struggle ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher spiritual life but before the close of the th century at least in the east abbots seem almost universally to have become deacons if not priests
the change spread more slowly in the west where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the th century
the ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils
thus at the first council of constantinople ad archimandrites or abbots sign with bishops
the second council of nicaea ad recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders below the diaconate a power usually reserved to bishops
abbots used to be subject to episcopal jurisdiction and continued generally so in fact in the west till the th century
the code of justinian expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight
the first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of faustus abbot of lerins at the council of arles ad but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced far more than to the arrogance of abbots rendered it increasingly frequent and in the th century the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control and making them responsible to the pope alone received an impulse from pope gregory the great
these exceptions introduced with a good object had grown into a widespread evil by the th century virtually creating an imperium in imperio and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese
in the th century the abbots of fulda claimed precedence of the archbishop of cologne
abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of st bernard and others adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre ring gloves and sandals
it has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the th century but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine
the first undoubted instance is the bull by which alexander ii in granted the use of the mitre to egelsinus abbot of the monastery of st augustine at canterbury
the mitred abbots in england were those of abingdon st albans bardney battle bury st edmunds st augustines canterbury colchester croyland evesham glastonbury gloucester st benets hulme hyde malmesbury peterborough ramsey reading selby shrewsbury tavistock thorney westminster winchcombe and st marys york
of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of glastonbury until in ad adrian iv granted it to the abbot of st albans in which monastery he had been brought up
next after the abbot of st albans ranked the abbot of westminster and then ramsey
elsewhere the mitred abbots that sat in the estates of scotland were of arbroath cambuskenneth coupar angus dunfermline holyrood iona kelso kilwinning kinloss lindores paisley melrose scone st andrews priory and sweetheart
to distinguish abbots from bishops it was ordained that their mitre should be made of less costly materials and should not be ornamented with gold a rule which was soon entirely disregarded and that the crook of their pastoral staff should turn inwards instead of outwards indicating that their jurisdiction was limited to their own house
the adoption of certain episcopal insignia by abbots was followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions which had to be specially but ineffectually guarded against by the lateran council ad
in the east abbots if in priests orders and with the consent of the bishop were as we have seen permitted by the second nicene council ad to confer the tonsure and admit to the order of reader but gradually abbots in the west also advanced higher claims until we find them in ad permitted by innocent iv to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate
of course they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit
the power of the abbot was paternal but absolute limited however by the canon law
one of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection
it was sacred duty to execute the abbots orders and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression
examples among the egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal are detailed by cassian and others eg a monk watering a dry stick day after day for months or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers
when a vacancy occurred the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the monastery but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot
in abbeys exempt from the archbishops diocesan jurisdiction the confirmation and benediction had to be conferred by the pope in person the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbots journey to rome
it was necessary that an abbot should be at least years of age of legitimate birth a monk of the house for at least years unless it furnished no suitable candidate when a liberty was allowed of electing from another monastery well instructed himself and able to instruct others one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience
in some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor
cassian speaks of an abbot in egypt doing this and in later times we have another example in the case of st bruno
popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks until in italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots and the king in france with the exception of cluny premontr and other houses chiefs of their order
the election was for life unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order or when he was directly subject to them by the pope or the bishop and also in england it was for a term of years
the ceremony of the formal admission of a benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of abingdon
the newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession
after proceeding up the nave he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary and placed in his stall
the monks then kneeling gave him the kiss of peace on the hand and rising on the mouth the abbot holding his staff of office
he then put on his shoes in the vestry and a chapter was held and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon
before the late modern era the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house
when he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed
his letters were received kneeling as were those of the pope and the king
no monk might sit in his presence or leave it without his permission reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society
the highest place was assigned to him both in church and at table
in the east he was commanded to eat with the other monks
in the west the rule of st benedict appointed him a separate table at which he might entertain guests and strangers
because this permission opened the door to luxurious living synods of aachen decreed that the abbot should dine in the refectory and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks unless he had to entertain a guest
these ordinances proved however generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots
when the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory his chaplains waited upon him with the dishes a servant if necessary assisting them
when abbots dined in their own private hall the rule of st benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table provided there was room on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels slanderous talk and idle gossiping
the ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks
but by the th century the rule was commonly set aside and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk and adopting sumptuous attire
some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether and assumed a secular dress
with the increase of wealth and power abbots had lost much of their special religious character and become great lords chiefly distinguished from lay lords by celibacy
thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt with their men carrying bows and arrows keeping horses dogs and huntsmen and special mention is made of an abbot of leicester c
who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting
in magnificence of equipage and retinue the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm
they rode on mules with gilded bridles rich saddles and housings carrying hawks on their wrist followed by an immense train of attendants
the bells of the churches were rung as they passed
they associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction and shared all their pleasures and pursuits
this rank and power was however often used most beneficially
for instance we read of richard whiting the last abbot of glastonbury judicially murdered by henry viii that his house was a kind of well ordered court where as many as sons of noblemen and gentlemen who had been sent to him for virtuous education had been brought up besides others of a lesser rank whom he fitted for the universities
his table attendance and officers were an honour to the nation
he would entertain as many as persons of rank at one time besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week
he had his country houses and fisheries and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of persons
the abbots of cluny and vendme were by virtue of their office cardinals of the roman church
in the process of time the title abbot was extended to clerics who had no connection with the monastic system as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy and under the carolingians to the chief chaplain of the king or military chaplain of the emperor it even came to be adopted by purely secular officials
thus the chief magistrate of the republic at genoa was called
lay abbots were the outcome of the growth of the feudal system from the th century onwards
the practice of commendation by which to meet a contemporary emergency the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord in return for his protection early suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held in commendam
during the carolingian epoch the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable fiefs or benefices and by the th century before the great cluniac reform the system was firmly established
even the abbey of st denis was held in commendam by hugh capet
the example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent sometimes without any form of commendation whatever
in england the abuse was rife in the th century as may be gathered from the acts of the council of cloveshoe
these lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations ie the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions
the lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other
the enfeoffment of abbeys differed in form and degree
sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions known usually as dean but also as abbot
when the great reform of the th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families as late as the th century and later with the head of the community retaining the title of dean
the connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys especially in the south of france lasted longer and certain feudal families retained the title of for centuries together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues
the abuse was not confined to the west
john patriarch of antioch at the beginning of the th century informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen for life or for part of their lives by the emperors
in conventual cathedrals where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a prior
in the roman catholic church abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term
a monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability a certain number of monks in vows a certain number of years of establishment a certain firmness to the foundation in economic vocational and legal aspects
prior to this the monastery would be a mere priory headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has
the abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks
once chosen he must request blessing the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or with his permission another abbot or bishop
the ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop with the new abbot being presented with the mitre the ring and the crosier as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant
though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority it does not confer further sacramental authority it is not a further degree of holy orders
once he has received this blessing the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense but their major superior under canon law and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector
the abbey is a species of exempt religious in that it is for the most part answerable to the pope or to the abbot primate rather than to the local bishop
the abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross
territorial abbots follow all of the above but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible
in some monastic families there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots
in some cases this is the result of an abbey being considered the mother of several daughter abbeys founded as dependent priories of the mother
in other cases abbeys have affiliated in networks known as congregations
some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order
the title abb as commonly used in the catholic church on the european continent is the equivalent of the english father being loosely applied to all who have received the tonsure
this use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of france by the concordat between pope leo x and francis i to appoint commendatory abbots to most of the abbeys in france
the expectation of obtaining these sinecures drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers and the class of abbs so formed they were sometimes called and sometimes came to hold a recognized position
the connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind consisting mainly in adopting the title of abb after a remarkably moderate course of theological study practising celibacy and wearing distinctive dress a short dark violet coat with narrow collar
being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure many of the class found admission to the houses of the french nobility as tutors or advisers
nearly every great family had its abb
the class did not survive the revolution but the courtesy title of abb having long lost all connection in peoples minds with any special ecclesiastical function remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman
in the eastern orthodox and eastern catholic churches the abbot is referred to as the hegumen
the superior of a monastery of nuns is called the hgumn
the title of archimandrite used to mean something similar
in the east the principle set forth in the corpus juris civilis still applies whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop
those monasteries which enjoy the status of being stauropegic will be subject only to a primate or his synod of bishops and not the local bishop
although currently in the western church the title abbot is given only abbots of monasteries the title archimandrite is given to monastics priests in the east even when not attached to a monastery as an honor for service similar to the title of monsignor in the latin church of the catholic church
in the eastern orthodox church only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite
married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of archpriest or protopresbyter
normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the orthodox church with the exception of married priests who have been widowed
since the time of catherine ii the ranks of abbot and archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the russian church and may be given to any monastic even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery
in greek practice the title or function of abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery although the title of the archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery
in the german evangelical church the german title of abt is sometimes bestowed like the french abb as an honorary distinction and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the reformation into collegiate foundations
of these the most noteworthy is loccum abbey in hanover founded as a cistercian house in by count wilbrand of hallermund and reformed in
the abbot of loccum who still carries a pastoral staff takes precedence over all the clergy of hanover and was ex officio a member of the of the kingdom
the governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot prior and the convent or community of stiftsherren
in the church of england the bishop of norwich by royal decree given by henry viii also holds the honorary title of abbot of st
this title hails back to englands separation from the see of rome when king henry as supreme head of the newly independent church took over all of the monasteries mainly for their possessions except for st
benet which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth and lived like simple beggars deposing the incumbent bishop of norwich and seating the abbot in his place thus the dual title still held to this day
additionally at the enthronement of the archbishop of canterbury there is a threefold enthronement once in the throne the chancel as the diocesan bishop of canterbury once in the chair of st
augustine as the primate of all england and then once in the chapter house as titular abbot of canterbury
there are several benedictine abbeys throughout the anglican communion
most of them have mitred abbots
the abbot is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of danse macabre
the lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to christian hagiography one of the most well known being the life of st
benedict of nursia by st
gregory the great
during the years ad daniel a russian orthodox abbot made a pilgrimage to the holy land and recorded his experiences
his diary was much read throughout russia and at least seventy five manuscript copies survive
saint joseph abbot of volokolamsk russia wrote a number of influential works against heresy and about monastic and liturgical discipline and christian philanthropy
in the tales of redwall series the creatures of redwall are led by an abbot or abbess
these abbots are appointed by the brothers and sisters of redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care much like real abbots
the abbot was a nickname of rza from the wu tang clan
ardipithecus is a genus of an extinct hominine that lived during the late miocene and early pliocene epochs in the afar depression ethiopia
originally described as one of the earliest ancestors of humans after they diverged from the chimpanzees the relation of this genus to human ancestors and whether it is a hominin is now a matter of debate
two fossil species are described in the literature a
ramidus which lived about million years ago during the early pliocene and a
kadabba dated to approximately million years ago
initial behavioral analysis indicated that ardipithecus could be very similar to chimpanzees however more recent analysis based on canine size and lack of canine sexual dimorphism indicates that ardipithecus was characterised by reduced aggression and that they more closely resemble bonobos
some analyses describe australopithecus as being sister to ardipithecus ramidus specifically
this means that australopithecus is distinctly closer related to ardipithecus ramidus than ardipithecus kadabba
cladistically then australopithecus indeed emerged within the ardipithecus lineage and this lineage is not literally extinct
ramidus was named in september
the first fossil found was dated to million years ago on the basis of its stratigraphic position between two volcanic strata the basal gaala tuff complex and the daam aatu basaltic tuff
the name ardipithecus ramidus stems mostly from the afar language in which ardi means ground floor and ramid means root
the pithecus portion of the name is from the greek word for ape
like most hominids but unlike all previously recognized hominins it had a grasping hallux or big toe adapted for locomotion in the trees
it is not confirmed how many other features of its skeleton reflect adaptation to bipedalism on the ground as well
like later hominins ardipithecus had reduced canine teeth and reduced canine sexual dimorphism
in a research team headed by tim white discovered the first a
ramidus fossils seventeen fragments including skull mandible teeth and arm bones from the afar depression in the middle awash river valley of ethiopia
more fragments were recovered in amounting to of the total skeleton
this fossil was originally described as a species of australopithecus but white and his colleagues later published a note in the same journal renaming the fossil under a new genus ardipithecus
between and a multidisciplinary team led by sileshi semaw discovered bones and teeth of nine a
ramidus individuals at as duma in the gona area of ethiopias afar region
the fossils were dated to between and million years old
ardipithecus ramidus had a small brain measuring between and cm
this is slightly smaller than a modern bonobo or female chimpanzee brain but much smaller than the brain of australopithecines like lucy and roughly the size of the modern homo sapiens brain
like common chimpanzees a
ramidus was much more prognathic than modern humans
the teeth of a
ramidus lacked the specialization of other apes and suggest that it was a generalized omnivore and frugivore with a diet that did not depend heavily on foliage fibrous plant material or hard and or abrasive food
the size of the upper canine tooth in a
ramidus males was not distinctly different from that of females
their upper canines were less sharp than those of modern common chimpanzees in part because of this decreased upper canine size as larger upper canines can be honed through wear against teeth in the lower mouth
the features of the upper canine in a
ramidus contrast with the sexual dimorphism observed in common chimpanzees where males have significantly larger and sharper upper canine teeth than females
of the living apes bonobos have the smallest canine sexual dimorphism although still greater than that displayed by a
the less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in a
ramidus has been used to infer aspects of the social behavior of the species and more ancestral hominids
in particular it has been used to suggest that the last common ancestor of hominids and african apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups
this is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high
researchers in a study said that this condition compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition
bonobo canine size and canine sexual dimorphism more closely resembles that of a
ramidus and as a result bonobos are now suggested as a behavioural model
ramidus existed more recently than the most recent common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor
nevertheless it is in some ways unlike chimpanzees suggesting that the common ancestor differs from the modern chimpanzee
after the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged both underwent substantial evolutionary change
chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees a
ramidus feet are better suited for walking
the canine teeth of a
ramidus are smaller and equal in size between males and females which suggests reduced male to male conflict increased pair bonding and increased parental investment
thus fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools the research team concluded
on october paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete a
ramidus fossil skeleton first unearthed in
the fossil is the remains of a small brained kilogram female nicknamed ardi and includes most of the skull and teeth as well as the pelvis hands and feet
it was discovered in ethiopias harsh afar desert at a site called aramis in the middle awash region
radiometric dating of the layers of volcanic ash encasing the deposits suggest that ardi lived about million years ago
this date however has been questioned by others
fleagle and kappelman suggest that the region in which ardi was found is difficult to date radiometrically and they argue that ardi should be dated at million years
the fossil is regarded by its describers as shedding light on a stage of human evolution about which little was known more than a million years before lucy the iconic early human ancestor candidate who lived million years ago and was discovered in just away from ardis discovery site
however because the ardi skeleton is no more than years older than the earliest fossils of australopithecus and may in fact be younger than they are a
ramidus had a more primitive walking ability than later hominids and could not walk or run for long distances
the teeth suggest omnivory and are more generalised than those of modern apes
ardipithecus kadabba is known only from teeth and bits and pieces of skeletal bones and is dated to approximately million years ago
it has been described as a probable chronospecies of a
although originally considered a subspecies of a
ramidus in anthropologists yohannes haile selassie gen suwa and tim d
white published an article elevating a
kadabba to species level on the basis of newly discovered teeth from ethiopia
these teeth show primitive morphology and wear pattern which demonstrate that a
kadabba is a distinct species from a
the specific name comes from the afar word for basal family ancestor
due to several shared characteristics with chimpanzees its closeness to ape divergence period and due to its fossil incompleteness the exact position of ardipithecus in the fossil record is a subject of controversy
primatologist esteban sarmiento had systematically compared and concluded that there is not sufficient anatomical evidence to support an exclusively human lineage
sarmiento noted that ardipithecus does not share any characteristics exclusive to humans and some of its characteristics suggest it diverged from humans prior to the human gorilla last common ancestor
his comparative study in on the molar and body segment lengths noted that some dimensions including short upper limbs and metacarpals are reminiscent of humans but other dimensions such as long toes and relative molar surface area are great ape like
sarmiento concluded that such length measures can change back and forth during evolution and are not very good indicators of relatedness
however some later studies still argue for its classification in the human lineage
in it was reported that the hand bones of ardipithecus australopithecus sediba and a
afarensis have the third metacarpal styloid process which is absent in other apes
unique brain organisations in ardipithecus are also found only in the australopithecus and homo
comparison of the tooth root morphology with those of the earlier sahelanthropus also indicated strong resemblance also pointing to inclusion to the human line
the ardipithecus length measures are good indicators of function and together with dental isotope data and the fauna and flora from the fossil site indicate ardipithecus was mainly a terrestrial quadruped collecting a large portion of its food on the ground
its arboreal behaviors would have been limited and suspension from branches solely from the upper limbs rare
a comparative study in on carbon and oxygen stable isotopes within modern and fossil tooth enamel revealed that ardipithecus fed both arboreally and on the ground in a more open habitat unlike chimpanzees
in australian anthropologists gary clark and maciej henneberg said that ardipithecus adults have a facial anatomy more similar to chimpanzee subadults than adults with a less projecting face and smaller canines and attributed this to a decrease in craniofacial growth in favour of brain growth
this is only seen in humans so they argued that the species may show the first trend towards human social parenting and sexual psychology
previously it was assumed that such ancient human ancestors behaved much like chimps but this is no longer considered to be a viable comparison
this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the growth of aramidus
the study also provides support for stephen jay goulds theory in ontogeny and phylogeny that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from dissociation of growth trajectories
clark and henneberg also argued that such shortening of the skull which may have caused a descension of the larynx as well as lordosis allowing better movement of the larynx increased vocal ability significantly pushing back the origin of language to well before the evolution of homo
they argued that self domestication was aided by the development of vocalization living in a pro social society
they conceded that chimps and a
ramidus likely had the same vocal capabilities but said that a
ramidus made use of more complex vocalizations and vocalized at the same level as a human infant due to selective pressure to become more social
this would have allowed their society to become more complex
they also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability
nonetheless their conclusions are highly speculative
according to scott simpson the gona projects physical anthropologist the fossil evidence from the middle awash indicates that both a
kadabba and a
ramidus lived in a mosaic of woodland and grasslands with lakes swamps and springs nearby but further research is needed to determine which habitat ardipithecus at gona preferred
anatomically ardi is closer to the orangutan than to the chimpanzee bonobo or gorilla
all three are adapted for knuckle walking on the forest floor and climbing trees
the orangutan spends virtually its entire life in the forest canopy
its anatomy allows for maximum reach by its upper limbs for overhead branches while its lower limbs have a narrow stance that enables it to balance while walking foot over foot on lower branches and vines
although not as closely related genetically as the knuckle walking apes this would indicate that ardi was behaviourly more similar to the orangutan than to the other three great apes
in nature the orangutan is widely dispersed
there is one dominant male in a territory with wide cheek flaps who maintains contact with others in his territory by vocalizations
the female raises offspring one at a time with a maturation period of about eight years
this is the longest maturation period of any of the apes
during this period the offspring learns the intricate task of weaving a sleeping platform
rescue centers are now raising young orangutans that have lost their mother typically from deforestation
they are raised in age cohorts by these centers to learn the necessary skills to be able to be released into the forest
while in these cohorts they show social behavior reminiscent of age appropriate behavior of human children
this suggests that ardi was physically preadapted for bipedal locomotion as well as social behavior
an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which parts are added as the semi finished assembly moves from workstation to workstation where the parts are added in sequence until the final assembly is produced
by mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi finished assembly from work station to work station a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly
assembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as automobiles and other transportation equipment household appliances and electronic goods
workers in charge of the works of assembly line are called assemblers
assembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of workers tools or machines and parts
the motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible
all parts or assemblies are handled either by conveyors or motorized vehicles such as forklifts or gravity with no manual trucking
heavy lifting is done by machines such as overhead cranes or forklifts
each worker typically performs one simple operation unless job rotation strategies are applied
designing assembly lines is a well established mathematical challenge referred to as an assembly line balancing problem
in the simple assembly line balancing problem the aim is to assign a set of tasks that need to be performed on the workpiece to a sequence of workstations
each task requires a given task duration for completion
the assignment of tasks to stations is typically limited by two constraints a precedence graph which indicates what other tasks need to be completed before a particular task can be initiated and a cycle time which restricts the sum of task processing times which can be completed at each workstation before the work piece is moved to the next station by the conveyor belt
major planning problems for operating assembly lines include supply chain integration inventory control and production scheduling
consider the assembly of a car assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine install the hood and install the wheels only one of these steps can be done at a time
in traditional production only one car would be assembled at a time
if engine installation takes minutes hood installation takes five minutes and wheels installation takes minutes then a car can be produced every minutes
in an assembly line car assembly is split between several stations all working simultaneously
when a station is finished with a car it passes it on to the next
by having three stations three cars can be operated on at the same time each at a different stage of assembly
after finishing its work on the first car the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car
while the engine installation crew works on the second car the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels
after the engine has been installed on the second car the second car moves to the hood assembly
at the same time the third car moves to the engine assembly
when the third cars engine has been mounted it then can be moved to the hood station meanwhile subsequent cars can be moved to the engine installation station
assuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another the longest stage on the assembly line determines the throughput so a car can be produced every minutes once the first car taking minutes has been produced
before the industrial revolution most manufactured products were made individually by hand
a single craftsman or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product
they would use their skills and tools such as files and knives to create the individual parts
they would then assemble them into the final product making cut and try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together
division of labor was practiced in china where state run monopolies mass produced metal agricultural implements china armor and weapons centuries before mass production appeared in europe on the eve of the industrial revolution
adam smith discussed the division of labour in the manufacture of pins at length in his book the wealth of nations
the venetian arsenal dating to about operated similar to a production line
ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed
at the peak of its efficiency in the early th century the arsenal employed some people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day and could fit out arm and provision a newly built galley with standardized parts on an assembly line basis
although the arsenal lasted until the early industrial revolution production line methods did not become common even then
the industrial revolution led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention
many industries notably textiles firearms clocks and watches horse drawn vehicles railway locomotives sewing machines and bicycles saw expeditious improvement in materials handling machining and assembly during the th century although modern concepts such as industrial engineering and logistics had not yet been named
the automatic flour mill built by oliver evans in was called the beginning of modern bulk material handling by roe
evanss mill used a leather belt bucket elevator screw conveyors canvas belt conveyors and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour
the innovation spread to other mills and breweries
probably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the portsmouth block mills built between and
marc isambard brunel with the help of henry maudslay and others designed types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging blocks used by the royal navy
this factory was so successful that it remained in use until the s with the workshop still visible at hm dockyard in portsmouth and still containing some of the original machinery
one of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout designed for easy material handling was the bridgewater foundry
the factory grounds were bordered by the bridgewater canal and the liverpool and manchester railway
the buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings
cranes were used for lifting the heavy work which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons
the work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly
the first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of richard garrett sons leiston works in leiston in the english county of suffolk for the manufacture of portable steam engines
the assembly line area was called the long shop on account of its length and was fully operational by early
the boiler was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added
from the upper level where other parts were made the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level
when the machine reached the end of the shop it would be completed
during the early th century the development of machine tools such as the screw cutting lathe metal planer and milling machine and of toolpath control via jigs and fixtures provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making interchangeable parts a practical reality
steam powered conveyor lifts began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the th century
hounshell shows a sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory
the meatpacking industry of chicago is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines to be utilized in the united states starting in
workers would stand at fixed stations and a pulley system would bring the meat to each worker and they would complete one task
henry ford and others have written about the influence of this slaughterhouse practice on the later developments at ford motor company
according to domm the implementation of mass production of an automobile via an assembly line may be credited to ransom olds who used it to build the first mass produced automobile the oldsmobile curved dash
olds patented the assembly line concept which he put to work in his olds motor vehicle company factory in
at ford motor company the assembly line was introduced by william pa klann upon his return from visiting swift companys slaughterhouse in chicago and viewing what was referred to as the disassembly line where carcasses were butchered as they moved along a conveyor
the efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention
he reported the idea to peter e
martin soon to be head of ford production who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed
others at ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to henry ford but pa klanns slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the henry ford museum and elsewhere making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept
ford was appreciative having visited the highly automated acre sears mail order handling facility around
at ford the process was an evolution by trial and error of a team consisting primarily of peter e
martin the factory superintendent charles e
sorensen martins assistant clarence w
avery c
harold wills draftsman and toolmaker charles ebender and jzsef galamb
some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of machine tool placement that walter flanders had been doing at ford up to
the moving assembly line was developed for the ford model t and began operation on october at the highland park ford plant and continued to evolve after that using time and motion study
the assembly line driven by conveyor belts reduced production time for a model t to just minutes by dividing the process into steps
producing cars quicker than paint of the day could dry it had an immense influence on the world
charles e
sorensen in his memoir my forty years with ford presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual inventors as a gradual logical development of industrial engineering as a result of these developments in method fords cars came off the line in three minute intervals or six feet per minute
this was much faster than previous methods increasing production by eight to one while using less manpower
it was so successful paint became a bottleneck
only japan black would dry fast enough forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before until fast drying duco lacquer was developed in
the assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into american society
decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the model t to fall within the budget of the american middle class
in the price of a model t was around and by it had decreased to around
this price reduction is comparable to a reduction from to in dollar terms from the year
in an assembly line worker could buy a model t with four months pay
fords complex safety procedures especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about dramatically reduced the rate of injury
the combination of high wages and high efficiency is called fordism and was copied by most major industries
the efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take off of the united states
the assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods
in the automotive industry its success was dominating and quickly spread worldwide
ford france and ford britain in ford denmark ford germany and ford japan in vulcan was the first native european manufacturer to adopt it
soon companies had to have assembly lines or risk going broke by not being able to compete by companies which did not had disappeared
the massive demand for military hardware in world war ii prompted assembly line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production
thousands of liberty ships were built making extensive use of prefabrication enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days
after having produced fewer than planes for the united states military in american aircraft manufacturers built over planes in world war ii
vultee pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing
other companies quickly followed
as william s
knudsen observed we won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production the like of which he had never seen nor dreamed possible
the gains in productivity allowed ford to increase worker pay from per day to per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line
ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the model t price
these goals appear altruistic however it has been argued that they were implemented by ford in order to reduce high employee turnover when the assembly line was introduced in it was discovered that every time the company wanted to add men to its factory personnel it was necessary to hire in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired
sociological work has explored the social alienation and boredom that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long
one of capitalisms most famous critics karl marx expressed in his entfremdung theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created that products should be mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature
marx viewed labour as a chance for people to externalize facets of their personalities
marxists argue that performing repetitive specialized tasks causes a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day who they really are and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society
furthermore marx views these specialised jobs as insecure since the worker is expendable as soon as costs rise and technology can replace more expensive human labour
since workers have to stand in the same place for hours and repeat the same motion hundreds of times per day repetitive stress injuries are a possible pathology of occupational safety
industrial noise also proved dangerous
when it was not too high workers were often prohibited from talking
charles piaget a skilled worker at the lip factory recalled that besides being prohibited from speaking the semi skilled workers had only centimeters in which to move
industrial ergonomics later tried to minimize physical trauma
adelaide is the capital city of south australia the states largest city and the fifth most populous city in australia
adelaide may refer to either greater adelaide or the adelaide city centre
the demonym adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of adelaide
the traditional owners of the adelaide region are the kaurna people
the area of the city centre and surrounding park lands is called in the kaurna language
adelaide is situated on the adelaide plains north of the fleurieu peninsula between the gulf st vincent in the west and the mount lofty ranges in the east
its metropolitan area extends from the coast to the foothills of the mount lofty ranges and stretches from gawler in the north to sellicks beach in the south
named in honour of queen adelaide the city was founded in as the planned capital for the only freely settled british province in australia
colonel william light one of adelaides founding fathers designed the city centre and chose its location close to the river torrens
lights design now listed as national heritage set out the city centre in a grid layout known as lights vision interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares and entirely surrounded by park lands
early colonial adelaide was shaped by the diversity and wealth of its free settlers in contrast to the convict history of other australian cities
it was australias third most populated city until the post war era
it has been noted for its leading examples of religious freedom and progressive political reforms and became known as the city of churches due to its diversity of faiths
today adelaide is known by its many festivals and sporting events its food and wine its coastline and hills its large defence and manufacturing sectors and its emerging space sector including the australian space agency being headquartered here
adelaides quality of life has ranked consistently highly in various measures through the st century at one stage being named australias most liveable city
as south australias government and commercial centre adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions
most of these are concentrated in the city centre along the cultural boulevards of north terrace and king william street
the area around modern day adelaide was originally inhabited by the indigenous kaurna people one of many aboriginal nations in south australia
the city and parklands area was known as tarntanya tandanya now the short name of tandanya national aboriginal cultural institute tarndanya or tarndanyangga now the dual name for victoria square in the kaurna language
the name means male red kangaroo rock referring to a rock formation on the site that has now been destroyed
the surrounding area was an open grassy plain with patches of trees and shrubs which had been managed by hundreds of generations
kaurna country encompassed the plains which stretched north and south of tarntanya as well as the wooded foothills of the mt lofty ranges
the river torrens was known as the karrawirra pari
about kaurna populated the adelaide area and were referred to by the settlers as the cowandilla
there were more than local clans across the plain who lived semi nomadic lives with extensive mound settlements where huts were built repeatedly over centuries and a complex social structure including a class of sorcerers separated from regular society
within a few decades of european settlement of south australia kaurna culture was almost completely destroyed
the last speaker of kaurna language died in
extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both which has included a commitment by local and state governments to rename or include kaurna names for many local places
based on the ideas of edward gibbon wakefield about colonial reform robert gouger petitioned the british government to create a new colony in australia resulting in the passage of the south australia act
physical establishment of the colony began with the arrival of the first british colonisers in february
the first governor proclaimed the commencement of colonial government in south australia on december near the old gum tree in what is now the suburb of glenelg north
the event is commemorated in south australia as proclamation day
the site of the colonys capital was surveyed and laid out by colonel william light the first surveyor general of south australia with his own original unique topographically sensitive design
the city was named after queen adelaide
adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution based upon the ideas of edward gibbon wakefield
wakefield had read accounts of australian settlement while in prison in london for attempting to abduct an heiress and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals
wakefields idea was for the government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen
funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land
as a result of this policy adelaide does not share the convict settlement history of other australian cities like sydney brisbane and hobart
as it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime no provision was made for a gaol in colonel lights plan
but by mid the south australian register was warning of escaped convicts from new south wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought
following a burglary a murder and two attempted murders in adelaide during march governor hindmarsh created the south australian police force in april under year old henry inman
the first sheriff samuel smart was wounded during a robbery and on may one of the offenders michael magee became the first person to be hanged in south australia
william baker ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in and in george strickland kingston was commissioned to design adelaides new gaol
construction of adelaide gaol commenced in
adelaides early history was marked by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership
the first governor of south australia john hindmarsh clashed frequently with others in particular the resident commissioner james hurtle fisher
the rural area surrounding adelaide was surveyed by light in preparation to sell a total of over of land
adelaides early economy started to get on its feet in with the arrival of livestock from victoria new south wales and tasmania
wool production provided an early basis for the south australian economy
by wheat farms had been established from encounter bay in the south to clare in the north
george gawler took over from hindmarsh in late and despite being under orders from the select committee on south australia in britain not to undertake any public works promptly oversaw construction of a governors house the adelaide gaol police barracks a hospital a customs house and a wharf at port adelaide
gawler was recalled and replaced by george edward grey in
grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition although its impact was negligible at this point silver was discovered in glen osmond that year agriculture was well underway and other mines sprung up all over the state aiding adelaides commercial development
the city exported meat wool wine fruit and wheat by the time grey left in contrasting with a low point in when one third of adelaide houses were abandoned
trade links with the rest of the australian states were established after the murray river was successfully navigated in by francis cadell an adelaide resident
south australia became a self governing colony in with the ratification of a new constitution by the british parliament
secret ballots were introduced and a bicameral parliament was elected on march by which time people lived in the province
in the thorndon park reservoir was opened providing an alternative water source to the now turbid river torrens
gas street lighting was implemented in the university of adelaide was founded in the south australian art gallery opened in and the happy valley reservoir opened in
in the s australia was affected by a severe economic depression ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism
financial institutions in melbourne and banks in sydney closed
the national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle
the value of south australias exports nearly halved
drought and poor harvests from compounded the problems with some families leaving for western australia
adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold rush cities of sydney and melbourne and silver and lead discoveries at broken hill provided some relief
only one year of deficit was recorded but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending
wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn
adelaide was australias third largest city for most of the th century
electric street lighting was introduced in and electric trams were transporting passengers in
men were sent to fight in world war i
historian f
crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early th century noting that many visitors to adelaide admired the foresighted planning of its founders as well as pondering the riches of the young city
adelaide enjoyed a postwar boom entering a time of relative prosperity
its population grew and it became the third most populous metropolitan area in the country after sydney and melbourne
its prosperity was short lived with the return of droughts and the great depression of the s
it later returned to fortune under strong government leadership
secondary industries helped reduce the states dependence on primary industries
world war ii brought industrial stimulus and diversification to adelaide under the playford government which advocated adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location
shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of whyalla
the south australian government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries but neglected cultural facilities which meant south australias economy lagged behind
international manufacturers like general motors holden and chrysler made use of these factories around the adelaide area in suburbs like elizabeth completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a th century motor city
the mannum adelaide pipeline brought river murray water to adelaide in and an airport opened at west beach in
flinders university and the flinders medical centre were established in the s at bedford park south of the city
today flinders medical centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals in south australia

mount lofty east of the adelaide metropolitan region in the adelaide hills at an elevation of is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of burra
the city borders the temperate grassland of south australia in the east an endangered vegetation community
much of adelaide was bushland before british settlement with some variation sandhills swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast
the loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion
where practical the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of adelaides beachside suburbs
tennyson dunes is the largest contiguous tertiary dune system contained entirely within metropolitan adelaide providing refuge for a variety of remnant species formerly found along the entire coastline

the uplands of the adelaide hills part of the southern mount lofty ranges to the east of adelaide are defined on their western side by a number of arcuate faults and consist of rocks such as siltstone dolomite and quartzite dating from the neoproterozoic to the middle cambrian laid down in the adelaide rift complex the oldest part of the adelaide superbasin
most of the adelaide metropolitan area lies in the downthrown st vincent basin and its embayments including the adelaide plains sub basin and the golden grove noarlunga and willunga embayments
these basins contain deposits of tertiary marine and non marine sands and limestones which form important aquifers
these deposits are overlain by quaternary alluvial fans and piedmont slope deposits derived from erosion of the uplands consisting of sands clays and gravels interfingering to the west with transgressive pleistocene to holocene marine sands and coastal sediments of the shoreline of gulf st vincent
adelaide is a planned city designed by the first surveyor general of south australia colonel william light
his plan sometimes referred to as lights vision arranged adelaide in a grid with five squares in the adelaide city centre and a ring of parks known as the adelaide parklands surrounding it
lights selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers as well as south australias first governor john hindmarsh due to its distance from the harbour at port adelaide and the lack of fresh water there
light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition
recent evidence suggests that light worked closely with george kingston as well as a team of men to set out adelaide using various templates for city plans going back to ancient greece including italian renaissance designs and the similar layouts of the american cities philadelphia and savannah which like adelaide follow the same layout of a central city square four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that surrounds the city centre
the benefits of lights design are numerous adelaide has had wide multi lane roads from its beginning an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre
there are two sets of ring roads in adelaide that have resulted from the original design
the inner ring route borders the parklands and the outer route completely bypasses the inner city via grand junction road hampstead road ascot avenue portrush road cross road and south road
suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown lights original plan
numerous former outlying villages and country towns as well as the satellite city of elizabeth have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl
expanding developments in the adelaide hills region led to the construction of the south eastern freeway to cope with growth which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor
similarly the booming development in adelaides south led to the construction of the southern expressway
new roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth
the o bahn busway is an example of a unique solution to tea tree gullys transport woes in the s
the development of the nearby suburb of golden grove in the late s is an example of well thought out urban planning
in the s a metropolitan adelaide transport study plan was proposed to cater for the future growth of the city
the plan involved the construction of freeways expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system
the then premier steele hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project
the later labor government elected under don dunstan shelved the plan but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant should the future need for freeways arise
in the liberal party won government and premier david tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the mats plan ensuring that even when needs changed the construction of most mats proposed freeways would be impractical
some parts of this land have been used for transport while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use
in the sa government announced plans for a network of transport oriented developments across the adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a hectare industrial site at bowden for million as the first of these developments
historically adelaides suburban residential areas have been characterised by single storey detached houses built on blocks
a relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick making industry as well as the use of stone for houses and other buildings
by of houses were built of stone of timber and of brick with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins door and window surrounds and chimneys and fireplaces
there is a wide variety in the styles of these houses
until the s most of the more substantial houses were built of red brick though many front walls were of ornamental stone
then cream bricks became fashionable and in the s deep red and brown bricks became popular
until the s roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or cement or clay tiles usually red terracotta
since then colorbond corrugated steel has dominated
most roofs are pitched
flat roofs are not common
up to the s most houses were of double brick construction on concrete footings with timber floors laid on joists supported by dwarf walls
later houses have mainly been of brick veneer construction structural timber or more recently lightweight steel frame on a concrete slab foundation lined with gyprock and with an outer skin of brickwork to cope with adelaides reactive soils particularly keswick clay black earth and some red brown earth soils
the use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased
in addition to this a significant factor in adelaides suburban history is the role of the south australian housing trust

in the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation
in the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up

alan garner is an english novelist best known for his childrens fantasy novels and his retellings of traditional british folk tales
much of his work is rooted in the landscape history and folklore of his native county of cheshire north west england being set in the region and making use of the native cheshire dialect
born in congleton garner grew up around the nearby town of alderley edge and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as the edge where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region
studying at manchester grammar school and then briefly at oxford university in he moved to the village of blackden where he bought and renovated an early modern period building known as toad hall
his first novel the weirdstone of brisingamen was published in
a childrens fantasy novel set on the edge it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters
garner wrote a sequel the moon of gomrath and a third book boneland
he wrote several fantasy novels including elidor the owl service and red shift
turning away from fantasy as a genre garner produced the stone book quartet a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family
he also published a series of british folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled alan garners fairy tales of gold alan garners book of british fairy tales and a bag of moonshine
in his subsequent novels strandloper and thursbitch he continued writing tales revolving around cheshire although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work
garner was born in the front room of his grandmothers house in congleton cheshire on october
he was raised in nearby alderley edge a well to do village that had effectively become a suburb of manchester
his rural working class family had been connected to alderley edge since at least the sixteenth century and could be traced back to the death of william garner in
garner has stated that his family had passed on a genuine oral tradition involving folk tales about the edge which included a description of a king and his army of knights who slept under it guarded by a wizard
in the mid nineteenth century alans great great grandfather robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the face of a cliff next to a well known locally at that time as the wizards well
robert garner and his other relatives had all been craftsmen and according to garner each successive generation had tried to improve on or do something different from the previous generation
garners grandfather joseph garner could read but didnt and so was virtually unlettered
instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about the edge
garner later remarked that as a result he was aware of edges magic as a child and he and his friends often played there
the story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life becoming he explained deeply embedded in my psyche and heavily influencing his later novels
garner faced several life threatening childhood illnesses which left him bed ridden for much of the time
he attended a local village school where he found that despite being praised for his intelligence he was punished for speaking in his native cheshire dialect for instance when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water
garner then won a place at manchester grammar school where he received his secondary education entry was means tested resulting in his school fees being waived
rather than focusing his interest on creative writing it was here that he excelled at sprinting
he used to go jogging along the highway and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician alan turing who shared his fascination for the disney film snow white and the seven dwarfs
garner was then conscripted into national service serving for a time with the royal artillery while posted to woolwich in southeast london
at school garner had developed a keen interest in the work of aeschylus and homer as well as the ancient greek language
thus he decided to pursue the study of classics at magdalen college oxford passing his entrance exams in january at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic
he was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education and he noted that this removed him from his cultural background and led to something of a schism with other members of his family who could not cope with me and i could not cope with them
looking back he remarked i soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs
in he joined the university theatrical society playing the role of mark antony in a performance of william shakespeares antony and cleopatra where he co starred alongside dudley moore and where kenneth baker was the stage manager
in august he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree he left oxford in late
he nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained a permanent strength through all my life
aged garner was out cycling when he came across a hand painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in toad hall a late medieval building situated in blackden seven miles from alderley edge was on sale for
although he personally could not afford it he was lent the money by the local oddfellow lodge enabling him to purchase and move into the cottage in june
in the late nineteenth century the hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers cottages but garner was able to purchase the second for about a year later he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home
garner had begun writing his first novel the weirdstone of brisingamen a tale of alderley in september
however it was while at toad hall that he finished the book
set in alderley edge it revolves around two children susan and colin who are sent to live in the area with their mothers old nursemaid bess and her husband gowther mossock
while exploring the edge they encounter a race of malevolent creatures the svart alfar who dwell in the edges abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them
they are rescued by the wizard cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are massing at the edge in search of a powerful magical talisman the eponymous weirdstone of brisingamen
whilst writing in his spare time garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher but soon gave that up believing that i couldnt write and teach the energies were too similar
instead he worked off and on as a general labourer for four years remaining unemployed for much of that time
garner sent his debut novel to the publishing company collins where it was picked up by the companys head sir william collins who was on the lookout for new fantasy novels following the recent commercial and critical success of j
tolkiens the lord of the rings
garner who went on to become a personal friend of collins would later relate that billy collins saw a title with funny looking words in it on the stockpile and he decided to publish it
on its release in the weirdstone of brisingamen proved to be a critical and commercial success later being described as a tour de force of the imagination a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children
garner himself however would later denounce his first novel as a fairly bad book in
with his first book published garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter living a hand to mouth lifestyle on a shoestring budget
he also began a sequel to the weirdstone of brisingamen which would be known as the moon of gomrath
the moon of gomrath also revolves around the adventures of colin and susan with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the brollachan who has recently re entered the world having been freed from its underground prison by workmen
with the help of the wizard cadellin the brollachan is exorcised but susans soul also leaves her body being sent to another dimension leaving colin to find a way to bring it back
critic neil philip characterised it as an artistic advance but a less satisfying story
in a interview garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of colin and susan envisioning a trilogy but that he had intentionally decided not to write it instead moving on to write something different
however boneland the conclusion to the sequence was belatedly published in august
in garner began work on a radio play entitled elidor which eventually became a novel of the same name
set in contemporary manchester elidor tells the story of four children who enter a derelict victorian church and find a portal to the magical realm of elidor
in elidor they are entrusted by king malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of the kingdom
the children succeed and return to manchester with the treasures but are pursued by the malevolent forces who need the items to seal their victory
before writing elidor garner had seen a dinner service set which could be arranged to make pictures of either flowers or owls
inspired by this design he produced his fourth novel the owl service
the story which was heavily influenced by the medieval welsh tale of math fab mathonwy from the mabinogion was critically acclaimed winning both the carnegie medal and guardian childrens fiction prize
it also sparked discussions among critics as to whether garner should properly be considered a childrens writer given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership
it took garner six years to write his next novel red shift
the book centres on three intertwined love stories one set in the present another during the english civil war and the third in the second century ce
philip referred to it as a complex book but not a complicated one the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear
academic specialist in childrens literature maria nikolajeva characterised red shift as a difficult book for an unprepared reader identifying its main themes as those of loneliness and failure to communicate
ultimately she thought that repeated re readings of the novel bring about the realisation that it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so called realistic juvenile novels
from to garner published a series of four novellas which have come to be collectively known as the stone book quartet the stone book granny reardun the aimer gate and tom fobbles day
each focused on a day in the life of a child in the garner family each from a different generation
in a interview garner noted that although writing the stone book quartet had been exhausting it had been the most rewarding of everything hed done to date
philip described the quartet as a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career
garner pays particular attention to language and strives to render the cadence of the cheshire tongue in modern english
this he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading sir gawain and the green knight the footnotes would not have been needed by his father
in the literary critic neil philip published an analysis of garners novels as a fine anger which was based on his doctoral thesis produced for the university of london in
in this study he noted that the stone book quartet marks a watershed in garners writing career and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far
in garners novel strandloper was published
in he next wrote the voice that thunders a collection of essays and public talks that contains much autobiographical material as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language literature and education the nature of myth and time
in the voice that thunders he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade long drought which preceded strandloper to forsake literature and become instead a popular writer cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to and making series of the earlier books
garner feared that making series
would render sterile the existing work the life that produced it and bring about my artistic and spiritual death and felt unable to comply
garners novel thursbitch was published in
the novel boneland was published in nominally completing a trilogy begun some years earlier with the weirdstone of brisingamen
in august garner published his only set of memoirs where shall we run to which describes his childhood during the second world war
the novel treacle walker was published in october and nominated to the shortlist for the booker prize
with his first wife ann cook he had three children
in he married for a second time this time to griselda greaves a teacher and critic with whom he had two children
in a interview conducted with mike pitts for british archaeology magazine garner stated that i dont have anything to do with the literary world
i avoid writers
i dont like them
most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists
although garners early work is often labelled as childrens literature garner himself rejects such a description informing one interviewer that i certainly have never written for children but that instead he has always written purely for himself
neil philip in his critical study of garners work commented that up until that point everything alan garner has published has been published for children although he went on to relate that it may be that garners is a case where the division between childrens and adults literature is meaningless and that his fiction is instead enjoyed by a type of person no matter what their age
he said an adult point of view would not give me the ability to be as fresh in my vision as a childs point of view because the child is still discovering the universe and many adults are not
philip offered the opinion that the essence of his work was the struggle to render the complex in simple bare terms to couch the abstract in the concrete and communicate it directly to the reader
he added that garners work is intensely autobiographical in both obvious and subtle ways
highlighting garners use of mythological and folkloric sources philip stated that his work explores the disjointed and troubled psychological and emotional landscape of the twentieth century through the symbolism of myth and folklore
he also expressed the opinion that time is garners most consistent theme
the english author and academic catherine butler noted that garner was attentive to the geological archaeological and cultural history of his settings and careful to integrate his fiction with the physical reality beyond the page
as a part of this garner had included maps of alderley edge in both the weirdstone of brisingamen and the moon of gomrath
garner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books writing in the times literary supplement in garner commented that in preparation for writing his book elidor i had to read extensively textbooks on physics celtic symbolism unicorns medieval watermarks megalithic archaeology study the writings of jung brush up my plato visit avebury silbury and coventry cathedral spend a lot of time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites and listen to the whole of brittens war requiem nearly every day
in a paper published in the childrens literature association quarterly maria nikolajeva characterised garner as one of the most controversial authors of modern childrens literature
in the fiftieth anniversary edition of the weirdstone of brisingamen published by harpercollins in several notable british fantasists praised garner and his work
susan cooper wrote that the power and range of alan garners astounding talent has grown with every book hes written and david almond called him one of britains greatest writers whose works really matter
philip pullman the author of the his dark materials trilogy went further garner is indisputably the great originator the most important british writer of fantasy since tolkien and in many respects better than tolkien because deeper and more truthful
any country except britain would have long ago recognised his importance and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street names
but thats the way with us our greatest prophets go unnoticed by the politicians and the owners of media empires
i salute him with the most heartfelt respect and admiration
another british fantasy writer neil gaiman claimed that garners fiction is something special in that it was smart and challenging based in the here and the now in which real english places emerged from the shadows of folklore and in which people found themselves walking living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth
praise also came from nick lake the editorial director of harpercollins childrens books who proclaimed that garner is quite simply one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced
emma donoghue recalls reading red shift as a teenager it looked like other garners i had read a childrens fantasy
but red shift with its passionately bickering adolescent lovers and vertiginous plunges through the wormhole of time shook me to my core every time i read it and still does
garner makes the past numinous terrifyingly real anything but passed
the biennial hans christian andersen award conferred by the international board on books for young people is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of childrens books
garner was the sole runner up for the writing award in
garner was appointed officer of the order of the british empire for services to literature in the new years honours list
he received the british fantasy societys occasional karl edward wagner award in and the world fantasy award for life achievement in
in january the university of warwick awarded the degree of doctor of letters
on that occasion he gave a half hour interview about his work
he has also been awarded honorary doctorates from the university of salford and the university of huddersfield in
he has been recognised several times for particular works
the atlantic ocean is the second largest of the worlds oceans that separates the old world from the new world
an algebraic number is a number that is a root of a non zero polynomial in one variable with integer coefficients
for example the golden ratio formula is an algebraic number because it is a root of the polynomial
that is it is a value for x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero
as another example the complex number formula is algebraic because it is a root of
all integers and rational numbers are algebraic as are all roots of integers
real and complex numbers that are not algebraic such as pi and are called transcendental numbers
the set of algebraic numbers is countably infinite and has measure zero in the lebesgue measure as a subset of the uncountable complex numbers
in that sense almost all complex numbers are transcendental
the sum difference product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic as can be demonstrated by using the resultant and algebraic numbers thus form a field formula
every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are algebraic numbers is again algebraic
that can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed
in fact it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals and so it is called the algebraic closure of the rationals
the set of real algebraic numbers itself forms a field
any number that can be obtained from the integers using a finite number of additions subtractions multiplications divisions and taking th roots where is a positive integer are algebraic
the converse however is not true there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner
these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree or higher a result of galois theory
for example the equation has a unique real root that cannot be expressed in terms of only radicals and arithmetic operations
algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials starting from the rational numbers
one may generalize this to closed form numbers which may be defined in various ways
most broadly all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms are called elementary numbers and these include the algebraic numbers plus some transcendental numbers
most narrowly one may consider numbers explicitly defined in terms of polynomials exponentials and logarithms this does not include all algebraic numbers but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as or ln
an algebraic integer is an algebraic number that is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient
examples of algebraic integers are formula formula and formula therefore the algebraic integers constitute a proper superset of the integers as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials for all formula
in this sense algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers
the sum difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers which means that the algebraic integers form a ring
the name algebraic integer comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers and because the algebraic integers in any number field are in many ways analogous to the integers
if is a number field its ring of integers is the subring of algebraic integers in and is frequently denoted as
these are the prototypical examples of dedekind domains
in mathematics an automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself
it is in some sense a symmetry of the object and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure
the set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group called the automorphism group
it is loosely speaking the symmetry group of the object
in the context of abstract algebra a mathematical object is an algebraic structure such as a group ring or vector space
an automorphism is simply a bijective homomorphism of an object with itself
the identity morphism is called the trivial automorphism in some contexts
respectively other automorphisms are called nontrivial automorphisms
the exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of mathematical object in question and what precisely constitutes an isomorphism of that object
the most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called category theory
category theory deals with abstract objects and morphisms between those objects
in category theory an automorphism is an endomorphism which is also an isomorphism
this is a very abstract definition since in category theory morphisms are not necessarily functions and objects are not necessarily sets
in most concrete settings however the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure
if the automorphisms of an object form a set then they form a group under composition of morphisms
this group is called the automorphism group of
the automorphism group of an object x in a category c is denoted autc or simply aut if the category is clear from context
so that formula is a new fifth root of unity connected with the former fifth root formula by relations of perfect reciprocity
in some categories notably groups rings and lie algebras it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types called inner and outer automorphisms
in the case of groups the inner automorphisms are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself
for each element a of a group g conjugation by a is the operation given by
one can easily check that conjugation by a is a group automorphism
the inner automorphisms form a normal subgroup of aut denoted by inn this is called goursats lemma
the other automorphisms are called outer automorphisms
the quotient group is usually denoted by out the non trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms
the same definition holds in any unital ring or algebra where a is any invertible element
for lie algebras the definition is slightly different
accordions are a family of box shaped musical instruments of the bellows driven free reed aerophone type
the essential characteristic of the accordion is to combine in one instrument a melody section also called the diskant usually on the right hand manual with an accompaniment or basso continuo functionality on the left hand
the musician normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right hand side and the accompaniment on bass or pre set chord buttons on the left hand side
a person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist
the accordion belongs to the free reed aerophone family
other instruments in this family include the concertina harmonica and bandoneon
the concertina and bandoneon do not have the melody accompaniment duality
the harmoneon is also related and while having the descant vs
melody dualism tries to make it less pronounced
the harmonium and american reed organ are in the same family but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on a surface or the floor
the accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or keys causing pallets to open which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel called reeds
these vibrate to produce sound inside the body
valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instruments reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block
the accordion is widely spread across the world because of the waves of migration from europe to the americas and other regions
in some countries it is used in popular music whereas in other regions it tends to be more used for dance pop and folk music
in europe and north america some popular music acts also make use of the instrument
additionally the accordion is used in cajun zydeco jazz and klezmer music and in both solo and orchestral performances of classical music
the piano accordion is the official city instrument of san francisco california united states
many conservatories in europe have classical accordion departments
the oldest name for this group of instruments is harmonika from the greek meaning harmonic musical
today native versions of the name accordion are more common
these names refer to the type of accordion patented by cyrill demian which concerned automatically coupled chords on the bass side
the accordions basic form is believed to have been invented in berlin in by christian friedrich ludwig buschmann although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier
the earliest history of the accordion in russia is poorly documented
nevertheless according to russian researchers the earliest known simple accordions were made in tula russia by ivan sizov and timofey vorontsov around after they received an early accordion from germany
by the late s the instrument was already very widespread together the factories of the two masters were producing instruments a year
by over instruments were being produced yearly by tula and neighbouring villages and by the yearly production was over
by the s novgorod vyatka and saratov governorates also had significant accordion production
by the s the list included oryol ryazan moscow tver vologda kostroma nizhny novgorod and simbirsk and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument
the accordion is one of several european inventions of the early th century that use free reeds driven by a bellows
an instrument called accordion was first patented in by cyrill demian of armenian origin in vienna
demians instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments
it only had a left hand buttonboard with the right hand simply operating the bellows
one key feature for which demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key
his instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key one for each bellows direction
at that time in vienna mouth harmonicas with kanzellen had already been available for many years along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows
the diatonic key arrangement was also already in use on mouth blown instruments
demians patent thus covered an accompanying instrument an accordion played with the left hand opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing
the patent also described instruments with both bass and sections although demian preferred the bass only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages
the accordion was introduced from germany into britain in about the year
the instrument was noted in the times in as one new to british audiences and was not favourably reviewed but nevertheless it soon became popular
it had also become popular with new yorkers by the mid s
after demians invention other accordions appeared some featuring only the right handed keyboard for playing melodies
it took english inventor charles wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox
his patent for what he called a concertina also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool
the austrian musician adolf mller described a great variety of instruments in his book
at the time vienna and london had a close musical relationship with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year so it is possible that wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key arrangement ideas into practice
jeunes flutina resembles wheatstones concertina in internal construction and tone colour but it appears to complement demians accordion functionally
the flutina is a one sided bisonoric melody only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left
when the two instruments are combined the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today
further innovations followed and continue to the present
various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed as well as voicings with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance and different methods of internal construction to improve tone stability and durability
modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls so that the accordion can be plugged into a pa system or keyboard amplifier for live shows
some s era accordions may incorporate midi sensors and circuitry enabling the accordion to be plugged into a synth module and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds such as piano or organ
accordions have many configurations and types
what may be easy to do with one type of accordion could be technically challenging or impossible with another and proficiency with one layout may not translate to another
the most obvious difference between accordions is their right hand sides
piano accordions use a piano style musical keyboard button accordions use a buttonboard
button accordions are furthermore differentiated by their usage of a chromatic or diatonic buttonboard for the right hand side
accordions may be either bisonoric producing different pitches depending on the direction of bellows movement or unisonoric producing the same pitch in both directions
piano accordions are unisonoric
chromatic button accordions also tend to be unisonoric while diatonic button accordions tend to be bisonoric though notable exceptions exist
accordion size is not standardized and may vary significantly from model to model
accordions vary not only in their dimensions and weight but also in number of buttons or keys present in the right and left hand manuals
for example piano accordions may have as few as bass buttons or up to or beyond
accordions also vary by their available registers and by their specific tuning and voicing
despite these differences all accordions share a number of common components
the bellows is the most recognizable part of the instrument and the primary means of articulation
the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the bellows by the player
in a sense the role of the bellows can be compared to the role of moving a violins bow on bowed strings
for a more direct analogy the bellows can be compared to the role of breathing for a singer
the bellows is located between the right and left hand manuals and is made from pleated layers of cloth and cardboard with added leather and metal
it is used to create pressure and vacuum driving air across the internal reeds and producing sound by their vibrations applied pressure increases the volume
the keyboard touch is not expressive and does not affect dynamics all expression is effected through the bellows
bellows effects include the accordions body consists of two boxes commonly made of wood joined by the bellows
these boxes house reed chambers for the right and left hand manuals
each side has grilles in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument and to allow the sound to project
the grille for the right hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes
the right hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left hand manual for playing the accompaniment however skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand
the size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type layout and playing range which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single octave on the right hand manual to the most common bass accordion and through to large and heavy bass free bass converter models
the accordion is an aerophone
the manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow or disables it the term accordion covers a wide range of instruments with varying components
all instruments have reed ranks of some format apart from reedless digital accordions
not all have switches to change registers or ranks as some have only one treble register and one bass register
the most typical accordion is the piano accordion which is used for many musical genres
another type of accordion is the button accordion which is used in musical traditions including cajun conjunto and tejano music swiss and slovenian austro german alpine music and argentinian tango music
the helikon style accordion has multiple flared horns projecting out of the left side to strengthen the bass tone
the word helikon refers to a deep pitched tuba
different systems exist for the right hand manual of an accordion which is normally used for playing the melody
some use a button layout arranged in one way or another while others use a piano style keyboard
each system has different claimed benefits by those who prefer it
they are also used to define one accordion or another as a different type different systems are also in use for the left hand manual which is normally used for playing the accompaniment
these usually use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing
there are three general categories inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones
these are organized in different sounding banks which can be further combined into registers producing differing timbres
all but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate organized from high to low registers
each register stop produces a separate sound timbre many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined
see the accordion reed ranks and switches article for further explanation and audio samples
all but the smaller accordions usually have treble switches
the larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side
in describing or pricing an accordion the first factor is size expressed in number of keys on either side
for a piano type this could for one example be meaning treble keys on the treble side and bass keys
a second aspect of size is the width of the white keys which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths ranging from for a childs accordion to for an adult sized instrument
after size the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side either on a cassotto or not and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches
the next but important factor is the quality of the reeds the highest grade called a mano the next tipo a mano lower grades including export and several more
price is also affected by the use of costly woods luxury decorations and features such as a palm switch grille mute and so on
some accordion makers sell a range of different models from a less expensive base model to a more costly luxury model
typically the register switches are described as reeds meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass and registers m meaning register buttons on the treble side plus a special master that activates all ranks like the tutti or full organ switch on an organ and seven register switches on the bass side
another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics such as condenser microphones volume and tone controls or midi sensors and connections
the larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller squeezeboxes and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting and avoid dropping the instrument while standing
other accordions such as the diatonic button accordion have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap
all accordions have a leather strap on the left hand manual to keep the players hand in position while drawing the bellows
there are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing
in the s a range of electronic and digital accordions were introduced
they have an electronic sound module which creates the accordion sound and most use midi systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module
a digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds which can include different types of accordions and even non accordion sounds such as pipe organ piano or guitar
sensors are used on the buttons and keys such as magnetic reed switches
sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module
digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments such as a piano style sustain pedal a modulation control for changing keys and a portamento effect
as an electronic instrument these types of accordions are plugged into a pa system or keyboard amplifier to produce sound
some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier so they can be used without a pa system or keyboard amplifier at least for practicing and small venues like coffeehouses
one benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones making them inaudible to other people nearby
on a digital accordion the volume of the right hand keyboard and the left hand buttons can be independently adjusted
acoustic digital hybrid accordions also exist
they are acoustic accordions but they also contain sensors electronics and midi connections which provides a wider range of sound options
an acoustic digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added
several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians because of the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion
various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions
many remain curiosities only a few have remained in use the most expensive accordions are typically fully hand made particularly the reeds completely hand made reeds have a better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured ones
some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low end instruments such as the ones improved by yutaka usui a japanese craftsman
the manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process
in a sense all accordions are handmade since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required
the general process involves making the individual parts assembling the subsections assembling the entire instrument and final decorating and packaging
notable centres of production are the italian cities of stradella and castelfidardo with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter
castelfidardo honours the memory of paolo soprani who was one of the first large scale producers
maugein freres has built accordions in the french town of tulle since and the company is now the last complete process manufacturer of accordions in france
german companies such as hohner and weltmeister made large numbers of accordions but production diminished by the end of the th century
hohner still manufactures its top end models in germany and weltmeister instruments are still handmade by harmona akkordeon gmbh in klingenthal
the accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or ethnic music popular music and transcriptions from the operatic and light classical music repertoire
it was also used by the kikuyu tribe in kenya and is the main instrument in the traditional mwomboko dance
today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles such as rock and pop rock and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts as well as advertisements
the accordions popularity spread rapidly it has mostly been associated with the common people and was propagated by europeans who emigrated around the world
the accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians and has been integrated into traditional music styles all over the world see the list of music styles that incorporate the accordion
early jazz accordionists include charles melrose who recorded wailing blues barrel house stomp with the cellar boys buster moten who played second piano and accordion in the bennie moten orchestra and jack cornell who did recordings with irving mills
later jazz accordionists from the united states include steve bach milton delugg orlando digirolamo dominic frontiere guy klucevsek yuri lemeshev frank marocco john serry sr lee tomboulian and art van damme
french jazz accordionists include richard galliano bernard lubat and vincent peirani
norwegian jazz accordionists include asmund bjrken stian carstensen gabriel fliflet frode haltli and eivin one pedersen
the constraints of the stradella bass system limiting the left hand to preset chord buttons is a barrier to some jazz chord conventions
jazz accordionists expand the range of chord possibilities by using more than one chord button simultaneously or by using combinations of a chord button and a bass note other than the typical root of the chord
an example of the former technique is used to play a minor seventh chord
to play an a minor seventh chord the a minor and e minor preset buttons are pressed simultaneously along with an a bassnote
an example of the latter technique is used to play the half diminished chord
to play an e half diminished seventh chord a g minor preset button is pressed along with an e bassnote
for the left hand the free bass system is used in jazz as a means of creating complex chord voicings
jazz harmony that would otherwise be difficult to replicate with the stradella bass system such as tritone substitutions become more accessible using a free bass accordion
the accordion appeared in popular music from the s to the s
this half century is often called the golden age of the accordion
five players pietro frosini the two brothers count guido deiro and pietro deiro and slovenian brothers vilko ovsenik and slavko avsenik charles magnante were major influences at this time
most vaudeville theaters closed during the great depression but accordionists during the s s taught and performed for radio
included among this group was the concert virtuoso john serry sr during the s through the s the accordion received significant exposure on television with performances by myron floren on the lawrence welk show
in the late s and early s the accordion declined in popularity because of the rise of rock and roll
the first accordionist to appear and perform at the newport jazz festival was angelo dipippo
he can be seen playing his accordion in the motion picture the godfather
he also composed and performed with his accordion on part of the soundtrack of woody allens movie to rome with love
he was featured twice on the tonight show with johnny carson
richard galliano is an internationally known accordionist whose repertoire covers jazz tango nuevo latin and classical
some popular bands use the instrument to create distinctive sounds
a notable example is grammy award winning parodist weird al yankovic who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks particularly his polkas
yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child
the accordion has also been used in the rock genre most notably by john linnell of they might be giants featuring more prominently in the bands earlier works
the instrument is still frequently used during live performances and continues to make appearances in their studio albums
accordion is also used in the music of the dropkick murphys and gogol bordello
accordionists in heavy metal music make their most extensive appearances in the folk metal subgenre and are otherwise generally rare
full time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer but they are still utilized for studio work as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances
the finnish symphonic folk metal band turisas used to have a full time accordionist employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist
one of their accordionists netta skog is now a member of ensiferum another folk metal band
another finnish metal band korpiklaani invokes a type of finnish polka called humppa and also has a full time accordionist
sarah kiener the former hurdy gurdy player for the swiss melodic death folk metal band eluveitie played a helvetic accordion known as a zugerrgeli
although best known as a folk instrument it has grown in popularity among classical composers
the earliest surviving concert piece is written in by louise reisner of paris
other composers including the russian pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky the italian umberto giordano and the american charles ives wrote works for the diatonic button accordion
the first composer to write specifically for the chromatic accordion was paul hindemith
in the austrian alban berg included an accordion in wozzeck op
in the first accordion concerto was composed in russia
other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the th century
included among this group was the italian american john serry sr whose concerto for free bass accordion was completed in
in addition the american accordionist robert davine composed his divertimento for flute clarinet bassoon and accordion as a work for chamber orchestra
american composer william p
perry featured the accordion in his orchestral suite six title themes in search of a movie

luciano berio wrote sequenza xiii for accordionist teodoro anzellotti
accordionists like mogens ellegaard joseph macerollo nick ariondo friedrich lips hugo noth stefan hussong teodoro anzellotti and geir draugsvoll encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion and also started playing baroque music on the free bass accordion
french composer henri dutilleux used an accordion in both his late song cycles correspondances and le temps lhorloge
russian born composer sofia gubaidulina has composed solos concertos and chamber works for accordion
astor piazzollas concert tangos are performed widely
piazzolla performed on the bandoneon but his works are performed on either bandoneon or accordion
the earliest mention of the novel accordion instrument in australian music occurs in the s
the accordion initially competed against cheaper and more convenient reed instruments such as mouth organ concertina and melodeon
frank fracchia was an australian accordion composer and copies of his works my dear can you come out tonight and dancing with you are preserved in australian libraries
other australian composers who arranged music for accordion include reginald stoneham
the popularity of the accordion peaked in the late s and continued until the s
the accordion was particularly favoured by buskers
the accordion is a traditional instrument in bosnia and herzegovina
it is the dominant instrument used in sevdalinka a traditional genre of folk music from bosnia and herzegovina
it is also considered a national instrument of the country
the accordion was brought to brazil by settlers and immigrants from europe especially from italy and germany who mainly settled in the south
the first instrument brought was a concertina
the instrument was popular in the s and it was common to find several accordions in the same house
there are many different configurations and tunes which were adapted from the cultures that came from europe
accordion is the official symbol instrument of the rio grande do sul state where was voted by unanimity in the deputy chamber
during the boom of accordions there were around factories in brazil where most of them in the south in rio grande do sul state with only outside the south
one of the most famous and genuinely brazilian brands was acordees todeschini from bento gonalves rs closed in
the todeschini accordion is very appreciated today and survives with very few maintainers
the most notable musicians of button accordions are renato borghetti adelar bertussi albino manique and edson dutra
compared to many other countries the instrument is very popular in mainstream pop music
in some parts of the country such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument
as opposed to most european folk accordions a very dry tuning is usually used in brazil
outside the south the accordion is used in almost all styles of forr as the principal instrument luiz gonzaga and dominguinhos being among the notable musicians in this style from the northeast
in this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion triangle and zabumba
this style has gained popularity recently in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country
moreover the accordion is the principal instrument in junina music with mario zan having been a very important exponent of this music
it is an important instrument in sertanejo music which originated in the midwest and southeast of brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country
the accordion is also a traditional instrument in colombia commonly associated with the vallenato and cumbia genres
the accordion has been used by tropipop musicians such as carlos vives andrs cabas fonseca and bacilos as well as rock musicians such as juanes and pop musicians as shakira
vallenato who emerged in the early twentieth century in valledupar and have come to symbolize the folk music of colombia
every year in april colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country the vallenato legend festival
the festival holds contests for best accordion player
once every decade the king of kings accordion competition takes place where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player the pilonera mayor prize
this is the worlds largest competitive accordion festival
accordion is often played at traditional czech pubs such as u flek prague
norteo heavily relies on the accordion it is a genre related to polka
ramn ayala known in mexico as the king of the accordion is a norteo musician
cumbia which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as celso pia creating a more contemporary style
us born mexican musician julieta venegas incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock pop and folk
she was influenced by her fellow chicanos los lobos who also use the music of the accordion
according to barbara demick in nothing to envy the accordion is known as the peoples instrument and all north korean teachers were expected to learn the accordion
the number of accordionists in china exceeds every other country in the world and possibly every country combined
introduced in the accordion has risen to popularity in china throughout the years thanks to russian teachers and its being a popular instrument in the peoples liberation army and remains popular
artificial intelligence is the intelligence of machines or softwares as opposed to the intelligence of human beings or animals
ai applications include advanced web search engines recommendation systems understanding human speech self driving cars generative or creative tools and competing at the highest level in strategic games
artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism followed by disappointment and the loss of funding followed by new approaches success and renewed funding
ai research has tried and discarded many different approaches including simulating the brain modeling human problem solving formal logic large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior
in the first decades of the st century highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field and this technique has proved highly successful helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia
the various sub fields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools
the traditional goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge representation planning learning natural language processing perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects
general intelligence is among the fields long term goals
to solve these problems ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem solving techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics probability and economics
ai also draws upon computer science psychology linguistics philosophy and many other fields
the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
this raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human like intelligence these issues have previously been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity
computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that ai may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards goals beneficial to humankind
economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment
the term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping ais true technological capabilities
artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity and have been common in fiction as in mary shelleys frankenstein or karel apeks rur these characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence
the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity
the study of mathematical logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as and could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction
this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church turing thesis
this along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology information theory and cybernetics led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain
the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts formal design for turing complete artificial neurons
the field of ai research was born at a workshop at dartmouth college in
the attendees became the founders and leaders of ai research
they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english
by the middle of the s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense and laboratories had been established around the world
researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field
herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do
marvin minsky agreed writing within a generation
the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved
they had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks
progress slowed and in in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai
early research into artificial neural networks was discredited by minskys and paperts book perceptrons which was perceived as proving that this technology would never work
the next few years would later be called an ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult
in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts
by the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars
at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research
however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer lasting winter began
many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition
a number of researchers began to look into sub symbolic approaches to specific ai problems
robotics researchers such as rodney brooks rejected symbolic ai and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move survive and learn their environment
tools were invented that could make reasonable guesses and deal with uncertain information
interest in neural networks and connectionism was revived by geoffrey hinton david rumelhart and others in the middle of the s
connectionism began to succeed in the s when yann lecun successfully showed convolutional neural networks could recognize handwritten digits
ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems
this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields
by solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence
several leading academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines
this concern has led to the founding of the subfield of artificial general intelligence which had several well funded institutions by the s
deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks in
deep learnings success depended on hardware improvements and access to large amounts of data
it soon proved to be highly successful at a wide range of tasks and was adopted throughout the field
for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned
the success of deep learning set off an explosion of interest and investment throughout the economy
the number of software projects that use ai at google increased from a sporadic usage in to more than projects in
in a survey one in five companies reported they had incorporated ai in some offerings or processes
the amount of research into ai increased by in the years
according to ai impacts at stanford around about billion annually is invested in artificial intelligence in the us and about of new us computer science phd graduates have specialized in artificial intelligence about ai related us job openings existed in
in issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at ai conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers re focussed their careers on these issues
the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study
the general problem of simulating intelligence has been broken down into sub problems
these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display
the traits described below have received the most attention
early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step by step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions
by the late s and s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics
many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a combinatorial explosion they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger
even humans rarely use the step by step deduction that early ai research could model
they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments
knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real world facts
a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them
the most general ontologies are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain
ai research building on the work of mathematics and philosophy have developed tools to represent specific domains such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge and default reasoning
among the most difficult problems in ai are the breadth of commonsense knowledge is enormous and the sub symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge
formal knowledge representations are used in content based indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery and other areas
machine learning a fundamental concept of ai research since the fields inception is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance
supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first and comes in two main varieties classification and regression
classification is used to determine what category something belongs in the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs
regression is the attempt to produce a numeric function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change
both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as function approximators trying to learn an unknown function for example a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories spam or not spam
in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones
the agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space
transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem
computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity or by other notions of optimization
natural language processing allows machines to read and understand human language
a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human written sources such as newswire texts
some straightforward applications of nlp include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering
starting in the s symbolic ai used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic
this failed to produce useful applications due to the intractability of logic and the breadth of commonsense knowledge
modern techniques include word embedding keyword spotting and transformer based deep learning and others
in generative pre trained transformer language models began to generate coherent text and by these models were able to get human level scores on the bar exam sat gre and many other real world applications
machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors showed the most promise
ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions
reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule
planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means ends analysis
robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space
simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space quickly grows to astronomical numbers
the result is a search that is too slow or never completes
the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps
in some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal
heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies
heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size
a very different kind of search came to prominence in the s based on the mathematical theory of optimization
for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made
these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top
other related optimization algorithms include random optimization beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing
evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search
for example they may begin with a population of organisms and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation
classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming
alternatively distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms
two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization
logic is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well
for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning and inductive logic programming is a method for learning
several different forms of logic are used in ai research
propositional logic involves truth functions such as or and not
first order logic adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other
fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth to vague statements such as alice is old that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false
default logics non monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem
several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus causal calculus belief calculus and modal logics
logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi agent systems have also been designed such as paraconsistent logics
many problems in ai require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information
ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics
bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for various problems including reasoning learning planning and perception
probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time
a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent
precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory
these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design
the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers and controllers
controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems
classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match
they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai
these examples are known as observations or patterns
in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class
a class is a decision that has to be made
all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set
when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience
a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches
the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm
k nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mid s
kernel methods such as the support vector machine displaced k nearest neighbor in the s
the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability
neural networks are also used for classification
classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified such as the dataset size distribution of samples across classes dimensionality and the level of noise
model based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data
otherwise if no matching model is available and if accuracy is the sole concern conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers tend to be more accurate than model based classifiers such as naive bayes on most practical data sets
neural networks were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain
a simple neuron n accepts input from other neurons each of which when activated casts a weighted vote for or against whether neuron n should itself activate
learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data one simple algorithm is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another
neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation in addition neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes
modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data
they can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations
neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization they perform gradient descent on a multi dimensional topology that was created by training the network
the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm
other learning techniques for neural networks are hebbian learning gmdh or competitive learning
the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks
among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi layer perceptrons and radial basis networks
deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs
the multiple layers can progressively extract higher level features from the raw input
for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces
deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition image classification and others
deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers
in a convolutional layer each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neurons receptive field
this can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex
in a recurrent neural network the signal will propagate through a layer more than once thus an rnn is an example of deep learning
rnns can be trained by gradient descent however long term gradients which are back propagated can vanish or explode known as the vanishing gradient problem
the long short term memory technique can prevent this in most cases
specialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed such as lisp prolog tensorflow and many others
hardware developed for ai includes ai accelerators and neuromorphic computing
by graphics processing units often with ai specific enhancements had displaced central processing unit as the dominant means to train large scale commercial cloud ai
ai is relevant to any intellectual task
modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here
frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect
in the s ai applications were at the heart of the most commercially successful areas of computing and have become a ubiquitous feature of daily life
ai is used in search engines targeting online advertisements recommendation systems driving internet traffic targeted advertising virtual assistants autonomous vehicles automatic language translation facial recognition image labeling spam filtering and chatbots
there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions
a few examples are energy storage deepfakes medical diagnosis military logistics foreign policy or supply chain management
game playing has been a test of ais strength since the s
deep blue became the first computer chess playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on may
in in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin
in march alphago won out of games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps
then it defeated ke jie in who at the time continuously held the world no
ranking for two years
other programs handle imperfect information games such as for poker at a superhuman level pluribus and cepheus
deepmind in the s developed a generalized artificial intelligence that could learn many diverse atari games on its own
deepminds alphafold demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein
other applications predict the result of judicial decisions create art and prove mathematical theorems
generative ai gained widespread prominence in the s
large language model systems such as gpt with billion parameters matched human performance on pre existing benchmarks albeit without the system attaining a commonsense understanding of the contents of the benchmarks
a pew research poll conducted in march found that of americans adults had tried chatgpt a large language model fine tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback
while estimates varied wildly goldman sachs suggested in that generative language ai could increase global gdp by in the next ten years
in the increasing realism and ease of use of ai based text to image generators such as midjourney dall e and stable diffusion sparked a trend of viral ai generated photos
widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of pope francis wearing a white puffer coat the fictional arrest of donald trump and a hoax of an attack on the pentagon as well as the usage in professional creative arts
ai interactive systems can improve the information exchange between physicians and patients in clinical settings with a focus on patiens with long term and chronic conditions specifically migraine patients
in wipo reported that ai was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents the internet of things was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size
it was followed again in market size by big data technologies robotics ai d printing and the fifth generation of mobile services
since ai emerged in the s ai related patent applications were filed by innovators and million scientific papers have been published by researchers with the majority of all ai related patent filings published since
companies represent out of the top ai patent applicants with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four
the ratio of scientific papers to inventions has significantly decreased from in to in which is attributed to be indicative of a shift from theoretical research to the use of ai technologies in commercial products and services
machine learning is the dominant ai technique disclosed in patents and is included in more than one third of all identified inventions with computer vision being the most popular functional application
ai related patents not only disclose ai techniques and applications they often also refer to an application field or industry
twenty application fields were identified in and included in order of magnitude telecommunications transportation life and medical sciences and personal devices computing and human computer interaction
other sectors included banking entertainment security industry and manufacturing agriculture and networks
ibm has the largest portfolio of ai patents with patent applications followed by microsoft with patent applications
alan turing wrote in i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour
he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation
since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind
turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks russell and norvig agree with turing that ai must be defined in terms of acting and not thinking
however they are critical that the test compares machines to people
aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons
ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence
mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world
another ai founder marvin minsky similarly defines it as the ability to solve hard problems
these definitions view intelligence in terms of well defined problems with well defined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machine and no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible
a definition that has also been adopted by google major practitionary in the field of ai
this definition stipulated the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence
no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history
the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches
this approach is mostly sub symbolic neat soft and narrow
critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers
symbolic ai simulated the high level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics
they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests
in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action
however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning
moravecs paradox is the discovery that high level intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult
philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge
although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree
the issue is not resolved sub symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias
critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because sub symbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision
the emerging field of neuro symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches
neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles
scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems
neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely only on incremental testing to see if they work
this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant
in the s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm a transition that russell and norvig termed in as the victory of the neats
however in they wrote deep learning may represent a resurgence of the scruffies
modern ai has elements of both
finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems
soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation
soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks
ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields long term goals
general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions
the experimental sub field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively
the philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do
this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior
mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field
stuart russell and peter norvig observe that most ai researchers dont care about the of ai as long as the program works they dont care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence
however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind
it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction
david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness
the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior
the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something
human information processing is easy to explain however human subjective experience is difficult to explain
for example it is easy to imagine a color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like
computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing
computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind body problem
this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam
philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds
searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind
if a machine has a mind and subjective experience then it may also have sentience and if so it could also suffer it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights
any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights
this issue has been considered in fiction for centuries and is now being considered by for example californias institute for the future however critics argue that the discussion is premature
a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind
if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself
the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self improvement
its intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans
science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario the singularity
because it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable
robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either
this idea called transhumanism has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger
edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines as far back as and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in
in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai
a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in long term unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed
risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated of us jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only of us jobs as high risk
the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology creates unemployment
unlike previous waves of automation many middle class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in that the worry that ai could do to white collar jobs what steam power did to blue collar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously
jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for care related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy
ai provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments smart spyware face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect deepfakes aid in producing misinformation advanced ai can make centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets
terrorists criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized ai such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons
by over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots
machine learning ai is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours
ai programs can become biased after learning from real world data
it may not be introduced by the system designers but learned by the program and thus the programmers may not be aware that the bias exists
bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed
it can also emerge from correlations ai is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group
in some cases this assumption may be unfair
an example of this is compas a commercial program widely used by us courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist
propublica claims that the compas assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants
health equity issues may also be exacerbated when many to many mapping is done without taking steps to ensure equity for populations at risk for bias
at this time equity focused tools and regulations are not in place to ensure equity application representation and usage
other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when ai is used for credit rating cv screening hiring and applications for public housing
at its conference on fairness accountability and transparency the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings recommending that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of self learning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed
it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it
this could as the physicist stephen hawking puts it spell the end of the human race
according to the philosopher nick bostrom for almost any goals that a sufficiently intelligent ai may have it is instrumentally incentivized to protect itself from being shut down and to acquire more resources as intermediary steps to better achieve these goals
sentience or emotions are then not required for an advanced ai to be dangerous
in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side
the political scientist charles t
rubin argued that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence and warned that we should not be confident that intelligent machines will by default treat us favorably
the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai
personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates elon musk have expressed concern about existential risk from ai
in ai pioneers including geoffrey hinton yoshua bengio demis hassabis and sam altman issued the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war some others such as yann lecun consider this to be unfounded
mark zuckerberg stated that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans
some experts have argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine
rodney brooks in particular said in that malevolent ai is still centuries away
in order to leverage as large a dataset as is feasible generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under a rationale of fair use
experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work
friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans
eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk
machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions
the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas
the field of machine ethics is also called computational morality and was founded at an aaai symposium in
other approaches include wendell wallachs artificial moral agents and stuart j
russells three principles for developing provably beneficial machines
the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms
the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally
according to ai index at stanford the annual number of ai related laws passed in the survey countries jumped from one passed in to passed in alone
between and more than countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai
most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates us and vietnam
others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia
the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology
henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november calling for a government commission to regulate ai
in openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than years
in a ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country of chinese citizens but only of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks
a reuters ipsos poll found that of americans agree and disagree that ai poses risks to humanity
in a fox news poll of americans thought it very important and an additional thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus responding not very important and responding not at all important
thought capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction
a common trope in these works began with mary shelleys frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters
this includes such works as and with hal the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator and the matrix
in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still and bishop from aliens are less prominent in popular culture
isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many books and stories most notably the multivac series about a super intelligent computer of the same name
asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity
several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer
this appears in karel apeks rur the films ai artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k
dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence

their albums have been released through peter gabriels real world records and they have frequently performed at womad festivals worldwide
their sales on the label are exceeded only by gabriel himself
their recording contract with real world was for five albums of which volume anatomic was the last
after a number of festival dates in the band went on hiatus
in they regrouped to play a number of shows releasing a re mastered retrospective titled capture
on may afro celt sound system announced the release of the album born
in january a posting to that website revealed that due to a dispute with emmerson who announced his departure from the band in there were two active versions of the band a version led by emmerson and a separate line up headed by james mcnally and martin russell
emmersons version of the band released the album the source in
the dispute ended on december with an announcement on social media
the band released their seventh studio album flight on november
the inspiration behind the project dates back to when simon emmerson a grammy award nominated british producer and guitarist collaborated with afro pop star baaba maal
while making an album with maal in senegal emmerson was struck by the similarity between one african melody and a traditional irish air
back in london irish musician davy spillane told emmerson about a belief that nomadic celts lived in africa or india before they migrated to western europe
whether or not the theory was true emmerson was intrigued by the two regions musical affinities
in an experiment that would prove successful emmerson brought two members of baaba maals band together with traditional irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create
adding a dash of modern sound emmerson also brought in english dance mixers for an electronic beat
people thought i was mad when i touted the idea emmerson told jim carroll of the irish times
at the time i was out of favour with the london club scene
i was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary
jamming in the studios at real world musician peter gabriels recording facilities in wiltshire england the group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week
this album was released by real world records in and marked the debut of the afro celt sound system
prior to that first album being made none of us knew if it would work musician james mcnally told larry katz of the boston herald
we were strangers who didnt even speak the same language
but we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language
mcnally who grew up second generation irish in london played whistles keyboards piano bodhran and bamboo flute
sound magic has now sold over copies
the band performed at festivals raves and dance clubs and regularly included two african musicians moussa sissokho on talking drum and djembe and nfaly kouyate on vocals kora and balafon
just as the second album was getting off the ground one of the groups core musicians year old keyboardist jo bruce died suddenly of an asthma attack
the band was devastated and the album was put on hold
sinad oconnor then collaborated with the band and helped them cope with their loss
blew into the studio on a windy november night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful mcnally told katz
we had this track we didnt know what to do with
sinad scribbled a few lyrics and bang she left us completely choked up
the band used the name of oconnors song release for the title of their album
was released in and by the spring of it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide
release is also used as one of the gcse music set works in the uk that students are required to study for their exam
in the group was nominated for a grammy award in the best world music category
the band composed at the time of eight members from six countries took pride in its ability to bring people together through music
we can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that were at home mcnally told patrick macdonald of the seattle times
were breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music
we leave a door open to communicate with each others traditions
and its changed our lives
in the group released which climbed to number one on billboards top world music albums chart
featuring guest spots by peter gabriel and robert plant the album also incorporated a heightened african sound
on the first two records the pendulum swung more toward the celtic london club side of the equation emmerson told the irish times carroll
for this one we wanted to have more african vocals and input than wed done before
again the afro celt sound system met with success
chuck taylor of billboard praised the album as a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music
the single when youre falling with vocals by gabriel became a radio hit in the united states
in for the seed album they changed their name to afrocelts
they reverted to the longer band name for their subsequent albums pod a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums and capture
they played a number of shows to promote volume anatomic in and summer ending with a gig in korea before taking an extended break to work on side projects amongst them the imagined village featuring simon emmerson and johnny kalsi
starting in the summer of the band performed a series of live shows to promote capture released on september on real world records
further performances continue to the present day and a new album in progress titled born was announced on their website in
following the split emmersons version of the band released the album the source in
during the band had split into two formations one of them including simon emmerson nfaly kouyate and johnny kalsi the other one james mcnally and martin russell
the split was announced on the bands website in january
the dispute officially ended with an announcement on social media on december
when afro celt sound system formed in the mid s during the real world recording week the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non existent
however over time a combination of people became most often associated with the name afro celt sound system
the divided grouping of the band into two versions both operating under the name afro celt sound system began in january and was resolved in december after mcnally and russell agreed to work under a different name from emmerson
russell mcnally version other musicians who have performed or recorded with afro celt sound system include jimmy mahon demba barry babara bangoura iarla lionird peter gabriel robert plant pete lockett sinad oconnor pina kollar dorothee munyaneza sevara nazarkhan simon massey jesse cook martin hayes eileen ivers mundy mairad n mhaonaigh and ciarn tourish of altan ronan browne michael mcgoldrick myrdhin shooglenifty mairead nesbitt nigel eaton davy spillane jonas bruce heather nova julie murphy and ayub ogada caroline lavelle ross ainslie

this page lists some links to ancient philosophy namely philosophical thought extending as far as early post classical history
genuine philosophical thought depending upon original individual insights arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously
karl jaspers termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the th century bce and concluding around the rd century bce an axial age in human thought
in western philosophy the spread of christianity in the roman empire marked the ending of hellenistic philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of medieval philosophy whereas in the middle east the spread of islam through the arab empire marked the end of old iranian philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of early islamic philosophy
see also christian philosophy see also dualism dualism while there are ancient relations between the indian vedas and the iranian avesta the two main families of the indo iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human beings position in society and their view of mans role in the universe
the first charter of human rights by cyrus the great as understood in the cyrus cylinder is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by zarathustra and developed in zoroastrian schools of thought of the achaemenid era of iranian history
ideas and tenets of zoroastrian schools of early persian philosophy are part of many works written in middle persian and of the extant scriptures of the zoroastrian religion in avestan language
among these are treatises such as the shikand gumanic vichar by mardan farrux ohrmazddadan selections of denkard wizidagh ztspram as well as older passages of the book avesta the gathas which are attributed to zarathustra himself and regarded as his direct teachings
anacharsis see also jewish philosophy the ancient indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions the vedic tradition and the ramaa tradition
indian philosophy begins with the vedas wherein questions pertaining to laws of nature the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked
in the famous rigvedic hymn of creation the poet asks in the vedic view creation is ascribed to the self consciousness of the primeval being
this leads to the inquiry into the one being that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things
cosmic order is termed rta and causal law by karma
nature is taken to have three qualities
jainism and buddhism are continuation of the sramana school of thought
the sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities
they laid stress on philosophical concepts like ahimsa karma jnana samsara and moksa
crvka philosophy also known as lokyata it is a system of hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference
it is named after its founder crvka author of the brhaspatya stras
in classical times these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy
some of the questions asked were chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in china and other countries within the east asian cultural sphere that share a common language including japan korea and vietnam
the hundred schools of thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the th century to bce an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in china
even though this period known in its earlier part as the spring and autumn period and the warring states period in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles it is also known as the golden age of chinese philosophy because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely
the thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced lifestyles and social consciousness up to the present day in east asian countries
the intellectual society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of government war and diplomacy
this period ended with the rise of the qin dynasty and the subsequent purge of dissent
the book of han lists ten major schools they are the founder of the qin dynasty who implemented legalism as the official philosophy quashed mohist and confucianist schools
legalism remained influential until the emperors of the han dynasty adopted daoism and later confucianism as official doctrine
these latter two became the determining forces of chinese thought until the introduction of buddhism
confucianism was particularly strong during the han dynasty whose greatest thinker was dong zhongshu who integrated confucianism with the thoughts of the zhongshu school and the theory of the five elements
he also was a promoter of the new text school which considered confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of china who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the universal peace
in contrast there was an old text school that advocated the use of confucian works written in ancient language that were so much more reliable
in particular they refuted the assumption of confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage but simply a human and mortal
the rd and th centuries saw the rise of the xuanxue also called neo taoism
the most important philosophers of this movement were wang bi xiang xiu and guo xiang
the main question of this school was whether being came before not being
a peculiar feature of these taoist thinkers like the seven sages of the bamboo grove was the concept of feng liu a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse
buddhism arrived in china around the st century ad but it was not until the northern and southern sui and tang dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement
at the beginning it was considered a sort of taoist sect and there was even a theory about laozi founder of taoism who went to india and taught his philosophy to buddha
mahayana buddhism was far more successful in china than its rival hinayana and both indian schools and local chinese sects arose from the th century
two chiefly important monk philosophers were sengzhao and daosheng
but probably the most influential and original of these schools was the chan sect which had an even stronger impact in japan as the zen sect
anaximander was a pre socratic greek philosopher who lived in miletus a city of ionia
he belonged to the milesian school and learned the teachings of his master thales
he succeeded thales and became the second master of that school where he counted anaximenes and arguably pythagoras amongst his pupils
little of his life and work is known today
according to available historical documents he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies although only one fragment of his work remains
fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man
anaximander was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe with a particular interest in its origins claiming that nature is ruled by laws just like human societies and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long
like many thinkers of his time anaximanders philosophy included contributions to many disciplines
in astronomy he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the earth
in physics his postulation that the indefinite was the source of all things led greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction
his knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in greece
he created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography
he was also involved in the politics of miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies
anaximander son of praxiades was born in the third year of the nd olympiad
according to apollodorus of athens greek grammarian of the nd century bc he was sixty four years old during the second year of the th olympiad and died shortly afterwards
establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible since no document provides chronological references
themistius a th century byzantine rhetorician mentions that he was the first of the known greeks to publish a written document on nature
therefore his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose at least in the western world
by the time of plato his philosophy was almost forgotten and aristotle his successor theophrastus and a few doxographers provide us with the little information that remains
however we know from aristotle that thales also from miletus precedes anaximander
it is debatable whether thales actually was the teacher of anaximander but there is no doubt that anaximander was influenced by thales theory that everything is derived from water
one thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient greeks considered anaximander to be from the monist school which began in miletus with thales followed by anaximander and which ended with anaximenes
rd century roman rhetorician aelian depicts anaximander as leader of the milesian colony to apollonia on the black sea coast and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen
indeed various history explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters
it is very likely that leaders of miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colonys allegiance
anaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the persian achaemenid empire
anaximanders theories were influenced by the greek mythical tradition and by some ideas of thales the father of western philosophy as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the near east especially babylon
all these were developed rationally
in his desire to find some universal principle he assumed like traditional religion the existence of a cosmic order and his ideas on this used the old language of myths which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality
this was a common practice for the greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system
some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period in the greek city states
this has given rise to the phrase greek miracle
but if we follow carefully the course of anaximanders ideas we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears
the basic elements of nature which the first greek philosophers believed made up the universe in fact represent the primordial forces imagined in earlier ways of thinking
their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony
in the old cosmogonies hesiod and pherecydes zeus establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony
anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not monarchic but geometric and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe
this is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature
in this space there is isonomy and all the forces are symmetrical and transferable
the decisions are now taken by the assembly of demos in the agora which is lying in the middle of the city
the same rational way of thought led him to introduce the abstract apeiron as an origin of the universe a concept that is probably influenced by the original chaos from which everything else appeared in the mythical greek cosmogony
it also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements
origin then must be something else unlimited in its source that could create without experiencing decay so that genesis would never stop
the refutation attributed to hippolytus of rome and the later th century byzantine philosopher simplicius of cilicia attribute to anaximander the earliest use of the word apeiron to designate the original principle
he was the first philosopher to employ in a philosophical context the term arch which until then had meant beginning or origin
that anaximander called this something by the name of is the natural interpretation of what theophrastos says the current statement that the term was introduced by him appears to be due to a misunderstanding
and hippolytos however is not an independent authority and the only question is what theophrastos wrote
for him it became no longer a mere point in time but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be
the indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in homer and as in xenophanes who said that the earth went down indefinitely ie beyond the imagination or concept of men
nearly all we know of anaximanders system is derived in the last resort from theophrastos who certainly knew his book
he seems once at least to have quoted anaximanders own words and he criticised his style
here are the remains of what he said of him in the first book anaximander of miletos son of praxiades a fellow citizen and associate of thales said that the material cause and first element of things was the infinite he being the first to introduce this name of the material cause
he says it is neither water nor any other of the so called elements but a substance different from them which is infinite or from which arise all the heavens and the worlds within them
phys op
burnets quote from the first book is his translation of theophrastos physic opinion fragment as it appears in p
of historia philosophiae graecae by ritter and preller and section of doxographi graeci by diels
by ascribing the infinite with a material cause theophrastos is following the aristotelian tradition of nearly always discussing the facts from the point of view of his own system
aristotle writes that the pre socratics were searching for the element that constitutes all things
while each pre socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless unlimited primordial mass subject to neither old age nor decay that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived
he proposed the theory of the apeiron in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher thales who had claimed that the primary substance was water
the notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and anaximanders description was in terms appropriate to this conception
this arch is called eternal and ageless
refutation iidk baristotle puts things in his own way regardless of historical considerations and it is difficult to see that it is more of an anachronism to call the boundless intermediate between the elements than to say that it is distinct from the elements
indeed if once we introduce the elements at all the former description is the more adequate of the two
at any rate if we refuse to understand these passages as referring to anaximander we shall have to say that aristotle paid a great deal of attention to some one whose very name has been lost and who not only agreed with some of anaximanders views but also used some of his most characteristic expressions
we may add that in one or two places aristotle certainly seems to identify the intermediate with the something distinct from the elements
it is certain that he cannot have said anything about elements which no one thought of before empedokles and no one could think of before parmenides
the question has only been mentioned because it has given rise to a lengthy controversy and because it throws light on the historical value of aristotles statements
from the point of view of his own system these may be justified but we shall have to remember in other cases that when he seems to attribute an idea to some earlier thinker we are not bound to take what he says in an historical sense
for anaximander the principle of things the constituent of all substances is nothing determined and not an element such as water in thales view
neither is it something halfway between air and water or between air and fire thicker than air and fire or more subtle than water and earth
anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature for example water can only be wet never dry and therefore cannot be the one primary substance nor could any of the other candidates
he postulated the apeiron as a substance that although not directly perceptible to us could explain the opposites he saw around him
if thales had been right in saying that water was the fundamental reality it would not be easy to see how anything else could ever have existed
one side of the opposition the cold and moist would have had its way unchecked and the warm and dry would have been driven from the field long ago
we must then have something not itself one of the warring opposites something more primitive out of which they arise and into which they once more pass away
anaximander explains how the four elements of ancient physics are formed and how earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions
unlike other pre socratics he never defines this principle precisely and it has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos
according to him the universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter
it embraces the opposites of hot and cold wet and dry and directs the movement of things an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in all the worlds
anaximander taught then that there was an eternal
the indestructible something out of which everything arises and into which everything returns a boundless stock from which the waste of existence is continually made good elements
that is only the natural development of the thought we have ascribed to thales and there can be no doubt that anaximander at least formulated it distinctly
indeed we can still follow to some extent the reasoning which led him to do so
thales had regarded water as the most likely thing to be that of which all others are forms anaximander appears to have asked how the primary substance could be one of these particular things
his argument seems to be preserved by aristotle who has the following passage in his discussion of the infinite further there cannot be a single simple body which is infinite either as some hold one distinct from the elements which they then derive from it or without this qualification
for there are some who make this
the infinite and not air or water in order that the other things may not be destroyed by their infinity
they are in opposition one to another
air is cold water moist and fire hot
and therefore if any one of them were infinite the rest would have ceased to be by this time
accordingly they say that what is infinite is something other than the elements and from it the elements arise
aristotle physics
f b historia philosophiae graecae section b
anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came
the one surviving fragment of anaximanders writing deals with this matter
simplicius transmitted it as a quotation which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements whence things have their origin thence also their destruction happens according to necessity for they give to each other justice and recompense for their injustice in conformity with the ordinance of time
simplicius mentions that anaximander said all these in poetic terms meaning that he used the old mythical language
the goddess justice keeps the cosmic order
this concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards notably by aristotle and by the greek tragedian euripides what comes from earth must return to earth
friedrich nietzsche in his philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks stated that anaximander viewed
all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance
physicist max born in commenting upon werner heisenbergs arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of quantum mechanics are to be seen as different manifestations different quantum states of one and the same primordial substance proposed that this primordial substance be called apeiron
anaximander was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world
in his model the earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite not supported by anything
it remains in the same place because of its indifference a point of view that aristotle considered ingenious in on the heavens
its curious shape is that of a cylinder with a height one third of its diameter
the flat top forms the inhabited world which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass
carlo rovelli suggests that anaximander took the idea of the earths shape as a floating disk from thales who had imagined the earth floating in water the immense ocean from which everything is born and upon which the earth floats
anaximander was then able to envisage the earth at the centre of an infinite space in which case it required no support as there was nowhere down to fall
in rovellis view the shape a cylinder or a sphere is unimportant compared to the appreciation of a finite body that floats free in space
anaximanders realization that the earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking
karl popper calls this idea one of the boldest most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking
such a model allowed the concept that celestial bodies could pass under the earth opening the way to greek astronomy
rovelli suggests that seeing the stars circling the pole star and both vanishing below the horizon on one side and reappearing above it on the other would suggest to the astronomer that there was a void both above and below the earth
anaximanders bold use of non mythological explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as hesiod
it indicates a pre socratic effort to demystify physical processes
his major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the universe and the origins of life for this he is often called the father of cosmology and founder of astronomy
however pseudo plutarch states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities
he placed the celestial bodies in the wrong order
he thought that the stars were nearest to the earth then the moon and the sun farthest away
his scheme is compatible with the indo iranian philosophical traditions contained in the iranian avesta och the indian upanishads
at the origin after the separation of hot and cold a ball of flame appeared that surrounded earth like bark on a tree
this ball broke apart to form the rest of the universe
it resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels filled with fire with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute
consequently the sun was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the earth on the farthest wheel and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole
the diameter of the solar wheel was twenty seven times that of the earth and the lunar wheel whose fire was less intense eighteen times
its hole could change shape thus explaining lunar phases
the stars and the planets located closer followed the same model
anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the sun as a huge mass and consequently to realize how far from earth it might be and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances
furthermore according to diogenes laertius he built a celestial sphere
this invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the zodiac as the roman philosopher pliny the elder reports in natural history
it is a little early to use the term ecliptic but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the earth to explain the seasons
the doxographer and theologian aetius attributes to pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity
according to simplicius anaximander already speculated on the plurality of worlds similar to atomists leucippus and democritus and later philosopher epicurus
these thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while and that some were born when others perished
they claimed that this movement was eternal for without movement there can be no generation no destruction
in addition to simplicius hippolytus reports anaximanders claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds
cicero writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds
this theory places anaximander close to the atomists and the epicureans who more than a century later also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared
in the timeline of the greek history of thought some thinkers conceptualized a single world while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds continuous or non continuous
anaximander attributed some phenomena such as thunder and lightning to the intervention of elements rather than to divine causes
in his system thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock
thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame but strong enough to produce a sound
a flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls allowing a less active fire to break free
thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow
he saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded earth
a part of that mass evaporated under the suns action thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant
he explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from earth by the sun
for him the earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions which someday would go dry as well
according to aristotles meteorology democritus also shared this opinion
anaximander speculated about the beginnings and origin of animal life and that humans came from other animals in waters
according to his evolutionary theory animals sprang out of the sea long ago born trapped in a spiny bark but as they got older the bark would dry up and animals would be able to break it
as the early humidity evaporated dry land emerged and in time humankind had to adapt
the rd century roman writer censorinus reports anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the earths climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales
he thought that considering humans extended infancy we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently
both strabo and agathemerus claim that according to the geographer eratosthenes anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world
the map probably inspired the greek historian hecataeus of miletus to draw a more accurate version
strabo viewed both as the first geographers after homer
maps were produced in ancient times also notably in egypt lydia the middle east and babylon
only some small examples survived until today
the unique example of a world map comes from late babylonian tablet bm later than th century bc but is based probably on a much older map
these maps indicated directions roads towns borders and geological features
anaximanders innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient greeks
such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears
anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons
first it could be used to improve navigation and trade between miletuss colonies and other colonies around the mediterranean sea and black sea
second thales would probably have found it easier to convince the ionian city states to join in a federation in order to push the median threat away if he possessed such a tool
finally the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one
surely aware of the seas convexity he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface
the centre or navel of the world could have been delphi but is more likely in anaximanders time to have been located near miletus
the aegean sea was near the maps centre and enclosed by three continents themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers
europe was bordered on the south by the mediterranean sea and was separated from asia by the black sea the lake maeotis and further east either by the phasis river or the tanais
the nile flowed south into the ocean separating libya from asia
the suda relates that anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry
it also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in greece of the gnomon
in lacedaemon he participated in the construction or at least in the adjustment of sundials to indicate solstices and equinoxes
indeed a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude
in his time the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane
the position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day
as it moves through its apparent course the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow which is shortest at noon when pointing due south
the variation in the tips position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice
the invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to anaximander because its use as well as the division of days into twelve parts came from the babylonians
it is they according to herodotus histories who gave the greeks the art of time measurement
it is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices because no calculation is necessary
on the other hand equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices as the babylonians thought
as the suda seems to suggest it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry he became the first greek to determine accurately the equinoxes
in his philosophical work de divinatione cicero states that anaximander convinced the inhabitants of lacedaemon to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near
the city collapsed when the top of the taygetus split like the stern of a ship
pliny the elder also mentions this anecdote suggesting that it came from an admirable inspiration as opposed to cicero who did not associate the prediction with divination
rovelli credits anaximander with pioneering the first great scientific revolution in history by introducing the naturalistic approach to understanding the universe according to which the universe operates by inviolable laws without recourse to supernatural explanations
according to rovelli anaximander not only paved the way for modern science but revolutionized the process for how we form our worldview by constantly questioning and rejecting certainty
rovelli further states that anaximander has not been given his due credit largely because his naturalistic approach was strongly opposed in antiquity and had yet to yield the tangible benefits it has today
in the essay collection anaximander in context new studies on the origins of greek philosophy dirk couprie robert hahn and gerald naddaf describe anaximander as one of the greatest minds in history but one that has not been given his due
couprie goes to state that he considers him on par with newton
bertrand russell in the history of western philosophy interprets anaximanders theories as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth fire and water all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others
anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance among these elements that where there was fire ashes now exist
his greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate
friedrich nietzsche in philosophy in the tragic age of the greeks claimed that anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness
in accordance with this anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness
in other words anaximander viewed
all coming to be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being a wrong for which destruction is the only penance
the world of individual objects in this way of thinking has no worth and should perish
martin heidegger lectured extensively on anaximander and delivered a lecture entitled anaximanders saying which was subsequently included in off the beaten track
the lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of being or dasein in the context of the anaximander fragment
heideggers lecture is in turn an important influence on the french philosopher jacques derrida
an architect is a person who plans designs and oversees the construction of buildings
to practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings that have human occupancy or use as their principal purpose
etymologically the term architect derives from the latin which derives from the greek ie chief builder
the professional requirements for architects vary from location to location
an architects decisions affect public safety and thus the architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture
practical technical and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction though the formal study of architecture in academic institutions has played a pivotal role in the development of the profession
throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans such as stone masons and carpenters rising to the role of master builder
until modern times there was no clear distinction between architect and engineer
in europe the titles architect and engineer were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person often used interchangeably
architect derives from greek
in most developed countries only those qualified with an appropriate license certification or registration with a relevant body may legally practice architecture
such licensure usually required a university degree successful completion of exams as well as a training period
representation of oneself as an architect through the use of terms and titles was restricted to licensed individuals by law although in general derivatives such as architectural designer were not legally protected
to practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision
the term building design professional by contrast is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession such as engineering professionals or those who assist in the practice of architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect such as intern architects
in many places independent non licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions such as the design houses or other smaller structures
in the architectural profession technical and environmental knowledge design and construction management require an understanding of business as well as design
however design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond
an architect accepts a commission from a client
the commission might involve preparing feasibility reports building audits designing a building or several buildings structures and the spaces among them
the architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building
throughout the project the architect coordinates a design team
structural mechanical and electrical engineers are hired by the client or architect who must ensure that the work is coordinated to construct the design
the architect once hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use
the architect must meet with and put questions to the client in order to ascertain all the requirements of the planned project
often the full brief is not clear in the beginning
it involves a degree of risk in the design undertaking
the architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief
the program is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner
this becomes a guide for the architect in creating the design concept
design proposal are generally expected to be both imaginative and pragmatic
much depends upon the time place finance culture and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place
the extent and nature of these expectations will vary
foresight is a prerequisite when designing buildings as it is a very complex and demanding undertaking
any design concept during the early stage of its generation must take into account a great number of issues and variables including qualities of space the end use and life cycle of these proposed spaces connections relations and aspects between spaces including how they are put together and the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality
selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks which could occur later in the project
the site and its surrounding environment as well as the culture and history of the place will also influence the design
the design must also balance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability
the architect may introduce aspects of mathematics and architecture new or current architectural theory or references to architectural history
a key part of the design is that the architect often must consult with engineers surveyors and other specialists throughout the design ensuring that aspects such as structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated
the control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations
coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication including advanced computer technology such as building information modeling computer aided design and cloud based technologies
finally at all times the architect must report back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations which might introduce further variables into the design
architects also deal with local and federal jurisdictions regarding regulations and building codes
the architect might need to comply with local planning and zoning laws such as required setbacks height limitations parking requirements transparency requirements and land use
some jurisdictions require adherence to design and historic preservation guidelines
health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design and in some jurisdictions design reports and records are required to include ongoing considerations of materials and contaminants waste management and recycling traffic control and fire safety
previously architects employed drawings to illustrate and generate design proposals
while conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects computer technology has now become the industry standard
furthermore design may include the use of photos collages prints linocuts d scanning technology and other media in design production
increasingly computer software is shaping how architects work
bim technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life cycle of the buildings design construction and maintenance
virtual reality presentations are becoming more common for visualizing structural designs and interior spaces from the point of view perspective
since modern buildings are known to place carbon into the atmosphere increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions increase energy efficiency and make use of renewable energy sources
renewable energy sources may be designed into the proposed building by local or national renewable energy providers
as a result the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations that are continually being updated
some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use or passive solar building design
however the architect is also increasingly being required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense
examples of this include making provisions for low energy transport natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting natural ventilation instead of air conditioning pollution and waste management use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled
as the design becomes more advanced and detailed specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building
techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances
depending on the clients needs and the jurisdictions requirements the spectrum of the architects services during each construction stage may be extensive or less involved
architects typically put projects to tender on behalf of their clients advise them on the award of the project to a general contractor facilitate and administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor
this contract is legally binding and covers a wide range of aspects including the insurance and commitments of all stakeholders the status of the design documents provisions for the architects access and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed
depending on the type of contract utilized provisions for further sub contract tenders may be required
the architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material product or work
in most jurisdictions prior notification to the relevant authority must be given before commencement of the project giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections
the architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority
the architect will typically review contractor shop drawings and other submittals prepare and issue site instructions and provide certificates for payment to the contractor which is based on the work done as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired in the future
in the united kingdom and other countries a quantity surveyor is often part of the team to provide cost consulting
with large complex projects an independent construction manager is sometimes hired to assist in the design and management of the construction
in many jurisdictions mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required
this demand for certification entails a high degree of risk therefore regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that the design is in compliance itself as well as following all relevant statutes and permissions
recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession
many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types technological expertise or project delivery methods
some architects specialize in building code building envelope sustainable design technical writing historic preservation or conservation and accessibility
many architects elect to move into real estate development corporate facilities planning project management construction management chief sustainability officers interior design city planning user experience design and design research
professional requirements although there are variations in each location most of the worlds architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction
architects are typically required to meet three common requirements education experience and examination
basic educational requirement generally consist of a university degree in architecture
the experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship
finally a registration examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure
professionals who engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting
instead they often trained under established architects
prior to modern times there was no distinction between architects and engineers and the title used varied depending on geographical location
they often carried the title of master builder or surveyor after serving a number of years as an apprentice
the formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory
the use of architect or abbreviations such as ar
as a title attached to a persons name was regulated by law in some countries
architects fee structure was typically based on a percentage of construction value as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee
combination of these structures was also common
fixed fees were usually based on a projects allocated construction cost and could range between and of new construction cost for commercial and institutional projects depending on a projects size and complexity
residential projects ranged from to
renovation projects typically commanded higher percentages such as
overall billings for architectural firms range widely depending on their location and economic climate
billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but with rapid globalization this is becoming less of a factor for large international firms
salaries could also vary depending on experience position within the firm and the size and location of the firm
a number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture
a wide variety of prizes is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies recognizing accomplished architects their buildings structures and professional careers
the most lucrative award an architect can receive is the pritzker prize sometimes termed the nobel prize for architecture
the inaugural pritzker prize winner was philip johnson who was cited for years of imagination and vitality embodied in a myriad of museums theatres libraries houses gardens and corporate structure
the pritzker prize has been awarded for forty two straight editions without interruption and there are now countries with at least one winning architect
other prestigious architectural awards are the royal gold medal the aia gold medal aia gold medal and the praemium imperiale
architects in the uk who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession might until be elected fellows of the royal institute of british architects and can write friba after their name if they feel so inclined
those elected to chartered membership of the riba after may use the initials riba but cannot use the old ariba and friba
an honorary fellow may use the initials hon
and an international fellow may use the initials int
architects in the us who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education or have in some other way advanced the profession are elected fellows of the american institute of architects and can write faia after their name
architects in canada who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research scholarship public service or professional standing to the good of architecture in canada or elsewhere may be recognized as a fellow of the royal architectural institute of canada and can write fraic after their name
in hong kong those elected to chartered membership may use the initial hkia and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by the hong kong institute of architects may be elected as fellow members of hkia and may use fhkia after their name
architects in the philippines and filipino communities overseas especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time are addressed and introduced as architect rather than sir madam in speech or mr mrs ms before surnames
that word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname
an abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase by any method
it may consist of a group of letters or words taken from the full version of the word or phrase for example the word abbreviation can itself be represented by the abbreviation abbr
or abbrev
npo for nil per os is an abbreviated medical instruction
it may also consist of initials only a mixture of initials and words or words or letters representing words in another language
some types of abbreviations are acronyms or grammatical contractions or crasis
an abbreviation is a shortening by any of these or other methods
acronyms initialisms contractions and crasis share some semantic and phonetic functions and all four are connected by the term abbreviation in loose parlance
an initialism is an abbreviation pronounced by spelling out each letter ie fbi usa ibm bbc a contraction is a reduction in the length of a word or phrase made by omitting certain of its letters or syllables
consequently contractions are a subset of abbreviations
often but not always the contraction includes the first and last letters or elements
examples of contractions are lil im and hedve
abbreviations have a long history
they were created to avoid spelling out whole words
this might be done to save time and space and also to provide secrecy
in both greece and rome the reduction of words to single letters was common
in roman inscriptions words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation
however some could have more than one meaning depending on their context
many frequent abbreviations consisted of more than one letter for example cos for consul and coss for its nominative etc
plural consules
abbreviations were frequently used in english from its earliest days
manuscripts of copies of the old english poem beowulf used many abbreviations for example the tironian et or for and and for since so that not much space is wasted
the standardisation of english in the th through th centuries included a growth in the use of such abbreviations
at first abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs not only periods
for example sequences like er were replaced with as in mast for master and exacbate for exacerbate
while this may seem trivial it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time
in the early modern english period between the th and th centuries the thorn was used for th as in
in modern times was often used for promotional reasons as in
during the growth of philological linguistic theory in academic britain abbreviating became very fashionable
likewise a century earlier in boston a fad of abbreviation started that swept the united states with the globally popular term ok generally credited as a remnant of its influence
over the years however the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not
this question is considered below
widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the internet during the s led to a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation
this was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant and text messaging
the original sms supported message lengths of characters at most for instance
this brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called textese with which or more of the words in a typical sms message are abbreviated
more recently twitter a popular social networking service began driving abbreviation use with character message limits
in html abbreviations can be annotated using abbreviation to reveal its meaning by hovering the cursor
in modern english there are several conventions for abbreviations and the choice may be confusing
the only rule universally accepted is that one should be consistent and to make this easier publishers express their preferences in a style guide
some questions which arise are shown below
if the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital for example lev
for leviticus
when a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization
however when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken then all letters should be capitalized as in ytd for year to date pcb for printed circuit board and fyi for for your information
however see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary these are no longer written with capital letters
a period is often used to signify an abbreviation but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen
according to harts rules the traditional rule is that abbreviations terminate with a full stop whereas contractions do not but there are exceptions
fowlers modern english usage says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions but recommends against this practice advising them only for abbreviations and lower case initialisms and not for upper case initialisms and contractions
some british style guides such as those for the guardian and the economist require that full stops be entirely omitted from all abbreviations
in american english the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction eg dr or mrs
in some cases periods are optional as in either us or us for united states eu or eu for european union and un or un for united nations
there are some house styles however american ones included that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations
for example acronyms that were originally capitalized but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods
examples are sonar radar lidar laser snafu and scuba
today spaces are generally not used between single letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase so one almost never encounters u
when an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence only one period is used the capital of the united states is washington dc
there is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations particularly acronyms
some writers tend to pluralize abbreviations by adding as in two pcs have broken screens although this notation typically indicates possessive case
however this style is not preferred by many style guides
for instance kate turabian writing about style in academic writings allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters
turabian would therefore prefer dvds and urls and phds while the modern language association explicitly says do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation
also the american psychological association specifically says without an apostrophe
however the style guide for the new york times states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations preferring pcs tvs and vcrs
following those who would generally omit the apostrophe to form the plural of run batted in simply add an s to the end of rbi
to form the plural of an abbreviation a number or a capital letter used as a noun simply add a lowercase s to the end
apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common
to indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure the same form is used as in the singular
when an abbreviation contains more than one full point harts rules recommends putting the s after the final one
according to harts rules an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects
in latin and continuing to the derivative forms in european languages as well as english single letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note taking
most of these deal with writing and publishing
a few longer abbreviations use this as well
publications based in the us tend to follow the style guides of the chicago manual of style and the associated press
the us government follows a style guide published by the us government printing office
the national institute of standards and technology sets the style for abbreviations of units
writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure
such shorthand can be an abbreviation such as in for inch or can be a symbol such as km for kilometre
in the international system of units manual the word symbol is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various si units of measure
the manual also defines the way in which units should be written the principal rules being a syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words such as interpol international police
it is a variant of the acronym
syllabic abbreviations are usually written using lower case sometimes starting with a capital letter and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter
syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from portmanteaus which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each
in albanian syllabic acronyms are sometimes used for composing a persons name such as migjeni an abbreviation from his original name a famous albanian poet and writer or asdreni another famous albanian poet
other such names which are used commonly in recent decades are getoar composed from gegeria tosks and arbanon which is an alternative way used to describe all albanian lands
syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in english
some uk government agencies such as ofcom and the former oftel use this style
new york city has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation such as tribeca and soho
this usage has spread into other american cities giving soma san francisco and lodo denver amongst others
chicago based electric service provider comed is a syllabic abbreviation of commonwealth and edison
sections of california are also often colloquially syllabically abbreviated as in norcal cencal and socal
additionally in the context of los angeles the syllabic abbreviation soho refers to the southern portion of the hollywood neighborhood
partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the us navy as they increase readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms
hence desron is used to mean destroyer squadron while comnavairlant would be commander naval air force atlantic
syllabic abbreviations are a prominent feature of newspeak the fictional language of george orwells dystopian novel nineteen eighty four
the political contractions of newspeak ingsoc minitrue miniplenty are described by orwell as similar to real examples of german and russian contractions in the th century
like nazi and gestapo politburo comintern kolkhoz and komsomol the contractions in newspeak are supposed to have a political function by virtue of their abbreviated structure itself nice sounding and easily pronounceable their purpose is to mask all ideological content from the speaker
a more recent syllabic abbreviation has emerged with the disease covid caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
syllabic abbreviations were and are common in german much like acronyms in english they have a distinctly modern connotation although contrary to popular belief many date back to before if not the end of the great war
kriminalpolizei literally criminal police but idiomatically the criminal investigation department of any german police force begat kripo and likewise schutzpolizei begat schupo
along the same lines the swiss federal railways transit police the transportpolizei are abbreviated as the trapo
with the national socialist german workers party gaining power came a frenzy of government reorganisation and with it a series of entirely new syllabic abbreviations
the single national police force amalgamated from the schutzpolizeien of the various states became the orpo the state kripos together formed the sipo and there was also the gestapo
the new order of the german democratic republic in the east brought about a conscious denazification but also a repudiation of earlier turns of phrase in favour of neologisms such as stasi for staatssicherheit and vopo for volkspolizei
the phrase politisches bro which may be rendered literally as office of politics or idiomatically as political party steering committee became politbro
syllabic abbreviations are not only used in politics however
many business names trademarks and service marks from across germany are created on the same pattern for a few examples there is aldi from theo albrecht the name of its founder followed by discount haribo from hans riegel the name of its founder followed by bonn the town of its head office and adidas from adolf adi dassler the nickname of its founder followed by his surname
syllabic abbreviations are very common in russian belarusian and ukrainian languages
they are often used as names of organizations
historically popularization of abbreviations was a way to simplify mass education in s
leninist organisations such as the comintern and komsomol used russian language syllabic abbreviations
in the modern russian language words like rosselkhozbank and minobrnauki are still commonly used
in nearby belarus there are beltelecom and belsat
syllabic abbreviations are common in spanish examples abound in organization names such as pemex for petrleos mexicanos or fonafifo for fondo nacional de financimiento forestal
in southeast asian languages especially in malay languages syllabic abbreviations are also common examples include petronas its indonesian equivalent pertamina and kemenhub east asian languages whose writing systems use chinese characters form abbreviations similarly by using key chinese characters from a term or phrase
for example in japanese the term for the united nations kokusai reng is often abbreviated to kokuren
in japanese see also japanese abbreviated and contracted words
the syllabic abbreviation of kanji words is frequently used for universities for instance tdai for tky daigaku and is used similarly in chinese bid for bijng dxu
the english phrase gung ho originated as a chinese abbreviation
aphrodite is an ancient greek goddess associated with love lust beauty pleasure passion procreation and as her syncretized roman goddess counterpart desire sex fertility prosperity and victory
aphrodites major symbols include seashells myrtles roses doves sparrows and swans
the cult of aphrodite was largely derived from that of the phoenician goddess astarte a cognate of the east semitic goddess ishtar whose cult was based on the sumerian cult of inanna
aphrodites main cult centers were cythera cyprus corinth and athens
her main festival was the aphrodisia which was celebrated annually in midsummer
in laconia aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess
she was also the patron goddess of prostitutes an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of sacred prostitution in greco roman culture an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous
in hesiods theogony aphrodite is born off the coast of cythera from the foam produced by uranuss genitals which his son cronus had severed and thrown into the sea
in homers iliad however she is the daughter of zeus and dione
plato in his symposium asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities aphrodite ourania and aphrodite pandemos
aphrodite had many other epithets each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess or used by a different local cult
thus she was also known as cytherea and cypris because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth
in greek mythology aphrodite was married to hephaestus the god of fire blacksmiths and metalworking
aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers in the odyssey she is caught in the act of adultery with ares the god of war
in the first homeric hymn to aphrodite she seduces the mortal shepherd anchises
aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd adonis who was killed by a wild boar
along with athena and hera aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the trojan war and she plays a major role throughout the iliad
aphrodite has been featured in western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of western literature
she is a major deity in modern neopagan religions including the church of aphrodite wicca and hellenismos
hesiod derives aphrodite from sea foam interpreting the name as risen from the foam but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious folk etymology
early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that aphrodites name was of greek or indo european origin but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned
aphrodites name is generally accepted to be of non greek probably semitic origin but its exact derivation cannot be determined
scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries accepting hesiods foam etymology as genuine analyzed the second part of aphrodites name as odt wanderer or dt bright
more recently michael janda also accepting hesiods etymology has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an indo european mytheme
similarly krzysztof tomasz witczak proposes an indo european compound very and to shine also referring to eos and daniel klligan has interpreted her name as shining up from the mist foam
other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since aphrodites attributes are entirely different from those of both eos and the vedic deity ushas
a number of improbable non greek etymologies have also been suggested
one semitic etymology compares aphrodite to the assyrian barrtu the name of a female demon that appears in middle babylonian and late babylonian texts
hammarstrm looks to etruscan comparing prni lord an etruscan honorific loaned into greek as
this would make the theonym in origin an honorific the lady
most scholars reject this etymology as implausible especially since aphrodite actually appears in etruscan in the borrowed form apru
the medieval etymologicum magnum offers a highly contrived etymology deriving aphrodite from the compound habrodaitos she who lives delicately from habrs and daita
the alteration from b to ph is explained as a familiar characteristic of greek obvious from the macedonians
in the cypriot syllabary a syllabic script used on the island of cyprus from the eleventh until the fourth century bc her name is attested in the forms and finally
the cult of aphrodite in greece was imported from or at least influenced by the cult of astarte in phoenicia which in turn was influenced by the cult of the mesopotamian goddess known as ishtar to the east semitic peoples and as inanna to the sumerians
pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of aphrodite were the assyrians followed by the paphians of cyprus and then the phoenicians at ascalon
the phoenicians in turn taught her worship to the people of cythera
aphrodite took on inanna ishtars associations with sexuality and procreation
furthermore she was known as ourania which means heavenly a title corresponding to inannas role as the queen of heaven
early artistic and literary portrayals of aphrodite are extremely similar on inanna ishtar
like inanna ishtar aphrodite was also a warrior goddess the second century ad greek geographer pausanias records that in sparta aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia which means warlike
he also mentions that aphrodites most ancient cult statues in sparta and on cythera showed her bearing arms
modern scholars note that aphrodites warrior goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her near eastern origins
nineteenth century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the near east but even friedrich gottlieb welcker who argued that near eastern influence on greek culture was largely confined to material culture admitted that aphrodite was clearly of phoenician origin
the significant influence of near eastern culture on early greek religion in general and on the cult of aphrodite in particular is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century bc when archaic greece was on the fringes of the neo assyrian empire
some early comparative mythologists opposed to the idea of a near eastern origin argued that aphrodite originated as an aspect of the greek dawn goddess eos and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the proto indo european dawn goddess hauss
most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely indo european aphrodite but it is possible that aphrodite originally a semitic deity may have been influenced by the indo european dawn goddess
both aphrodite and eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality and both had relationships with mortal lovers
both goddesses were associated with the colors red white and gold
michael janda etymologizes aphrodites name as an epithet of eos meaning she who rises from the foam the ocean and points to hesiods theogony account of aphrodites birth as an archaic reflex of indo european myth
aphrodite rising out of the waters after cronus defeats uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the rigvedic myth of indra defeating vrtra liberating ushas
another key similarity between aphrodite and the indo european dawn goddess is her close kinship to the greek sky deity since both of the main claimants to her paternity are sky deities
aphrodites most common cultic epithet was ourania meaning heavenly but this epithet almost never occurs in literary texts indicating a purely cultic significance
another common name for aphrodite was pandemos
in her role as aphrodite pandemos aphrodite was associated with peith meaning persuasion and could be prayed to for aid in seduction
the character of pausanias in platos symposium takes differing cult practices associated with different epithets of the goddess to claim that ourania and pandemos are in fact separate goddesses
he asserts that aphrodite ourania is the celestial aphrodite born from the sea foam after cronus castrated uranus and the older of the two goddesses
according to the symposium aphrodite ourania is the inspiration of male homosexual desire specifically the ephebic eros and pederasty
aphrodite pandemos by contrast is the younger of the two goddesses the common aphrodite born from the union of zeus and dione and the inspiration of heterosexual desire and sexual promiscuity the lesser of the two loves
paphian was one of her epithets after the paphos in cyprus where she had emerged from the sea at her birth
among the neoplatonists and later their christian interpreters ourania is associated with spiritual love and pandemos with physical love
a representation of ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love it was the subject of a chryselephantine sculpture by phidias for elis known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer pausanias
one of aphrodites most common literary epithets is philommeids which means smile loving but is sometimes mistranslated as laughter loving
this epithet occurs throughout both of the homeric epics and the first homeric hymn to aphrodite
hesiod references it once in his theogony in the context of aphrodites birth but interprets it as genital loving rather than smile loving
monica cyrino notes that the epithet may relate to the fact that in many artistic depictions of aphrodite she is shown smiling
other common literary epithets are cypris and cythereia which derive from her associations with the islands of cyprus and cythera respectively
on cyprus aphrodite was sometimes called eleemon
in athens she was known as aphrodite en kopois
at cape colias a town along the attic coast she was venerated as genetyllis mother
the spartans worshipped her as potnia mistress enoplios armed morpho shapely ambologera she who postpones old age
across the greek world she was known under epithets such as melainis black one skotia dark one androphonos killer of men anosia unholy and tymborychos gravedigger all of which indicate her darker more violent nature
she had the epithet automata because according to servius she was the source of spontaneous love
a male version of aphrodite known as aphroditus was worshipped in the city of amathus on cyprus
aphroditus was depicted with the figure and dress of a woman but had a beard and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect phallus
this gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer
eventually the popularity of aphroditus waned as the mainstream fully feminine version of aphrodite became more popular but traces of his cult are preserved in the later legends of hermaphroditus
aphrodites main festival the aphrodisia was celebrated across greece but particularly in athens and corinth
in athens the aphrodisia was celebrated on the fourth day of the month of hekatombaion in honor of aphrodites role in the unification of attica
during this festival the priests of aphrodite would purify the temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwestern slope of the acropolis with the blood of a sacrificed dove
next the altars would be anointed and the cult statues of aphrodite pandemos and peitho would be escorted in a majestic procession to a place where they would be ritually bathed
aphrodite was also honored in athens as part of the arrhephoria festival
the fourth day of every month was sacred to aphrodite
pausanias records that in sparta aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia which means warlike
this epithet stresses aphrodites connections to ares with whom she had extramarital relations
pausanias also records that in sparta and on cythera a number of extremely ancient cult statues of aphrodite portrayed her bearing arms
other cult statues showed her bound in chains
aphrodite was the patron goddess of prostitutes of all varieties ranging from pornai to hetairai
the city of corinth was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many hetairai who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled but also the most expensive prostitutes in the greek world
corinth also had a major temple to aphrodite located on the acrocorinth and was one of the main centers of her cult
records of numerous dedications to aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions
references to aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in corinth as well as on the islands of cyprus cythera and sicily
aphrodites mesopotamian precursor inanna ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution
scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries believed that the cult of aphrodite may have involved ritual prostitution an assumption based on ambiguous passages in certain ancient texts particularly a fragment of a skolion by the boeotian poet pindar which mentions prostitutes in corinth in association with aphrodite
modern scholars now dismiss the notion of ritual prostitution in greece as a historiographic myth with no factual basis
during the hellenistic period the greeks identified aphrodite with the ancient egyptian goddesses hathor and isis
aphrodite was the patron goddess of the lagid queens and queen arsinoe ii was identified as her mortal incarnation
aphrodite was worshipped in alexandria and had numerous temples in and around the city
arsinoe ii introduced the cult of adonis to alexandria and many of the women there partook in it
the tessarakonteres a gigantic catamaran galley designed by archimedes for ptolemy iv philopator had a circular temple to aphrodite on it with a marble statue of the goddess herself
in the second century bc ptolemy viii physcon and his wives cleopatra ii and cleopatra iii dedicated a temple to aphrodite hathor at philae
statuettes of aphrodite for personal devotion became common in egypt starting in the early ptolemaic times and extending until long after egypt became a roman province
the ancient romans identified aphrodite with their goddess venus who was originally a goddess of agricultural fertility vegetation and springtime
according to the roman historian livy aphrodite and venus were officially identified in the third century bc when the cult of venus erycina was introduced to rome from the greek sanctuary of aphrodite on mount eryx in sicily
after this point romans adopted aphrodites iconography and myths and applied them to venus
because aphrodite was the mother of the trojan hero aeneas in greek mythology and roman tradition claimed aeneas as the founder of rome venus became venerated as venus genetrix the mother of the entire roman nation
julius caesar claimed to be directly descended from aeneass son iulus and became a strong proponent of the cult of venus
this precedent was later followed by his nephew augustus and the later emperors claiming succession from him
this syncretism greatly impacted greek worship of aphrodite
during the roman era the cults of aphrodite in many greek cities began to emphasize her relationship with troy and aeneas
they also began to adopt distinctively roman elements portraying aphrodite as more maternal more militaristic and more concerned with administrative bureaucracy
she was claimed as a divine guardian by many political magistrates
appearances of aphrodite in greek literature also vastly proliferated usually showing aphrodite in a characteristically roman manner
aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship paphos on the island of cyprus which is why she is sometimes called cyprian especially in the poetic works of sappho
the sanctuary of aphrodite paphia marking her birthplace was a place of pilgrimage in the ancient world for centuries
other versions of her myth have her born near the island of cythera hence another of her names cytherea
cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between crete and the peloponesus so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of aphrodites cult from the middle east to mainland greece
according to the version of her birth recounted by hesiod in his theogony cronus severed uranus genitals and threw them behind him into the sea
the foam from his genitals gave rise to aphrodite while the giants the erinyes and the meliae emerged from the drops of his blood
hesiod states that the genitals were carried over the sea a long time and white foam arose from the immortal flesh with it a girl grew
after aphrodite was born from the sea foam she washed up to shore in the presence of the other gods
hesiods account of aphrodites birth following uranuss castration is probably derived from the song of kumarbi an ancient hittite epic poem in which the god kumarbi overthrows his father anu the god of the sky and bites off his genitals causing him to become pregnant and give birth to anus children which include ishtar and her brother teshub the hittite storm god
in the iliad aphrodite is described as the daughter of zeus and dione
diones name appears to be a feminine cognate to dios and dion which are oblique forms of the name zeus
zeus and dione shared a cult at dodona in northwestern greece
in theogony hesiod describes dione as an oceanid but apollodorus makes her the thirteenth titan child of gaia and uranus
aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile infinitely desirable adult having had no childhood
she is often depicted nude
in the iliad aphrodite is the apparently unmarried consort of ares the god of war and the wife of hephaestus is a different goddess named charis
likewise in hesiods theogony aphrodite is unmarried and the wife of hephaestus is aglaea the youngest of the three charites
in book eight of the odyssey however the blind singer demodocus describes aphrodite as the wife of hephaestus and tells how she committed adultery with ares during the trojan war
the sun god helios saw aphrodite and ares having sex in hephaestuss bed and warned hephaestus who fashioned a net of gold
the next time ares and aphrodite had sex together the net trapped them both
hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers but apollo hermes and poseidon had sympathy for ares and poseidon agreed to pay hephaestus for aress release
humiliated aphrodite returned to cyprus where she was attended by the charites
this narrative probably originated as a greek folk tale originally independent of the odyssey
in a much later interpolated detail ares put the young soldier alectryon by their door to warn them of helioss arrival as helios would tell hephaestus of aphrodites infidelity if the two were discovered but alectryon fell asleep on guard duty
helios discovered the two and alerted hephaestus as ares in rage turned alectryon into a rooster which always crows at dawn when the sun is about to rise announcing its arrival
after exposing them hephaestus asks zeus for his wedding gifts and dowry to be returned to him by the time of the trojan war he is married to charis aglaea one of the graces apparently divorced from aphrodite
afterwards it was generally ares who was regarded as the husband or official consort of the goddess on the franois vase the two arrive at the wedding of peleus and thetis on the same chariot as do zeus with hera and poseidon with amphitrite moreover poets such as pindar and aeschylus explicitly refer to ares as aphrodites husband
later stories were invented to explain aphrodites marriage to hephaestus
in the most famous story zeus hastily married aphrodite to hephaestus in order to prevent the other gods from fighting over her
in another version of the myth hephaestus gave his mother hera a golden throne but when she sat on it she became trapped and he refused to let her go until she agreed to give him aphrodites hand in marriage
hephaestus was overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty and forged her beautiful jewelry including a strophion known as the a saltire shaped undergarment which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men
such strophia were commonly used in depictions of the near eastern goddesses ishtar and atargatis
aphrodite is almost always accompanied by eros the god of lust and sexual desire
in his theogony hesiod describes eros as one of the four original primeval forces born at the beginning of time but after the birth of aphrodite from the sea foam he is joined by himeros and together they become aphrodites constant companions
in early greek art eros and himeros are both shown as idealized handsome youths with wings
the greek lyric poets regarded the power of eros and himeros as dangerous compulsive and impossible for anyone to resist
in modern times eros is often seen as aphrodites son but this is actually a comparatively late innovation
a scholion on theocrituss idylls remarks that the sixth century bc poet sappho had described eros as the son of aphrodite and uranus but the first surviving reference to eros as aphrodites son comes from apollonius of rhodess argonautica written in the third century bc which makes him the son of aphrodite and ares
later the romans who saw venus as a mother goddess seized on this idea of eros as aphrodites son and popularized it making it the predominant portrayal in works on mythology until the present day
aphrodites main attendants were the three charites whom hesiod identifies as the daughters of zeus and eurynome and names as aglaea euphrosyne and thalia
the charites had been worshipped as goddesses in greece since the beginning of greek history long before aphrodite was introduced to the pantheon
aphrodites other set of attendants was the three horae whom hesiod identifies as the daughters of zeus and themis and names as eunomia dike and eirene
aphrodite was also sometimes accompanied by harmonia her daughter by ares and hebe the daughter of zeus and hera
the fertility god priapus was usually considered to be aphrodites son by dionysus but he was sometimes also described as her son by hermes adonis or even zeus
a scholion on apollonius of rhodess argonautica states that while aphrodite was pregnant with priapus hera envied her and applied an evil potion to her belly while she was sleeping to ensure that the child would be hideous
in another version hera cursed aphrodites unborn son because he had been fathered by zeus
when aphrodite gave birth she was horrified to see that the child had a massive permanently erect penis a potbelly and a huge tongue
aphrodite abandoned the infant to die in the wilderness but a herdsman found him and raised him later discovering that priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants
the first homeric hymn to aphrodite which was probably composed sometime in the mid seventh century bc describes how zeus once became annoyed with aphrodite for causing deities to fall in love with mortals so he caused her to fall in love with anchises a handsome mortal shepherd who lived in the foothills beneath mount ida near the city of troy
aphrodite appears to anchises in the form of a tall beautiful mortal virgin while he is alone in his home
anchises sees her dressed in bright clothing and gleaming jewelry with her breasts shining with divine radiance
he asks her if she is aphrodite and promises to build her an altar on top of the mountain if she will bless him and his family
aphrodite lies and tells him that she is not a goddess but the daughter of one of the noble families of phrygia
she claims to be able to understand the trojan language because she had a trojan nurse as a child and says that she found herself on the mountainside after she was snatched up by hermes while dancing in a celebration in honor of artemis the goddess of virginity
aphrodite tells anchises that she is still a virgin and begs him to take her to his parents
anchises immediately becomes overcome with mad lust for aphrodite and swears that he will have sex with her
anchises takes aphrodite with her eyes cast downwards to his bed which is covered in the furs of lions and bears
he then strips her naked and makes love to her
after the lovemaking is complete aphrodite reveals her true divine form
anchises is terrified but aphrodite consoles him and promises that she will bear him a son
she prophesies that their son will be the demigod aeneas who will be raised by the nymphs of the wilderness for five years before going to troy to become a nobleman like his father
the story of aeneass conception is also mentioned in hesiods theogony and in book ii of homers iliad
the myth of aphrodite and adonis is probably derived from the ancient sumerian legend of inanna and dumuzid
the greek name is derived from the canaanite word adn meaning lord
the earliest known greek reference to adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the lesbian poet sappho in which a chorus of young girls asks aphrodite what they can do to mourn adoniss death
aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics
later references flesh out the story with more details
according to the retelling of the story found in the poem metamorphoses by the roman poet ovid adonis was the son of myrrha who was cursed by aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father king cinyras of cyprus after myrrhas mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess
driven out after becoming pregnant myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree but still gave birth to adonis
aphrodite found the baby and took him to the underworld to be fostered by persephone
she returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome
persephone wanted to keep adonis resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess adonis
zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that adonis would spend one third of the year with aphrodite one third with persephone and one third with whomever he chose
adonis chose to spend that time with aphrodite
then one day while adonis was hunting he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in aphrodites arms
in a semi mocking work the dialogues of the gods the satirical author lucian comedically relates how a frustrated aphrodite complains to the moon goddess selene about her son eros making persephone fall in love with adonis and now she has to share him with her
in different versions of the story the boar was either sent by ares who was jealous that aphrodite was spending so much time with adonis or by artemis who wanted revenge against aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower hippolytus
in another version apollo in fury changed himself into a boar and killed adonis because aphrodite had blinded his son erymanthus when he stumbled upon aphrodite naked as she was bathing after intercourse with adonis
the story also provides an etiology for aphrodites associations with certain flowers
reportedly as she mourned adoniss death she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death
in one version of the story aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose which had previously been white was stained red by her blood
according to lucians on the syrian goddess each year during the festival of adonis the adonis river in lebanon ran red with blood
the myth of adonis is associated with the festival of the adonia which was celebrated by greek women every year in midsummer
the festival which was evidently already celebrated in lesbos by sapphos time seems to have first become popular in athens in the mid fifth century bc
at the start of the festival the women would plant a garden of adonis a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick growing plants such as lettuce and fennel or even quick sprouting grains such as wheat and barley
the women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun
the plants would sprout in the sunlight but wither quickly in the heat
then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of adonis tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief
in hesiods works and days zeus orders aphrodite to make pandora the first woman physically beautiful and sexually attractive so that she may become an evil men will love to embrace
aphrodite spills grace over pandoras head and equips her with painful desire and knee weakening anguish thus making her the perfect vessel for evil to enter the world
aphrodites attendants peitho the charites and the horae adorn pandora with gold and jewelry
according to one myth aphrodite aided hippomenes a noble youth who wished to marry atalanta a maiden who was renowned throughout the land for her beauty but who refused to marry any man unless he could outrun her in a footrace
atalanta was an exceedingly swift runner and she beheaded all of the men who lost to her
aphrodite gave hippomenes three golden apples from the garden of the hesperides and instructed him to toss them in front of atalanta as he raced her
hippomenes obeyed aphrodites order and atalanta seeing the beautiful golden fruits bent down to pick up each one allowing hippomenes to outrun her
in the version of the story from ovids metamorphoses hippomenes forgets to repay aphrodite for her aid so she causes the couple to become inflamed with lust while they are staying at the temple of cybele
the couple desecrate the temple by having sex in it leading cybele to turn them into lions as punishment
the myth of pygmalion is first mentioned by the third century bc greek writer philostephanus of cyrene but is first recounted in detail in ovids metamorphoses
according to ovid pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of cyprus who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry
he fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of aphrodite and longed to marry it
because pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to aphrodite the goddess brought the statue to life
pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named paphos after whom the capital of cyprus received its name
pseudo apollodorus later mentions metharme daughter of pygmalion king of cyprus
aphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her but also punished those who disrespected her often quite brutally
a myth described in apollonius of rhodess argonautica and later summarized in the bibliotheca of pseudo apollodorus tells how when the women of the island of lemnos refused to sacrifice to aphrodite the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them
instead their husbands started having sex with their thracian slave girls
in anger the women of lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island as well as all the thracian slaves
when jason and his crew of argonauts arrived on lemnos they mated with the sex starved women under aphrodites approval and repopulated the island
from then on the women of lemnos never disrespected aphrodite again
in euripidess tragedy hippolytus which was first performed at the city dionysia in bc theseuss son hippolytus worships only artemis the goddess of virginity and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact
aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior and in the prologue to the play she declares that by honoring only artemis and refusing to venerate her hippolytus has directly challenged her authority
aphrodite therefore causes hippolytuss stepmother phaedra to fall in love with him knowing hippolytus will reject her
after being rejected phaedra commits suicide and leaves a suicide note to theseus telling him that she killed herself because hippolytus attempted to rape her
theseus prays to poseidon to kill hippolytus for his transgression
poseidon sends a wild bull to scare hippolytuss horses as he is riding by the sea in his chariot causing the horses to bolt and smash the chariot against the cliffs dragging hippolytus to a bloody death across the rocky shoreline
the play concludes with artemis vowing to kill aphrodites own mortal beloved in revenge
glaucus of corinth angered aphrodite by refusing to let his horses for chariot racing mate since doing so would hinder their speed
during the chariot race at the funeral games of king pelias aphrodite drove his horses mad and they tore him apart
polyphonte was a young woman who chose a virginal life with artemis instead of marriage and children as favoured by aphrodite
aphrodite cursed her causing her to have children by a bear
the resulting offspring agrius and oreius were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of zeus
ultimately he transformed all the members of the family into birds of ill omen
according to apollodorus a jealous aphrodite cursed eos the goddess of dawn to be perpetually in love and have insatiable sexual desire because eos once had lain with aphrodites sweetheart ares the god of war
according to ovid in his metamorphoses propoetides who are the daughters of propoetus from the city of amathus on the island of cyprus denied aphrodites divinity and failed to worship her properly
therefore aphrodite turned them into the worlds first prostitutes
according to diodorus siculus when the rhodian sea nymphe halias six sons by poseidon arrogantly refused to let aphrodite land upon their shore the goddess cursed them with insanity
in their madness they raped halia
as punishment poseidon buried them in the islands sea caverns
xanthius a descendent of bellerophon had two children leucippus and an unnamed daughter
through the wrath of aphrodite leucippus fell in love with his own sister
they started a secret relationship but the girl was already betrothed to another man and he went on to inform her father xanthius without telling him the name of the seducer
xanthius went straight to his daughters chamber where she was together with leucippus right at the moment
on hearing him enter she tried to escape but xanthius hit her with a dagger thinking that he was slaying the seducer and killed her
leucippus failing to recognize his father at first slew him
when the truth was revealed he had to leave the country and took part in colonization of crete and the lands in asia minor
queen cenchreis of cyprus wife of king cinyras bragged that her daughter myrrha was more beautiful than aphrodite
therefore myrrha was cursed by aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father king cinyras of cyprus and he slept with her unknowingly in the dark
she eventually transformed into the myrrh tree and gave birth to adonis in this form
cinyras also had three other daughters braesia laogora and orsedice
these girls by the wrath of aphrodite cohabited with foreigners and ended their life in egypt
the muse clio derided the goddess own love for adonis
therefore clio fell in love with pierus son of magnes and bore hyacinth
aegiale was a daughter of adrastus and amphithea and was married to diomedes
because of anger of aphrodite whom diomedes had wounded in the war against troy she had multiple lovers including a certain hippolytus
when aegiale went so far as to threaten his life he fled to italy
according to stesichorus and hesiod while tyndareus sacrificing to the gods he forgot aphrodite therefore goddess made his daughters twice and thrice wed and deserters of their husbands
timandra deserted echemus and went and came to phyleus and clytaemnestra deserted agamemnon and lay with aegisthus who was a worse mate for her and eventually killed her husband with her lover and finally helen of troy deserted menelaus under the influence of aphrodite for paris and her unfaitfulness eventually causes the war of troy
as a result of her actions aphrodite caused the war of troy in order to take priams kingdom and pass it down to her descendants
in one of the versions of the legend pasiphae did not make offerings to the goddess venus because of this venus personally i just cant get turned on by a system that expects me to either be content with a simple subtraction of numbers to find out who won or to describe an entire combat blow by blow just so that i can attempt some trick to win

athene or athena is the shrewd companion of heroes and the goddess of heroic endeavour in greek mythology
an alloy is a mixture of chemical elements of which at least one is a metal
unlike chemical compounds with metallic bases an alloy will retain all the properties of a metal in the resulting material such as electrical conductivity ductility opacity and luster but may have properties that differ from those of the pure metals such as increased strength or hardness
in some cases an alloy may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties
in other cases the mixture imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength
alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character
the alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications and in atomic fraction for basic science studies
alloys are usually classified as substitutional or interstitial alloys depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy
they can be further classified as homogeneous or heterogeneous or intermetallic
an alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements are of the same composition or a mixture of metallic phases
examples of alloys include red gold white gold sterling silver steel or silicon steel solder brass pewter duralumin bronze and amalgams
alloys are used in a wide variety of applications from the steel alloys used in everything from buildings to automobiles to surgical tools to exotic titanium alloys used in the aerospace industry to beryllium copper alloys for non sparking tools
an alloy is a mixture of chemical elements which forms an impure substance that retains the characteristics of a metal
an alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that with an alloy the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties while impure metals such as wrought iron are less controlled but are often considered useful
alloys are made by mixing two or more elements at least one of which is a metal
this is usually called the primary metal or the base metal and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy
the other constituents may or may not be metals but when mixed with the molten base they will be soluble and dissolve into the mixture
the mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents
a metal that is normally very soft such as aluminium can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal such as copper
although both metals are very soft and ductile the resulting aluminium alloy will have much greater strength
adding a small amount of non metallic carbon to iron trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called steel
due to its very high strength but still substantial toughness and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use
by adding chromium to steel its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced creating stainless steel while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics producing silicon steel
like oil and water a molten metal may not always mix with another element
for example pure iron is almost completely insoluble with copper
even when the constituents are soluble each will usually have a saturation point beyond which no more of the constituent can be added
iron for example can hold a maximum of carbon
although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the liquid state they may not always be soluble in the solid state
if the metals remain soluble when solid the alloy forms a solid solution becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals called a phase
if as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals creating a heterogeneous microstructure of different phases some with more of one constituent than the other
however in other alloys the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs
if cooled very quickly they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase but they are supersaturated with the secondary constituents
as time passes the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice becoming more stable and forming a second phase that serves to reinforce the crystals internally
some alloys such as electrum an alloy of silver and gold occur naturally
meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel but are not native to the earth
one of the first alloys made by humans was bronze which is a mixture of the metals tin and copper
bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components
steel was another common alloy
however in ancient times it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires during the manufacture of iron
other ancient alloys include pewter brass and pig iron
in the modern age steel can be created in many forms
carbon steel can be made by varying only the carbon content producing soft alloys like mild steel or hard alloys like spring steel
alloy steels can be made by adding other elements such as chromium molybdenum vanadium or nickel resulting in alloys such as high speed steel or tool steel
small amounts of manganese are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities like phosphorus sulfur and oxygen which can have detrimental effects on the alloy
however most alloys were not created until the s such as various aluminium titanium nickel and magnesium alloys
some modern superalloys such as incoloy inconel and hastelloy may consist of a multitude of different elements
an alloy is technically an impure metal but when referring to alloys the term impurities usually denotes undesirable elements
such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements but are removed during processing
for instance sulfur is a common impurity in steel
sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide which is very brittle creating weak spots in the steel
lithium sodium and calcium are common impurities in aluminium alloys which can have adverse effects on the structural integrity of castings
conversely otherwise pure metals that contain unwanted impurities are often called impure metals and are not usually referred to as alloys
oxygen present in the air readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying
great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities using fluxes chemical additives or other methods of extractive metallurgy
alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements
the most common and oldest alloying process is performed by heating the base metal beyond its melting point and then dissolving the solutes into the molten liquid which may be possible even if the melting point of the solute is far greater than that of the base
for example in its liquid state titanium is a very strong solvent capable of dissolving most metals and elements
in addition it readily absorbs gases like oxygen and burns in the presence of nitrogen
this increases the chance of contamination from any contacting surface and so must be melted in vacuum induction heating and special water cooled copper crucibles
however some metals and solutes such as iron and carbon have very high melting points and were impossible for ancient people to melt
thus alloying may also be performed with one or more constituents in a gaseous state such as found in a blast furnace to make pig iron nitriding carbonitriding or other forms of case hardening or the cementation process used to make blister steel
it may also be done with one more or all of the constituents in the solid state such as found in ancient methods of pattern welding shear steel or crucible steel production mixing the elements via solid state diffusion
by adding another element to a metal differences in the size of the atoms create internal stresses in the lattice of the metallic crystals stresses that often enhance its properties
for example the combination of carbon with iron produces steel which is stronger than iron its primary element
the electrical and thermal conductivity of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals
the physical properties such as density reactivity youngs modulus of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element but engineering properties such as tensile strength ductility and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials
this is sometimes a result of the sizes of the atoms in the alloy because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors helping the alloy resist deformation
sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present
for example impurities in semiconducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties as first predicted by white hogan suhl tian abrie and nakamura
unlike pure metals most alloys do not have a single melting point but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases
the temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the liquidus
for many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion called either a eutectic mixture or a peritectic composition which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point and no liquid solid slush transition
alloying elements are added to a base metal to induce hardness toughness ductility or other desired properties
most metals and alloys can be work hardened by creating defects in their crystal structure
these defects are created during plastic deformation by hammering bending extruding et cetera and are permanent unless the metal is recrystallized
otherwise some alloys can also have their properties altered by heat treatment
nearly all metals can be softened by annealing which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling
many alloys of aluminium copper magnesium titanium and nickel can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment but few respond to this to the same degree as does steel
the base metal iron of the iron carbon alloy known as steel undergoes a change in the arrangement of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature
this allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal
when this diffusion happens the carbon atoms are said to be in solution in the iron forming a particular single homogeneous crystalline phase called austenite
if the steel is cooled slowly the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope
during slow cooling the carbon atoms will no longer be as soluble with the iron and will be forced to precipitate out of solution nucleating into a more concentrated form of iron carbide in the spaces between the pure iron crystals
the steel then becomes heterogeneous as it is formed of two phases the iron carbon phase called cementite and pure iron ferrite
such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft
if the steel is cooled quickly however the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide but will be trapped within the iron crystals
when rapidly cooled a diffusionless transformation occurs in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution
this causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile
while the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented most heat treatable alloys are precipitation hardening alloys that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength
when heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly these alloys become much softer than normal during the diffusionless transformation but then harden as they age
the solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time forming intermetallic phases which are difficult to discern from the base metal
unlike steel in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal
these intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure but tend to behave heterogeneously becoming hard and somewhat brittle
in precipitation hardening alloys were discovered by alfred wilm
precipitation hardening alloys such as certain alloys of aluminium titanium and copper are heat treatable alloys that soften when quenched and then harden over time
wilm had been searching for a way to harden aluminium alloys for use in machine gun cartridge cases
knowing that aluminium copper alloys were heat treatable to some degree wilm tried quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium copper and the addition of magnesium but was initially disappointed with the results
however when wilm retested it the next day he discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature and far exceeded his expectations
although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until duralumin was one of the first age hardening alloys used becoming the primary building material for the first zeppelins and was soon followed by many others
because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry including the construction of modern aircraft
when a molten metal is mixed with another substance there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism
the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur
when the atoms are relatively similar in size the atom exchange method usually happens where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent
this is called a substitutional alloy
examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively
in the case of the interstitial mechanism one atom is usually much smaller than the other and can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal
instead the smaller atoms become trapped in the interstitial sites between the atoms of the crystal matrix
this is referred to as an interstitial alloy
steel is an example of an interstitial alloy because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix
stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms
the use of alloys by humans started with the use of meteoric iron a naturally occurring alloy of nickel and iron
it is the main constituent of iron meteorites
as no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel the alloy was used as it was
meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools weapons and nails
in many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads
they were often used as anvils
meteoric iron was very rare and valuable and difficult for ancient people to work
iron is usually found as iron ore on earth except for one deposit of native iron in greenland which was used by the inuit
native copper however was found worldwide along with silver gold and platinum which were also used to make tools jewelry and other objects since neolithic times
copper was the hardest of these metals and the most widely distributed
it became one of the most important metals to the ancients
around years ago in the highlands of anatolia humans learned to smelt metals such as copper and tin from ore
around bc people began alloying the two metals to form bronze which was much harder than its ingredients
tin was rare however being found mostly in great britain
in the middle east people began alloying copper with zinc to form brass
ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced such as hardness toughness and melting point under various conditions of temperature and work hardening developing much of the information contained in modern alloy phase diagrams
for example arrowheads from the chinese qin dynasty were often constructed with a hard bronze head but a softer bronze tang combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use
mercury has been smelted from cinnabar for thousands of years
mercury dissolves many metals such as gold silver and tin to form amalgams
amalgams have been used since bc in china for gilding objects such as armor and mirrors with precious metals
the ancient romans often used mercury tin amalgams for gilding their armor
the amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized leaving the gold silver or tin behind
mercury was often used in mining to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores
many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes
in ancient egypt and mycenae gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red gold or iron to produce a bright burgundy gold
gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of colored gold
these metals were also used to strengthen each other for more practical purposes
copper was often added to silver to make sterling silver increasing its strength for use in dishes silverware and other practical items
quite often precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers
around bc archimedes was commissioned by the king of syracuse to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown leading to the famous bath house shouting of eureka upon the discovery of archimedes principle
the term pewter covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin
as a pure metal tin is much too soft to use for most practical purposes
however during the bronze age tin was a rare metal in many parts of europe and the mediterranean so it was often valued higher than gold
to make jewellery cutlery or other objects from tin workers usually alloyed it with other metals to increase strength and hardness
these metals were typically lead antimony bismuth or copper
these solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts or added together making a wide variety of objects ranging from practical items such as dishes surgical tools candlesticks or funnels to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips
the earliest examples of pewter come from ancient egypt around bc
the use of pewter was widespread across europe from france to norway and britain to the near east
the alloy was also used in china and the far east arriving in japan around ad where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels tea canisters or chalices used in shinto shrines
the first known smelting of iron began in anatolia around bc
called the bloomery process it produced very soft but ductile wrought iron
by bc iron making technology had spread to europe arriving in japan around ad
pig iron a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and carbon was being produced in china as early as bc but did not arrive in europe until the middle ages
pig iron has a lower melting point than iron and was used for making cast iron
however these metals found little practical use until the introduction of crucible steel around bc
these steels were of poor quality and the introduction of pattern welding around the st century ad sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them to create a tougher metal
around ad the japanese began folding bloomery steel and cast iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords using clay fluxes to remove slag and impurities
this method of japanese swordsmithing produced one of the purest steel alloys of the ancient world
while the use of iron started to become more widespread around bc mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin the metal was much softer than bronze
however very small amounts of steel was always a byproduct of the bloomery process
the ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since bc and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons
because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the middle ages
this method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time but the absorption of carbon in this manner is extremely slow thus the penetration was not very deep so the alloy was not homogeneous
in benjamin huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel
huntsmans process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early s
the introduction of the blast furnace to europe in the middle ages meant that people could produce pig iron in much higher volumes than wrought iron
because pig iron could be melted people began to develop processes to reduce carbon in liquid pig iron to create steel
puddling had been used in china since the first century and was introduced in europe during the s where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air to remove the carbon by oxidation
in henry bessemer developed a process of steel making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content
the bessemer process led to the first large scale manufacture of steel
steel is an alloy of iron and carbon but the term alloy steel usually only refers to steels that contain other elements like vanadium molybdenum or cobalt in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel
since ancient times when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets
even long after the age of reason the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods
for example the people of sheffield a center of steel production in england were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter industrial espionage
thus almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until
because of this lack of understanding steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between and so alloy steel became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel alloys
after benjamin huntsman developed his crucible steel in he began experimenting with the addition of elements like manganese which helped remove impurities such as phosphorus and oxygen a process adopted by bessemer and still used in modern steels
afterward many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success
however in robert hadfield being a pioneer in steel metallurgy took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around manganese
called mangalloy it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness becoming the first commercially viable alloy steel
afterward he created silicon steel launching the search for other possible alloys of steel
robert forester mushet found that by adding tungsten to steel it could produce a very hard edge that would resist losing its hardness at high temperatures
mushets special steel became the first high speed steel
mushets steel was quickly replaced by tungsten carbide steel developed by taylor and white in in which they doubled the tungsten content and added small amounts of chromium and vanadium producing a superior steel for use in lathes and machining tools
in the wright brothers used a chromium nickel steel to make the crankshaft for their airplane engine while in henry ford began using vanadium steels for parts like crankshafts and valves in his model t ford due to their higher strength and resistance to high temperatures
in the krupp ironworks in germany developed a rust resistant steel by adding chromium and nickel producing the first stainless steel
due to their high reactivity most metals were not discovered until the th century
a method for extracting aluminium from bauxite was proposed by humphry davy in using an electric arc
although his attempts were unsuccessful by the first sales of pure aluminium reached the market
however as extractive metallurgy was still in its infancy most aluminium extraction processes produced unintended alloys contaminated with other elements found in the ore the most abundant of which was copper
these aluminium copper alloys preceded pure aluminium offering greater strength and hardness over the soft pure metal and to a slight degree were found to be heat treatable
however due to their softness and limited hardenability these alloys found little practical use and were more of a novelty until the wright brothers used an aluminium alloy to construct the first airplane engine in
during the time between and processes for extracting many other metals were discovered such as chromium vanadium tungsten iridium cobalt and molybdenum and various alloys were developed
prior to research mainly consisted of private individuals tinkering in their own laboratories
however as the aircraft and automotive industries began growing research into alloys became an industrial effort in the years following as new magnesium alloys were developed for pistons and wheels in cars and pot metal for levers and knobs and aluminium alloys developed for airframes and aircraft skins were put into use
throughout history forms of art have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions
movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways
not all artistic revolutions were political
sometimes science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists
the stylistic revolution known as impressionism by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid th century in which the style was born
michel eugne chevreul a french chemist hired as director of dyes at a french tapestry works began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics
chevreul realized it was the eye and not the dye that had the greatest influence on color and from this he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed each imposing its own complementary color on the other
the french painter eugne delacroix who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones embraced chevreuls book the law of contrast of color with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum
inspired by chevreuls treatise delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him
it was chevreul who led the impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewers eye to combine them optically
they were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself
since the renaissance painters had to grind pigment add oil and thus create their own paints these time consuming paints also quickly dried out making studio painting a necessity for large works and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out
in a little known american painter named john g
rand invented a simple improvement without which the impressionist movement could not have occurred the small flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored
oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist usable and portable
for the first time since the renaissance painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried
paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world to directly observe the play of color and natural light in shadow and movement to paint in the moment
selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments chrome yellow cadmium blue invented by th century industrial chemists
the tubes freed the impressionists to paint quickly and across an entire canvas rather than carefully delineated single color sections at a time in short to sketch directly in oil racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of impressionists since such speedy bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions not finished paintings which were to have no visible brush marks at all seamless under layers of varnish
pierre auguste renoir said without colors in tubes there would be no czanne no monet no pissarro and no impressionism
finally the careful hyper realistic techniques of french neo classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid s
it was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention particularly by the french inventor daguerre made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the paris diorama with large scale historical paintings
the neo classical subject matter limited by academic tradition to greek and roman legends historical battles and biblical stories seemed oppressively clichd and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera daily life candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things paris itself rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events
early photographs influenced impressionist style by its use of asymmetry cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography
edgar degas claude monet pierre auguste renoir in their framing use of color light and shadow subject matter put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning
their initial break with realism into an exploration of light color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the abstract expressionists who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war
at first thought of as primitive inept works as in my four year old could do that these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the s and s expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used or even understood
jackson pollock who pioneered splatter painting dispensing with a paint brush altogether soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in life magazine
in fact in a deliberate secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones abstract expressionists like pollock robert motherwell willem de kooning and mark rothko while seemingly difficult pathbreaking artists were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the central intelligence agency in a cold war policy begun in to prove that the united states could foster more artistic freedom than the soviet bloc
it was recognized that abstract expressionism was the kind of art that made socialist realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was said former cia case worker donald jameson who finally broke the silence on this program in
ironically the covert cia support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a european tour of these works during the truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative mccarthy era america with truman famously remarking if thats art im a hottentot
thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using cia funds not their own to sponsor traveling exhibitions of american abstract expressionists all over the world publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit abstract expressionist works in major american and british museums
thomas braden in charge of these cultural programs for the cia in the early years of the cold war had formerly been executive secretary of the museum of modern art americas leading institution for th century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out
agrarianism is a political and social philosophy that has promoted subsistence agriculture smallholdings and egalitarianism with agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights and sustainability of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society
in highly developed and industrial nations or regions it can denote use of financial and social incentives for self sustainability more community involvement in food production and smart growth that avoids urban sprawl and also what many of its advocates contend are risks of human overpopulation when overpopulation occurs the available resources become too limited for the entire population to survive comfortably or at all in the long term
some scholars suggest that agrarianism values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values
it stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life
for example m
thomas inge defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets the philosophical roots of agrarianism include european and chinese philosophers
the chinese school of agriculturalism was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism
in societies influenced by confucianism the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society but merchants who made money were looked down upon
that influenced european intellectuals like franois quesnay an avid confucianist and advocate of chinas agrarian policies in forming the french agrarian philosophy of physiocracy
the physiocrats along with the ideas of john locke and the romantic era formed the basis of modern european and american agrarianism
the united states president thomas jefferson was an agrarian who based his ideas about the budding american democracy around the notion that farmers are the most valuable citizens and the truest republicans
jefferson and his support base were committed to american republicanism which they saw as being in opposition to aristocracy and corruption and which prioritized virtue exemplified by the yeoman farmer planters and the plain folk
in praising the rural farmfolk the jeffersonians felt that financiers bankers and industrialists created cesspools of corruption in the cities and should thus be avoided
the jeffersonians sought to align the american economy more with agriculture than industry
part of their motive to do so was jeffersons fear that the over industrialization of america would create a class of wage slaves who relied on their employers for income and sustenance
in turn these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers
to counter this jefferson introduced as scholar clay jenkinson noted a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward and tariffs on imported articles which were mainly purchased by the wealthy
in jefferson writing to a friend explained these revenues will be levied entirely on the rich
the rich alone use imported articles and on these alone the whole taxes of the general government are levied
the poor man
pays not a farthing of tax to the general government but on his salt
there is general agreement that the substantial united states federal policy of offering land grants had a positive impact on economic development in the th century
agrarian socialism is a form of agrarianism that is anti capitalist in nature and seeks to introduce socialist economic systems in their stead
notable agrarian socialists include emiliano zapata who was a leading figure in the mexican revolution
as part of the liberation army of the south his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the mexican peasants whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes
zapata published plan of ayala which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in mexico as part of the revolution
zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the revolution but his political ideas lived on in the form of zapatismo
zapatismo would form the basis for neozapatismo the ideology of the zapatista army of national liberation
known as ejrcito zapatista de liberacin nacional or ezln in spanish ezln is a far left libertarian socialist political and militant group that emerged in the state of chiapas in southmost mexico in
ezln and neozapatismo as explicit in their name seek to revive the agrarian socialist movement of zapata but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community level decision making
when the land became property of the peasants
when the land passed into the hands of those who work it
was the starting point for advances in government health education housing nutrition womens participation trade culture communication and information
was recovering the means of production in this case the land animals and machines that were in the hands of large property owners
maoism the far left ideology of mao zedong and his followers places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals
in contrast to other marxist schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers maoism sees the peasantry as key
believing that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun maoism saw the chinese peasantry as the prime source for a marxist vanguard because it possessed two qualities they were poor and they were a political blank slate in maos words a clean sheet of paper has no blotches and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it
during the chinese civil war and the second sino japanese war mao and the chinese communist party made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics often eschewing the cities
following the eventual victory of the communist party in both wars the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for mao
in mao launched the great leap forward a social and economic campaign which amongst other things altered many aspects of rural chinese life
it introduced mandatory collective farming and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as peoples communes
these communes which consisted of people on average were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life
the communes were run as co operatives where wages and money were replaced by work points
peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as rightists and counter revolutionaries
leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible and those who attempted it were subjected to party orchestrated public struggle sessions which further jeopardized their survival
these public criticism sessions were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials and they often devolved into little more than public beatings
on the communes experiments were conducted in order to find new methods of planting crops efforts were made to construct new irrigation systems on a massive scale and the communes were all encouraged to produce steel backyard furnaces as part of an effort to increase steel production
however following the anti rightist campaign mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into china and thus engineers often were not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned
similarly the experimentation with the crops did not produce results
in addition to this the four pests campaign was launched in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds in order to protect fields
pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion
this campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population especially crop eating insects which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators
none of these new systems were working but local leaders did not dare to state this instead they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas
in many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas and in turn the chinese state developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the commune system
all of this culminated in the great chinese famine which began in lasted years and saw an estimated to million chinese people die
a combination of bad weather and the new failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food
by the great leap forward was declared to be at an end
in the late s and early s mao once again radically altered life in rural china with the launching of the down to the countryside movement
as a response to the great chinese famine the chinese president liu shaoqi began sending down urban youths to rural china in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities
however mao turned the practice into a political crusade declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants
in reality it was the communist partys attempt to reign in the red guards who had become uncontrollable during the course of the cultural revolution
of the urban population of china was sent out to remote rural villages often in inner mongolia
the villages which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the great chinese famine did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers
furthermore the so called sent down youth had no agricultural experience and as a result they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector
as a result many of the sent down youth died in the countryside
the relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent but by the end of the cultural revolution the communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so
in imitation of maos policies the khmer rouge of cambodia created their own version of the great leap forward which was known as maha lout ploh
with the great leap forward as its model it had similarly disastrous effects contributing to what is now known as the cambodian genocide
as a part of the maha lout ploh the khmer rouge sought to create an entirely agrarian socialist society by forcibly relocating people to move from cambodias cities into newly created communes
the khmer rouge leader pol pot sought to purify the country by setting it back to year zero freeing it from corrupting influences
besides trying to completely de urbanize cambodia ethnic minorities were slaughtered along with anyone else who was suspected of being a reactionary or a member of the bourgeoisie to the point that wearing glasses was seen as grounds for execution
the killings were only brought to an end when cambodia was invaded by the neighboring socialist nation of vietnam whose army toppled the khmer rouge
however with cambodias entire society and economy in disarray including its agricultural sector the country still plunged into renewed famine due to vast food shortages
however as international journalists began to report on the situation and send images of it out to the world a massive international response was provoked leading to one of the most concentrated relief efforts of its time
peasant parties first appeared across eastern europe between and when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers
agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it
they also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements
many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity
peasant parties rarely had any power before world war i but some became influential in the interwar era especially in bulgaria and czechoslovakia
for a while in the s and the s there was a green international based on the peasant parties in bulgaria czechoslovakia poland and serbia
it functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities
in bulgaria the bulgarian agrarian national union was organized in to resist taxes and build cooperatives
bzns came to power in and introduced many economic social and legal reforms
however conservative forces crushed bzns in a coup and assassinated its leader aleksandar stamboliyski
bzns was made into a communist puppet group until when it reorganized as a genuine party
in czechoslovakia the republican party of agricultural and smallholder people often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five party ptka coalition
the partys leader antonn vehla was prime minister several times
it was consistently the strongest party forming and dominating coalitions
it moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle class voters
the party was banned by the national front after the second world war
in france the hunting fishing nature tradition party is a moderate conservative agrarian party reaching a peak of in the french presidential election
it would later on become affiliated to frances main conservative party union for a popular movement
more recently the resistons movement of jean lassalle espoused agrarianism
in hungary the first major agrarian party the small holders party was founded in
the party became part of the government in the s but lost influence in the government
a new party the independent smallholders agrarian workers and civic party was established in with a more radical program representing larger scale land redistribution initiatives
they implemented this program together with the other coalition parties after wwii
however after the party was outlawed when a one party system was introduced
they became part of the government again and after which they lost political support
the ruling fidesz party has an agrarian faction and promotes agrarian interest since with the emphasis now placed on supporting larger family farms versus small holders
in the late th century the irish national land league aimed to abolish landlordism in ireland and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on
the land war of led to the irish land acts ending absentee landlords and ground rent and redistributing land among peasant farmers
post independence the farmers party operated in the irish free state from folding into the national centre party in
it was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of ireland
clann na talmhan was founded in
they focused more on the poor smallholders of the west supporting land reclamation afforestation social democracy and rates reform
they formed part of the governing coalition of the government of the th dil and government of the th dil
economic improvement in the s saw farmers vote for other parties and clann na talmhan disbanded in
in kazakhstan the peasants union originally a communist organization was formed as one of first agrarian parties in independent kazakhstan and would win four seats in the legislative election
the agrarian party of kazakhstan led by romin madinov was founded in which favored the privatization of agricultural land developments towards rural infrastructure as well as changes in the tax system in agrarian economy
the party would go on to win three mjilis seats in the legislative election and eventually unite with the civic party of kazakhstan to form the pro government agrarian industrial union of workers bloc that would be chaired by madinov for the legislative election with the aist bloc winning seats in the mjilis
from there the bloc remained short lived as it would merge with the ruling nur otan party in
several other parties in kazakhstan over the years have embraced agrarian policies in their programs in an effort to appeal towards a large rural kazakh demographic base which included amanat adal and respublica
since late s the auyl peoples democratic patriotic party remains the largest and most influential agrarian oriented party in kazakhstan as its presidential candidate jiguli dairabaev had become the second place frontrunner in the presidential election after sweeping of the vote
in the legislative election the auyl party for the first time was represented the parliament after winning nine seats in the lower chamber mjilis
the party raises rural issues in regard to decaying villages the agro industrial complex the issues of social security of the rural population and has consistently opposed the ongoing rural flight in kazakhstan
in latvia the union of greens and farmers is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large scale farming nature is threatened by development while small farms are threatened by large industrial scale farms
in lithuania as of the government is led by the lithuanian farmers and greens union under the leadership of industrial farmer ramnas karbauskis
in poland the polish peoples party traces its tradition to an agrarian party in austro hungarian controlled galician poland
after the fall of the communist regime ppps biggest success came in elections where it won out of parliamentary seats
since then ppps support has steadily declined until when they formed polish coalition with an anti establishment direct democracy kukiz party and managed to get of popular vote
moreover ppp tends to get much better results in local elections
in elections they have managed to get of votes
the right wing law and justice party has also become supportive of agrarian policies in recent years and polls show that most of their support comes from rural areas
agrounia resembles the features of agrarianism
in romania older party parties from transylvania moldavia and wallachia merged to become the national peasants party in
iuliu maniu was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from to and briefly in but the great depression made proposed reforms impossible
the forcefully introduced and illegal communist regime dissolved the party in but it reformed in after they fell from power
the reformed party which also incorporated elements of christian democracy in its ideology governed romania as part of the romanian democratic convention between and

the party also monopolized power in yugoslavia from to
during the dictatorship of the s the prime minister was from that party
in ukraine the radical party of oleh lyashko has promised to purify the country of oligarchs with a pitchfork
the party advocates a number of traditional left wing positions and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments
in land law the heyday of english irish agrarianism was to led by the tudor royal advisors who sought to maintain a broad pool of agricultural commoners from which to draw military men against the interests of larger landowners who sought enclosure
the heyday was eroded by hundreds of acts of parliament to expressly permit enclosure chiefly from to the s
politicians standing strongly as reactionaries to this included the levellers those anti industrialists going beyond opposing new weaving technology and later radicals such as william cobbett
a high level of net national or local self sufficiency has a strong base in campaigns and movements
in the th century such empowered advocates included peelites and most conservatives
the th century saw the growth or start of influential non governmental organisations such as the national farmers union of england and wales campaign for rural england friends of the earth and of the england wales scottish and northern irish political parties prefixed by and focussed on green politics
the st century has seen decarbonisation already in electricity markets
following protests and charitable lobbying local food has seen growing market share sometimes backed by wording in public policy papers and manifestos
the uk has many sustainability prioritising businesses green charity campaigns events and lobby groups ranging from espousing allotment gardens through to a clear policy of local food and or self sustainability models
historian fk crowley finds that the national party of australia from the s to the s promulgated its version of agrarianism which it called countrymindedness
the goal was to enhance the status of the graziers and small farmers and justified subsidies for them
the new zealand liberal party aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday
the landed gentry and aristocracy ruled britain at this time
new zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before
the liberal party set out to change that by a policy it called populism
richard seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as it is the rich and the poor it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes
that sir shows the real political position of new zealand
the liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported liberal ideals
the liberal government also established the basis of the later welfare state such as old age pensions and developed a system for settling industrial disputes which was accepted by both employers and trade unions
in it extended voting rights to women making new zealand the first country in the world to do so
to obtain land for farmers the liberal government from to purchased of maori land
the government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers
the advances to settlers act provided low interest mortgages and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods
the liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian anti monopoly land policy
the policy built up support for the liberal party in rural north island electorates
by the liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in parliament
the united states and canada both saw a rise of agrarian oriented parties in the early twentieth century as economic troubles motivated farming communities to become politically active
it has been proposed that different responses to agrarian protest largely determined the course of power generated by these newly energized rural factions
according to sociologist barry eidlinin the united states democrats adopted a co optive response to farmer and labor protest incorporating these constituencies into the new deal coalition
in canada both mainstream parties adopted a coercive response leaving these constituencies politically excluded and available for an independent left coalition
these reactions may have helped determine the outcome of agrarian power and political associations in the us and canada
economic desperation experienced by farmers across the state of kansas in the nineteenth century spurred the creation of the peoples party in and soon after would gain control of the governors office in
this party consisting of a mix of democrats socialists populists and fusionists would find itself buckling from internal conflict regarding the unlimited coinage of silver
the populists permanently lost power in
oklahoma farmers considered their political activity during the early twentieth century due to the outbreak of war depressed crop prices and an inhibited sense of progression towards owning their own farms
tenancy had been reportedly as high as in oklahoma by
these pressures saw agrarian counties in oklahoma supporting socialist policies and politics with the socialist platform proposing a deeply agrarian radical platform
the platform proposed a renters and farmers program which was strongly agrarian radical in its insistence upon various measures to put land into the hands of the actual tillers of the soil
although it did not propose to nationalize privately owned land it did offer numerous plans to enlarge the states public domain from which land would be rented at prevailing share rents to tenants until they had paid rent equal to the lands value
the tenant and his children would have the right of occupancy and use but the title would remind in the commonwealth an arrangement that might be aptly termed socialist fee simple
they proposed to exempt from taxation all farm dwellings animals and improvements up to the value of
the state board of agriculture would encourage co operative societies of farmers to make plans f or the purchase of land seed tools and for preparing and selling produce
in order to give farmers essential services at cost the socialists called for the creation of state banks and mortgage agencies crop insurance elevators and warehousesthis agrarian backed socialist party would win numerous offices causing a panic within the local democratic party
this agrarian socialist movement would be inhibited by voter suppression laws aimed at reducing the participation of voters of color as well as national wartime policies intended to disrupt political elements considered subversive
this party would peak in power in
agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the back to the land movement
agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society and on simple living even when the shift involves questioning the progressive character of some recent social and economic developments
thus agrarianism is not industrial farming with its specialization on products and industrial scale
in euclidean geometry an angle is the figure formed by two rays called the sides of the angle sharing a common endpoint called the vertex of the angle
angles formed by two rays are also known as plane angles as they lie in the plane that contains the rays
angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes these are called dihedral angles
two intersecting curves may also define an angle which is the angle of the rays lying tangent to the respective curves at their point of intersection
the magnitude of an angle is called an angular measure or simply angle
angle of rotation is a measure conventionally defined as the ratio of a circular arc length to its radius and may be a negative number
in the case of a geometric angle the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides
in the case of a rotation the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation
the word angle comes from the latin word meaning corner
cognate words include the greek meaning crooked curved and the english word ankle
both are connected with the proto indo european root ank meaning to bend or bow
euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other in a plane of two lines which meet each other and do not lie straight with respect to each other
according to the neoplatonic metaphysician proclus an angle must be either a quality a quantity or a relationship
the first concept angle as quality was used by eudemus of rhodes who regarded an angle as a deviation from a straight line the second angle as quality by carpus of antioch who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines euclid adopted the third angle as relationship
in mathematical expressions it is common to use greek letters as variables denoting the size of some angle
lower case roman letters are also used
in contexts where this is not confusing an angle may be denoted by the upper case roman letter denoting its vertex
see the figures in this article for examples
in geometric figures angles may also be identified by the three points that define them
for example the angle with vertex a formed by the rays ab and ac is denoted or formula
where there is no risk of confusion the angle may sometimes be referred to by a single vertex alone
potentially an angle denoted as say might refer to any of four angles the clockwise angle from b to c about a the anticlockwise angle from b to c about a the clockwise angle from c to b about a or the anticlockwise angle from c to b about a where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign
however in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to degrees is meant and in these cases no ambiguity arises
otherwise to avoid ambiguity specific conventions may be adopted so that for instance always refers to the anticlockwise angle from b to c about a and the anticlockwise angle from c to b about a
when two straight lines intersect at a point four angles are formed
pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other
a transversal is a line that intersects a pair of lines and is associated with alternate interior angles corresponding angles interior angles and exterior angles
the size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other
angles that have the same size are said to be equal or congruent or equal in measure
in some contexts such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent
in other contexts such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing the cumulative rotation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation angles that differ by a non zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent
in order to measure an angle a circular arc centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn eg with a pair of compasses
the ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the number of radians in the angle formula conventionally in mathematics and in the si the radian is treated as being equal to the dimensionless value
formula the value of thus defined is independent of the size of the circle if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion so the ratio s r is unaltered
the angle addition postulate states that if b is in the interior of angle aoc then formula the measure of the angle aoc is the sum of the measure of angle aob and the measure of angle boc
throughout history angles have been measured in various units
these are known as angular units with the most contemporary units being the degree the radian and the gradian though many others have been used throughout history
most units of angular measurement are defined such that one turn is equal to n units for some whole number n
two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part
in the international system of quantities angle is defined as a dimensionless quantity and in particular the radian unit is dimensionless
this convention impacts how angles are treated in dimensional analysis
for a discussion see
the following table list some units used to represent angles
although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and or rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference
in a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system an angle is typically defined by its two sides with its vertex at the origin
the initial side is on the positive x axis while the other side or terminal side is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians degrees or turns
with positive angles representing rotations toward the positive y axis and negative angles representing rotations toward the negative y axis
when cartesian coordinates are represented by standard position defined by the x axis rightward and the y axis upward positive rotations are anticlockwise and negative rotations are clockwise
in many contexts an angle of is effectively equivalent to an angle of one full turn minus
for example an orientation represented as is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as or
although the final position is the same a physical rotation of is not the same as a rotation of
in three dimensional geometry clockwise and anticlockwise have no absolute meaning so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined in terms of an orientation which is typically defined by a normal vector passing through the angles vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie
in navigation bearings or azimuth are measured relative to north
by convention viewed from above bearing angles are positive clockwise so a bearing of corresponds to a north east orientation
negative bearings are not used in navigation so a north west orientation corresponds to a bearing of
for an angular unit it is definitional that the angle addition postulate holds
some quantities related to angles where the angle addition postulate does not hold include the angle between a line and a curve or between two intersecting curves is defined to be the angle between the tangents at the point of intersection
various names have been given to particular cases amphicyrtic or cissoidal biconvex xystroidal or sistroidal concavo convex amphicoelic or angulus lunularis biconcave
the ancient greek mathematicians knew how to bisect an angle using only a compass and straightedge but could only trisect certain angles
in pierre wantzel showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed
in the euclidean space the angle between two euclidean vectors u and v is related to their dot product and their lengths by the formula formula this formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes from their normal vectors and between skew lines from their vector equations
to define angles in an abstract real inner product space we replace the euclidean dot product by the inner product formula ie formula in a complex inner product space the expression for the cosine above may give non real values so it is replaced with formula or more commonly using the absolute value with formula the latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one dimensional subspaces formula and formula spanned by the vectors formula and formula correspondingly
the definition of the angle between one dimensional subspaces formula and formula given by formula in a hilbert space can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions
given two subspaces formula formula with formula this leads to a definition of formula angles called canonical or principal angles between subspaces
in riemannian geometry the metric tensor is used to define the angle between two tangents
where u and v are tangent vectors and gij are the components of the metric tensor g formula a hyperbolic angle is an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function
the comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case
unlike the circular angle the hyperbolic angle is unbounded
when the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions
this weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by leonhard euler in introduction to the analysis of the infinite
in geography the location of any point on the earth can be identified using a geographic coordinate system
this system specifies the latitude and longitude of any location in terms of angles subtended at the center of the earth using the equator and the greenwich meridian as references
in astronomy a given point on the celestial sphere can be identified using any of several astronomical coordinate systems where the references vary according to the particular system
astronomers measure the angular separation of two stars by imagining two lines through the center of the earth each intersecting one of the stars
the angle between those lines can be measured and is the angular separation between the two stars
in both geography and astronomy a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a vertical angle such as altitude elevation with respect to the horizon as well as the azimuth with respect to north
astronomers also measure the apparent size of objects as an angular diameter
for example the full moon has an angular diameter of approximately when viewed from earth
one could say the moons diameter subtends an angle of half a degree
the small angle formula can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance size ratio
these measurements clearly depend on the individual subject and the above should be treated as rough rule of thumb approximations only
in astronomy right ascension and declination are usually measured in angular units expressed in terms of time based on a hour day
acoustics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases liquids and solids including topics such as vibration sound ultrasound and infrasound
a scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an acoustical engineer
the application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and noise control industries
hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture
accordingly the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society music medicine architecture industrial production warfare and more
likewise animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or for marking territories
art craft science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole as in many other fields of knowledge
robert bruce lindsays wheel of acoustics is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics
the word acoustic is derived from the greek word meaning of or for hearing ready to hear and that from heard audible which in turn derives from the verb i hear
the latin synonym is sonic after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics
frequencies above and below the audible range are called ultrasonic and infrasonic respectively
in the th century bc the ancient greek philosopher pythagoras wanted to know why some combinations of musical sounds seemed more beautiful than others and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the harmonic overtone series on a string
he is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers the tones produced will be harmonious and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds
for example a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length
in modern parlance if a string sounds the note c when plucked a string twice as long will sound a c an octave lower
in one system of musical tuning the tones in between are then given by for d for e for f for g for a and for b in ascending order
aristotle understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it
a very good expression of the nature of wave motion
on things heard generally ascribed to strato of lampsacus states that the pitch is related to the frequency of vibrations of the air and to the speed of sound
in about bc the roman architect and engineer vitruvius wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference echoes and reverberation the beginnings of architectural acoustics
in book v of his de architectura vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions which when interrupted by obstructions would flow back and break up following waves
he described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth fifth and so on up to the double octave in order to resonate with the more desirable harmonious notes
during the islamic golden age ab rayhn al brn is believed to have postulated that the speed of sound was much slower than the speed of light
the physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the scientific revolution
mainly galileo galilei but also marin mersenne independently discovered the complete laws of vibrating strings
galileo wrote waves are produced by the vibrations of a sonorous body which spread through the air bringing to the tympanum of the ear a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics
experimental measurements of the speed of sound in air were carried out successfully between and by a number of investigators prominently mersenne
meanwhile newton derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids a cornerstone of physical acoustics
substantial progress in acoustics resting on firmer mathematical and physical concepts was made during the eighteenth century by euler lagrange and dalembert
during this era continuum physics or field theory began to receive a definite mathematical structure
the wave equation emerged in a number of contexts including the propagation of sound in air
in the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were helmholtz in germany who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics and lord rayleigh in england who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work the theory of sound
also in the th century wheatstone ohm and henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics
the twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place
the first such application was sabines groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics and many others followed
underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first world war
sound recording and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society
sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing
the ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry
new kinds of transducers were invented and put to use
acoustics is defined by ansi asa s as science of sound including its production transmission and effects including biological and psychological effects
those qualities of a room that together determine its character with respect to auditory effects
the study of acoustics revolves around the generation propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations
the steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process
there are many kinds of cause both natural and volitional
there are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy producing a sound wave
there is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation the acoustic wave equation but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex
the wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium
eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms in ways that again may be natural and or volitionally contrived
the final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains
the five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an earthquake a submarine using sonar to locate its foe or a band playing in a rock concert
the central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation
this falls within the domain of physical acoustics
in fluids sound propagates primarily as a pressure wave
in solids mechanical waves can take many forms including longitudinal waves transverse waves and surface waves
acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment
this interaction can be described as either a diffraction interference or a reflection or a mix of the three
if several media are present a refraction can also occur
transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics
in fluids such as air and water sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level
while this disturbance is usually small it is still noticeable to the human ear
the smallest sound that a person can hear known as the threshold of hearing is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure
the loudness of these disturbances is related to the sound pressure level which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels
physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies partly because this is how our ears interpret sound
what we experience as higher pitched or lower pitched sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second
in a common technique of acoustic measurement acoustic signals are sampled in time and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots
both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon
the entire spectrum can be divided into three sections audio ultrasonic and infrasonic
the audio range falls between hz and hz
this range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear
this range has a number of applications including speech communication and music
the ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies hz and higher
this range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies
medical applications such as ultrasonography and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range
on the other end of the spectrum the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range
these frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes
analytic instruments such as the spectrum analyzer facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties
the spectrogram produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character
a transducer is a device for converting one form of energy into another
in an electroacoustic context this means converting sound energy into electrical energy
electroacoustic transducers include loudspeakers microphones particle velocity sensors hydrophones and sonar projectors
these devices convert a sound wave to or from an electric signal
the most widely used transduction principles are electromagnetism electrostatics and piezoelectricity
the transducers in most common loudspeakers are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic voice coil sending off pressure waves
electret microphones and condenser microphones employ electrostatics as the sound wave strikes the microphones diaphragm it moves and induces a voltage change
the ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers
these are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself
an acoustician is an expert in the science of sound
there are many types of acoustician but they usually have a bachelors degree or higher qualification
some possess a degree in acoustics while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as physics or engineering
much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in mathematics and science
many acoustic scientists work in research and development
some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception of speech music and noise
other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments eg underwater acoustics architectural acoustics or structural acoustics
other areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below
acoustic scientists work in government university and private industry laboratories
many go on to work in acoustical engineering
some positions such as faculty require a doctor of philosophy
archaeoacoustics also known as the archaeology of sound is one of the only ways to experience the past with senses other than our eyes
archaeoacoustics is studied by testing the acoustic properties of prehistoric sites including caves
iegor rezkinoff a sound archaeologist studies the acoustic properties of caves through natural sounds like humming and whistling
archaeological theories of acoustics are focused around ritualistic purposes as well as a way of echolocation in the caves
in archaeology acoustic sounds and rituals directly correlate as specific sounds were meant to bring ritual participants closer to a spiritual awakening
parallels can also be drawn between cave wall paintings and the acoustic properties of the cave they are both dynamic
because archaeoacoustics is a fairly new archaeological subject acoustic sound is still being tested in these prehistoric sites today
aeroacoustics is the study of noise generated by air movement for instance via turbulence and the movement of sound through the fluid air
this knowledge is applied in acoustical engineering to study how to quieten aircraft
aeroacoustics is important for understanding how wind musical instruments work
acoustic signal processing is the electronic manipulation of acoustic signals
applications include active noise control design for hearing aids or cochlear implants echo cancellation music information retrieval and perceptual coding
architectural acoustics involves the scientific understanding of how to achieve good sound within a building
it typically involves the study of speech intelligibility speech privacy music quality and vibration reduction in the built environment
commonly studied environments are hospitals classrooms dwellings performance venues recording and broadcasting studios
focus considerations include room acoustics airborne and impact transmission in building structures airborne and structure borne noise control noise control of building systems and electroacoustic systems bioacoustics is the scientific study of the hearing and calls of animal calls as well as how animals are affected by the acoustic and sounds of their habitat
this subdiscipline is concerned with the recording manipulation and reproduction of audio using electronics
this might include products such as mobile phones large scale public address systems or virtual reality systems in research laboratories
environmental acoustics is concerned with noise and vibration caused by railways road traffic aircraft industrial equipment and recreational activities
the main aim of these studies is to reduce levels of environmental noise and vibration
research work now also has a focus on the positive use of sound in urban environments soundscapes and tranquility
musical acoustics is the study of the physics of acoustic instruments the audio signal processing used in electronic music the computer analysis of music and composition and the perception and cognitive neuroscience of music
the goal this acoustics sub discipline is to reduce the impact of unwanted sound
scope of noise studies includes the generation propagation and impact on structures objects and people
noise research investigates the impact of noise on humans and animals to include work in definitions abatement transportation noise hearing protection jet and rocket noise building system noise and vibration atmospheric sound propagation soundscapes and low frequency sound
many studies have been conducted to identify the relationship between acoustics and cognition or more commonly known as psychoacoustics in which what one hears is a combination of perception and biological aspects
the information intercepted by the passage of sound waves through the ear is understood and interpreted through the brain emphasizing the connection between the mind and acoustics
psychological changes have been seen as brain waves slow down or speed up as a result of varying auditory stimulus which can in turn affect the way one thinks feels or even behaves
this correlation can be viewed in normal everyday situations in which listening to an upbeat or uptempo song can cause ones foot to start tapping or a slower song can leave one feeling calm and serene
in a deeper biological look at the phenomenon of psychoacoustics it was discovered that the central nervous system is activated by basic acoustical characteristics of music
by observing how the central nervous system which includes the brain and spine is influenced by acoustics the pathway in which acoustic affects the mind and essentially the body is evident
acousticians study the production processing and perception of speech
speech recognition and speech synthesis are two important areas of speech processing using computers
the subject also overlaps with the disciplines of physics physiology psychology and linguistics
applications might include ground vibrations from railways vibration isolation to reduce vibration in operating theatres studying how vibration can damage health vibration control to protect a building from earthquakes or measuring how structure borne sound moves through buildings
ultrasonics deals with sounds at frequencies too high to be heard by humans
specialisms include medical ultrasonics sonochemistry ultrasonic testing material characterisation and underwater acoustics
underwater acoustics is the scientific study of natural and man made sounds underwater
applications include sonar to locate submarines underwater communication by whales climate change monitoring by measuring sea temperatures acoustically sonic weapons and marine bioacoustics
atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus
atomic physics typically refers to the study of atomic structure and the interaction between atoms
it is primarily concerned with the way in which electrons are arranged around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change
this comprises ions neutral atoms and unless otherwise stated it can be assumed that the term atom includes ions
the term atomic physics can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons due to the synonymous use of atomic and nuclear in standard english
physicists distinguish between atomic physics which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons and nuclear physics which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei
as with many scientific fields strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of atomic molecular and optical physics
physics research groups are usually so classified
atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation
atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons
it is not concerned with the formation of molecules nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter
it is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles
while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time scales for atom atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered
this means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation as the vast majority of the time they are
by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms
electrons form notional shells around the nucleus
these are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light magnetic fields or interaction with a colliding particle
if the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy it will be transferred to an excited state
after a certain time the electron in an excited state will jump to a lower state
in a neutral atom the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy since energy is conserved
if an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital
in this case a visible photon or a characteristic x ray is emitted or a phenomenon known as the auger effect may take place where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron causing it to go into the continuum
the auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon
there are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes
one of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed of atoms
it forms a part of the texts written in th century bc to nd century bc such as those of democritus or written by
this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element by the british chemist and physicist john dalton in the th century
at this stage it wasnt clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties
the invention of the periodic system of elements by dmitri mendeleev was another great step forward
the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon most notably by joseph von fraunhofer
the study of these lines led to the bohr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics
in seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed
as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned not only did this yield a better overall description ie the atomic orbital model but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry and spectroscopy
since the second world war both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace
this can be attributed to progress in computing technology which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes
similar technological advances in accelerators detectors magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work
american sign language is a natural language that serves as the predominant sign language of deaf communities in the united states of america and most of anglophone canada
asl is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features
besides north america dialects of asl and asl based creoles are used in many countries around the world including much of west africa and parts of southeast asia
asl is also widely learned as a second language serving as a lingua franca
asl is most closely related to french sign language
it has been proposed that asl is a creole language of lsf although asl shows features atypical of creole languages such as agglutinative morphology
asl originated in the early th century in the american school for the deaf in hartford connecticut from a situation of language contact
since then asl use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and deaf community organizations
despite its wide use no accurate count of asl users has been taken
reliable estimates for american asl users range from to persons including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals
asl signs have a number of phonemic components such as movement of the face the torso and the hands
asl is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in asl than in spoken languages
english loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling although asl grammar is unrelated to that of english
asl has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers
many linguists believe asl to be a subject verb object language
however there are several alternative proposals to account for asl word order
asl emerged as a language in the american school for the deaf founded by thomas gallaudet in which brought together old french sign language various village sign languages and home sign systems
asl was created in that situation by language contact
asl was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them
the influence of french sign language on asl is readily apparent for example it has been found that about of signs in modern asl are cognate to old french sign language signs
however that is far less than the standard measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects
that suggests that nascent asl was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the asd students although the schools original director laurent clerc taught in lsf
in fact clerc reported that he often learned the students signs rather than conveying lsf it has been proposed that asl is a creole in which lsf is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages
however more recent research has shown that modern asl does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages
asl may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time but it is also possible that it was never a creole type language
there are modality specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face head torso and other body parts
that might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology
additionally clerc and thomas hopkins gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true lsf
although the united states the united kingdom and australia share english as a common oral and written language asl is not mutually intelligible with either british sign language or auslan
all three languages show degrees of borrowing from english but that alone is not sufficient for cross language comprehension
it has been found that a relatively high percentage of asl signs have similar translations in auslan which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family
however that does not seem justified historically for asl and auslan and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with english
american sign language is growing in popularity in many states
many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language but until recently it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective
asl users however have a very distinct culture and they interact very differently when they talk
their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating
they also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart
american sign language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such
in some states however this is only true with regard to high school coursework
prior to the birth of asl sign language had been used by various communities in the united states
in the united states as elsewhere in the world hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation
as early as at first contact by francisco vsquez de coronado there were reports that the indigenous peoples of the great plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines
in the th century a triangle of village sign languages developed in new england one in marthas vineyard massachusetts one in henniker new hampshire and one in sandy river valley maine
marthas vineyard sign language which was particularly important for the history of asl was used mainly in chilmark massachusetts
due to intermarriage in the original community of english settlers of the s and the recessive nature of genetic deafness chilmark had a high rate of genetic deafness
mvsl was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate such as during church sermons or between boats at sea
asl is thought to have originated in the american school for the deaf founded in hartford connecticut in
originally known as the american asylum at hartford for the education and instruction of the deaf and dumb the school was founded by the yale graduate and divinity student thomas hopkins gallaudet
gallaudet inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl alice cogswell traveled to europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from european institutions
ultimately gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the french institut national de jeunes sourds de paris and convinced laurent clerc an assistant to the schools founder charles michel de lpe to accompany him back to the united states
upon his return gallaudet founded the asd on april
the largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from marthas vineyard and they brought mvsl with them
there were also students from around henniker new hampshire and from the sandy river valley in maine each of which had their own village sign language
other students brought knowledge of their own home signs
laurent clerc the first teacher at asd taught using french sign language which itself had developed in the parisian school for the deaf established in
from that situation of language contact a new language emerged now known as asl
more schools for the deaf were founded after asd and knowledge of asl spread to those schools
in addition the rise of deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of asl
societies such as the national association of the deaf and the national fraternal society of the deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country
all of that contributed to asls wide use over a large geographical area atypical of a sign language
while oralism an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language had previously been used in american schools the milan congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the united states and europe
however the efforts of deaf advocates and educators more lenient enforcement of the congress mandate and the use of asl in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to european sign languages albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from english as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language
nevertheless oralism remained the prominent method of deaf education up to the s
linguists did not consider sign language to be true language but as something inferior
recognition of the legitimacy of asl was achieved by william stokoe a linguist who arrived at gallaudet university in when that was still the dominant assumption
aided by the civil rights movement of the s stokoe argued for manualism the use of sign language in deaf education
stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication and even devised a transcription system for asl
in doing so stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics
in the s asl was sometimes referred to as ameslan but that term is now considered obsolete
counting the number of asl signers is difficult because asl users have never been counted by the american census
the ultimate source for current estimates of the number of asl users in the united states is a report for the national census of the deaf population by schein and delk
based on a survey of the ncdp schein and delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between and
the survey did not distinguish between asl and other forms of signing in fact the name asl was not yet in widespread use
incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of asl users in the united states based on misunderstandings of known statistics
demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of asl use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use asl in the home
that accounts for currently cited estimations that are greater than such mistaken estimations can reach as high as
a person lower bound has been cited for asl users the source of that figure is unclear but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing
asl is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third or fourth most spoken language in the united states
those figures misquote schein and delk who actually concluded that asl speakers constituted the third largest population requiring an interpreter in court
although that would make asl the third most used language among monolinguals other than english it does not imply that it is the fourth most spoken language in the united states since speakers of other languages may also speak english
asl is used throughout anglo america
that contrasts with europe where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent
the unique situation of asl seems to have been caused by the proliferation of asl through schools influenced by the american school for the deaf wherein asl originated and the rise of community organizations for the deaf
throughout west africa asl based sign languages are signed by educated deaf adults
such languages imported by boarding schools are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly such as nigerian sign language ghanaian sign language
such signing systems are found in benin burkina faso ivory coast ghana liberia mauritania mali nigeria and togo
due to lack of data it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of asl used in america
in addition to the aforementioned west african countries asl is reported to be used as a first language in barbados bolivia cambodia the central african republic chad china the democratic republic of the congo gabon jamaica kenya madagascar the philippines singapore and zimbabwe
asl is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world widely learned as a second language
sign production can often vary according to location
signers from the south tend to sign with more flow and ease
native signers from new york have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper
sign production of native californian signers has also been reported as being fast
research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas
that conclusion also supports how the ease with which southern sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the south in comparison to that of the coasts
sign production can also vary depending on age and native language
for example sign production of letters may vary in older signers
slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age
additionally signers who learned american sign language as a second language vary in production
for deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning american sign language qualities of their native language may show in their asl production
some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body instead of away from it and signing certain movement from bottom to top instead of top to bottom
hearing people who learn american sign language also have noticeable differences in signing production
the most notable production difference of hearing people learning american sign language is their rhythm and arm posture
most popularly there are variants of the signs for english words such as birthday pizza halloween early and soon just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change
the sign for school is commonly varied between black and white signers
the variation between signs produced by black and white signers is sometimes referred to as black american sign language
social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by deaf gay men for words such as pain and protest
the prevalence of residential deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the united states
deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides
that limited access to signers from other regions combined with the residential quality of deaf schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants
native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education
it is hypothesized that because of that seclusion certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school signers in the community
however american sign language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages
that is because when deaf education was beginning in the united states many educators flocked to the american school for the deaf in hartford connecticut whose central location for the first generation of educators in deaf education to learn american sign language allows asl to be more standardized than its variant
varieties of asl are found throughout the world
there is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the united states and canada
mutual intelligibility among those asl varieties is high and the variation is primarily lexical
for example there are three different words for english about in canadian asl the standard way and two regional variations
variation may also be phonological meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region
for example an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes l and in signs with one handshape
there is also a distinct variety of asl used by the black deaf community
black asl evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states which included the residential schools for the deaf
black asl differs from standard asl in vocabulary phonology and some grammatical structure
while african american english is generally viewed as more innovating than standard english black asl is more conservative than standard asl preserving older forms of many signs
black sign language speakers use more two handed signs than in mainstream asl are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead and use a wider signing space
modern black asl borrows a number of idioms from aae for instance the aae idiom i feel you is calqued into black asl
asl is used internationally as a lingua franca and a number of closely related sign languages derived from asl are used in many different countries
even so there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard asl in those imported asl varieties
bolivian sign language is reported to be a dialect of asl no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects
on the other hand it is also known that some imported asl varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages
for example malaysian sign language which has asl origins is no longer mutually comprehensible with asl and must be considered its own language
for some imported asl varieties such as those used in west africa it is still an open question how similar they are to american asl
when communicating with hearing english speakers asl speakers often use what is commonly called pidgin signed english or contact signing a blend of english structure with asl vocabulary
various types of pse exist ranging from highly english influenced pse to pse which is quite close to asl lexically and grammatically but may alter some subtle features of asl grammar
fingerspelling may be used more often in pse than it is normally used in asl
there have been some constructed sign languages known as manually coded english which match english grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs those systems are not considered to be varieties of asl
tactile asl is a variety of asl used throughout the united states by and with the deaf blind
it is particularly common among those with ushers syndrome
it results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life consequently those with ushers syndrome often grow up in the deaf community using asl and later transition to tasl
tasl differs from asl in that signs are produced by touching the palms and there are some grammatical differences from standard asl in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing
asl changes over time and from generation to generation
the sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed
the development of telephones with screens has also changed asl encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens
in the white house published a response to a petition that gained over signatures to officially recognize american sign language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools
the response is titled there shouldnt be any stigma about american sign language and addressed that asl is a vital language for the deaf and hard of hearing
stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in childrens lives when they can access languages most effectively
scholars such as beth s
benedict advocate not only for bilingualism but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf
york university psychologist ellen bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life
most children born to deaf parents are hearing
known as codas they are often more culturally deaf than deaf children most of whom are born to hearing parents
unlike many deaf children codas acquire asl as well as deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth
such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being slow learners or as having language difficulties because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language
although there is no well established writing system for asl written sign language dates back almost two centuries
the first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of roch ambroise auguste bbian developed in
however written sign language remained marginal among the public
in the s linguist william stokoe created stokoe notation specifically for asl
it is alphabetic with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic hand shape orientation motion and position though it lacks any representation of facial expression and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text
stokoe used that system for his a dictionary of american sign language on linguistic principles
signwriting proposed in by valerie sutton is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the unicode standard
signwriting consists of more than distinct iconic graphs glyphs
currently it is in use in many schools for the deaf particularly in brazil and has been used in international sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than countries including brazil ethiopia france germany italy portugal saudi arabia slovenia tunisia and the united states
sutton signwriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written
the systematic examination of the international sign writing alphabet as an equivalent usage structure to the international phonetic alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed
according to some researchers signwriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one to one map from phonological forms to written forms
that assertion has been disputed and the process for each country to look at the iswa and create a phonemic morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers msc
roberto cesar reis da costa and madson barreto in a thesis forum on june
the signwriting community has an open project on wikimedia labs to support the various wikimedia projects on wikimedia incubator and elsewhere involving signwriting
the asl wikipedia request was marked as eligible in and the test asl wikipedia has articles written in asl using signwriting
the most widely used transcription system among academics is hamnosys developed at the university of hamburg
based on stokoe notation hamnosys was expanded to about graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language
phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol
several additional candidates for written asl have appeared over the years including signfont asl phabet and sis
for english speaking audiences asl is often glossed using english words
such glosses are typically all capitalized and are arranged in asl order
for example the asl sentence dog now chaseix cat meaning the dog is chasing the cat uses now to mark asl progressive aspect and shows asl verbal inflection for the third person
however glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of asl
each sign in asl is composed of a number of distinctive components generally referred to as parameters
a sign may use one hand or both
all signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages which are handshape movement palm orientation location and nonmanual markers
just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like asl
changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign as illustrated by the asl signs think and disappointed there are also meaningful nonmanual signals in asl which may include movement of the eyebrows the cheeks the nose the head the torso and the eyes
william stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages
there has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation
as in spoken languages those phonological units can be split into distinctive features
for instance the handshapes and are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature closed thumb as illustrated to the right
asl has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions
there is ongoing research into whether asl has an analog of syllables in spoken language
asl has a rich system of verbal inflection which involves both grammatical aspect how the action of verbs flows in time and agreement marking
aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb for example continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic circular movement while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position
verbs may agree with both the subject and the object and are marked for number and reciprocity
reciprocity is indicated by using two one handed signs for example the sign shoot made with an l shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb inflects to shoot articulated by having two l shaped hands shooting at each other
asl has a productive system of classifiers which are used to classify objects and their movement in space
for example a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent v classifier handshape with a downhill directed path if the rabbit is hopping the path is executed with a bouncy manner
in general classifiers are composed of a classifier handshape bound to a movement root
the classifier handshape represents the object as a whole incorporating such attributes as surface depth and shape and is usually very iconic
the movement root consists of a path a direction and a manner
in linguistics there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word derivation and inflection
derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category
for example adding the suffix ship to the noun friend creates the new word friendship which has a different meaning than the original word
inflection on the other hand involves modifying a words form to indicate grammatical features such as tense number gender person case and degree of comparison
in american sign language inflection is conveyed through facial expressions body movements and other non manual markers
for instance to indicate past tense in asl one might sign the present tense of a verb and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past
while inflection does not change the basic meaning or category of a word it does provide additional information that helps us better understand how the word is being used in a sentence
this is similar to how subtitles in a movie provide additional information without altering the content of the film itself
according to the book linguistics of american sign language asl signs have two main components hold segments and movement segments
hold segments consist of hand shape location orientation and non manual features while movement segments possess similar features
morphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units
the smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a morpheme with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units while others must occur with other morphemes
for example the plural s and third person s in english are bound morphemes
in asl the handshape in signs like three weeks and three months are also bound morphemes
affixes which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings are part of the derivational process
for example in english prefixes like re and suffixes like able are affixes
in asl affixation can be used to modify the sign for chair to indicate different types of chairs
the inflectional process on the other hand adds grammatical information to existing units
by studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning
understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed
furthermore understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching
for example teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the languages grammar and syntax and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary
in summary morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages
by understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned
asl possesses a set of signs known as the american manual alphabet which can be used to spell out words from the english language
such signs make use of the handshapes of asl
for example the signs for p and k use the same handshape but different orientations
a common misconception is that asl consists only of fingerspelling although such a method has been used it is not asl
fingerspelling is a form of borrowing a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another
in asl fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native asl equivalent
there are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled either very short english words or abbreviations of longer english words eg o n from english on and a p t from english apartment
fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise
asl is a subject verb object language but various phenomena affect that basic word order
basic svo sentences are signed without any pauses however other word orders may also occur since asl allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence initial position a phenomenon known as topicalization
in object subject verb sentences the object is topicalized marked by a forward head tilt and a pause asl also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied rather than stated explicitly
subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence and the subject is then omitted from its original position yielding a verb object subject construction topicalization accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy can produce yet another word order object verb subject
those properties of asl allow it a variety of word orders leading many to question which is the true underlying basic order
there are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in asl
one proposal is that languages like asl are best described with a topic comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties
another hypothesis is that asl exhibits free word order in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods eyebrow movement and body position
common misconceptions are that signs are iconically self explanatory that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean or even that they are pantomime
in fact many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols or their iconicity has been obscured over time
even so in asl iconicity plays a significant role a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way
that may be because the medium of sign three dimensional space naturally allows more iconicity than oral language
in the era of the influential linguist ferdinand de saussure it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary
although onomatopoeia is a clear exception since words like choo choo bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic the saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions
asl with its significant inventory of iconic signs directly challenges that theory
research on acquisition of pronouns in asl has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning
it has been found that when children acquire the pronoun you the iconicity of the point is often confused being treated more like a name
that is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition
it has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs
in computing an applet is any small application that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated widget engine or a larger program often as a plug in
the term is frequently used to refer to a java applet a program written in the java programming language that is designed to be placed on a web page
applets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that dont monopolize the users attention
applets are not full featured application programs and are intended to be easily accessible
the word applet was first used in in pc magazine
however the concept of an applet or more broadly a small interpreted program downloaded and executed by the user dates at least to rfc by jeff rulifson which described the decode encode language which was designed to allow remote use of the on line system over arpanet by downloading small programs to enhance the interaction
this has been specifically credited as a forerunner of javas downloadable programs in rfc
in some cases an applet does not run independently
these applets must run either in a container provided by a host program through a plugin or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model
applets were used to provide interactive features to web applications that historically could not be provided by html alone
they could capture mouse input and also had controls like buttons or check boxes
in response to the user action an applet could change the provided graphic content
this made applets well suited for demonstration visualization and teaching
there were online applet collections for studying various subjects from physics to heart physiology
applets were also used to create online game collections that allowed players to compete against live opponents in real time
an applet could also be a text area only providing for instance a cross platform command line interface to some remote system
if needed an applet could leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window
however applets had very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area so they were less useful for improving the site appearance in general
applets could also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser
html pages could embed parameters that were passed to the applet
hence the same applet could appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed
a java applet is a java program that is launched from html and run in a web browser
it takes code from server and run in a web browser
it can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by html
since javas bytecode is platform independent java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms including windows unix macos and linux
when a java technology enabled web browser processes a page that contains an applet the applets code is transferred to the clients system and executed by the browsers java virtual machine
an html page references an applet either via the deprecated tag or via its replacement the tag
recent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and embedded systems have led to the awareness of the security of applets
applets in an open platform environment should provide secure interactions between different applications
a compositional approach can be used to provide security for open platform applets
advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions
a java applet contains different security models unsigned java applet security signed java applet security and self signed java applet security
in an applet enabled web browser many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets
a malicious applet can infect a computer system in many ways including denial of service invasion of privacy and annoyance
a typical solution for malicious applets is to make the web browser to monitor applets activities
this will result in a web browser that will enable the manual or automatic stopping of malicious applets
alternate history is a genre of speculative fiction of stories in which one or more historical events occur and are resolved differently than in real life
as conjecture based upon historical fact alternate history stories propose what if scenarios about crucial events in human history and present outcomes very different from the historical record
alternate history also is a subgenre of literary fiction science fiction and historical fiction as literature alternate history uses the tropes of the genre to answer the what if speculations of the story
since the s as a subgenre of science fiction alternative history stories feature the tropes of time travel between histories the psychic awareness of the existence of an alternative universe by the inhabitants of a given universe and time travel that divides history into various timestreams
in the spanish french german and portuguese italian catalan and galician languages the terms and identify the alternate history genre from which derives the english term uchronia composed of the greek prefix and the greek word time to describe a story that occurs no time analogous to a story that occurs in utopia is simply a term we use in theology for the view held by some people before arminius and many after him that sinners who hear the gospel have the free will to accept or reject gods offer of saving grace and that nobody is excluded by god from the possibility of salvation except those who freely exclude themselves
but true historical classical arminianism includes the belief that this free will repent and believe unto salvation is itself a gift of god through prevenient grace
depravity is total arminius states in this state the free will of man towards the true good is not only wounded infirm bent and weakened but it is also imprisoned destroyed and lost
and its powers are not only debilitated and useless unless they be assisted by grace but it has no powers whatever except such as are excited by divine grace
atonement is intended for all jesuss death was for all people jesus draws all people to himself and all people have opportunity for salvation through faith
jesuss death satisfies gods justice the penalty for the sins of the elect is paid in full through the crucifixion of christ
thus christs death atones for the sins of all but requires faith to be effected
arminius states that justification when used for the act of a judge is either purely the imputation of righteousness through mercy
or that man is justified before god
according to the rigor of justice without any forgiveness
stephen ashby clarifies arminius allowed for only two possible ways in which the sinner might be justified by our absolute and perfect adherence to the law or purely by gods imputation of christs righteousness
stephen gunter concurs that arminius would not take a rigid position on the doctrine of imputed righteousness
for keith d
stanglin and thomas h
mccall arminius would not object to saying rather that the righteousness of christ is imputed to righteousness
forlines put it this way on the condition of faith we are placed in union with christ
based on that union we receive his death and righteousness
christs atonement has a substitutionary effect which is limited only to the elect
arminius held that gods justice was satisfied by penal substitution
hugo grotius taught that it was satisfied governmentally
according to roger olson historical and contemporary arminians have held to one of these views
grace is resistible god takes initiative in the salvation process and his grace comes to all people
this grace acts on all people to convince them of the gospel draw them strongly towards salvation and enable the possibility of sincere faith
picirilli states that indeed this grace is so close to regeneration that it inevitably leads to regeneration unless finally resisted
the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause effect deterministic method but rather in an influence and response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied
man has a freed will to respond or resist free will is granted and limited by gods sovereignty but gods sovereignty allows all men the choice to accept the gospel of jesus through faith simultaneously allowing all men to resist
conversion is synergistic as roger olson put it evangelical synergism reserves all the power ability and efficacy in salvation to grace but allows humans the god granted ability to resist or not resist it
the only contribution humans make is nonresistance to grace
election is conditional arminius defined election as the decree of god by which of himself from eternity he decreed to justify in christ believers and to accept them unto eternal life
god alone determines who will be saved and his determination is that all who believe jesus through faith will be justified
according to arminius god regards no one in christ unless they are engrafted in him by faith
god predestines the elect to a glorious future predestination is not the predetermination of who will believe but rather the predetermination of the believers future inheritance
the elect are therefore predestined to sonship through adoption glorification and eternal life
related to eschatological considerations jacobus arminius and the first remonstrants including simon episcopius believed in everlasting fire where the wicked are thrown by god at judgment day
preservation is conditional all believers have full assurance of salvation with the condition that they remain in christ
salvation is conditioned on faith therefore perseverance is also conditioned
arminius believed the scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by christ and the holy spirit to fight against satan sin the world and their own flesh and to gain the victory over these enemies
furthermore christ and the spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations
but this security was not unconditional but conditional provided they stand prepared for the battle implore his help and be not wanting to themselves christ preserves them from falling
arminius believed in the possibility for a believer to commit apostasy
however over the period of time arminius wrote on this question he sometimes expressed himself more cautiously out of consideration for the faith of his readers
for instance arminius declared in that this matter required further study in the scriptures
arminius said also in his declaration of sentiments i never taught that a true believer can either totally or finally fall away from the faith and perish yet i will not conceal that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect and those answers to them which i have been permitted to see are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding
but in his other writings he expressed certainty about the possibility of falling away arminius wrote in ca
that a person who is being built into the church of christ may resist the continuation of this process
concerning the believers he said it may suffice to encourage them if they know that no power or prudence can dislodge them from the rock unless they of their own will forsake their position
he continued by saying that the covenant of god does not contain in itself an impossibility of defection from god but a promise of the gift of fear whereby they shall be hindered from going away from god so long as that shall flourish in their hearts
he then taught that had king david died in his sins he would have been lost
in arminius also wrote a believing member of christ may become slothful give place to sin and gradually die altogether ceasing to be a member
for arminius certain class of sin would cause a believer to fall especially sin motivated by malice
in arminius wrote but it is possible for a believer to fall into a mortal sin as is seen in david
therefore he can fall at that moment in which if he were to die he would be condemned
stanglin along with mccall point out that arminius clearly sets forth two paths to apostasy
rejection or
malicious sinning
oropeza concludes if there is any consistency in arminius position he did not seem to deny the possibility of falling away
after the death of arminius in his followers wrote a remonstrance based quite literally on their leaders declaration of sentiments which expressed prudence on the possibility of apostasy
in particular its fifth article expressed the necessity of further study on the possibility of apostasy
sometime between and the official proceeding of the synod of dort the remonstrants became fully persuaded in their minds that the scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever
they formalized their views in the opinion of the remonstrants which was their official stand during the synod of dort
picirilli remarks ever since that early period then when the issue was being examined again arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger
they later expressed this same view in the remonstrant confession
stanglin points out that arminius held that if the apostasy came from malicious sin then it was forgivable
if it came from rejection it was not
following arminius the remonstrants believed that though possible apostasy was not in general irremediable
however other classical arminians as the free will baptists have taught that apostasy is irremediable
john wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what arminius himself taught
wesleyan arminianism is classical arminianism with the addition of wesleyan perfectionism
here are mentioned some positions on specific issues within wesleyan arminianism steven harper proposed that wesleys atonement is a hybrid of the penal substitution theory and the governmental theory
however theologians as robert picirilli roger olson and darren cushman wood consider that the view of wesley concerning atonement is by penal substitution
wesleyan arminians have historically adopted either penal or governmental theory of the atonement
wesley fully accepted the arminian view that genuine christians could apostatize and lose their salvation as his famous sermon a call to backsliders clearly demonstrates
harper summarizes as follows the act of committing sin is not in itself ground for the loss of salvation
the loss of salvation is much more related to experiences that are profound and prolonged
wesley sees two primary pathways that could result in a permanent fall from grace unconfessed sin and the actual expression of apostasy
wesley believed that such apostasy was not irremediable
when talking about those who have made shipwreck of their faith wesley claims that not one or a hundred only but i am persuaded several thousands
innumerable are the instances
of those who had fallen but now stand upright
one issue that typifies wesleyan arminianism is christian perfection
according to wesleys teaching christians could attain a state of practical perfection meaning a lack of all voluntary sin by the empowerment of the holy spirit in this life
christian perfection according to wesley is purity of intention dedicating all the life to god and the mind which was in christ enabling us to walk as christ walked
it is loving god with all our heart and our neighbor as ourselves
it is a restoration not only to the favour but likewise to the image of god our being filled with the fullness of god
wesley was clear that christian perfection did not imply perfection of bodily health or an infallibility of judgment
it also does not mean we no longer violate the will of god for involuntary transgressions remain
perfected christians remain subject to temptation and have continued need to pray for forgiveness and holiness
it is not an absolute perfection but a perfection in love
furthermore wesley did not teach a salvation by perfection but rather says that even perfect holiness is acceptable to god only through jesus christ
the majority arminian view is that election is individual and based on gods foreknowledge of faith
according to the corporate election view god never chose individuals to elect to salvation but rather he chose to elect the believing church to salvation
jesus was the only human ever elected and individuals must be in christ through faith to be part of the elect
corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the old testament and jewish law
identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality
pelagianism is a doctrine denying original sin and total depravity
no system of arminianism founded on arminius or wesley denies original sin or total depravity both arminius and wesley strongly affirmed that mans basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous understand god or seek god
arminius referred to pelagianism as the grand falsehood and stated that he must confess that i detest from my heart the consequences that theology
david pawson a british pastor decries this association as libelous when attributed to arminius or wesleys doctrine
indeed most arminians reject all accusations of pelagianism
some schools of thought notably semi pelagianism which teaches that the first step of salvation is by human will are confused as being arminian in nature
but classical arminianism and wesleyan arminianism hold that the first step of salvation is through the prevenient grace of god though the subsequent grace entails a cooperative relationship
the two systems of calvinism and arminianism share both history and many doctrines and the history of christian theology
however because of their differences over the doctrines of divine predestination and election many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other
the distinction is whether god desires to save all yet allows individuals to resist the grace offered or if god desires to save only some and grace is irresistible to those chosen
many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine while others find them to be relatively minor
the doctrine of open theism states that god is omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient but differs on the nature of the future
open theists claim that the future is not completely determined because people have not made their free decisions yet
god therefore knows the future partially in possibilities rather than solely certainties
some arminians such as professor and theologian robert picirilli reject the doctrine of open theism as a deformed arminianism
joseph dongell stated that open theism actually moves beyond classical arminianism towards process theology
there are also some arminians like roger olson who believe open theism to be an alternative view that a christian can have
the alan parsons project were a british rock band active between and whose core membership consisted of producer audio engineer musician and composer alan parsons and singer songwriter and pianist eric woolfson
they were accompanied by varying session musicians and some relatively consistent session players such as guitarist ian bairnson arranger andrew powell bassist and vocalist david paton drummer stuart elliott and vocalists lenny zakatek and chris rainbow
parsons and woolfson shared writing credits on almost all of the projects songs with parsons producing or co producing all of the bands recordings
the alan parsons project released eleven studio albums in its year career the most successful being i robot and eye in the sky
many of their albums are conceptual in nature and focus on science fiction supernatural literary and sociological themes
among the groups most popular songs are i wouldnt want to be like you games people play time sirius eye in the sky and dont answer me
alan parsons met eric woolfson in the canteen of abbey road studios in the summer of
parsons acted as assistant engineer on the beatles albums abbey road and let it be engineered pink floyds the dark side of the moon and produced several acts for emi records
woolfson a songwriter and composer was working as a session pianist while composing material for a concept album based on the work of edgar allan poe
woolfsons idea was to manage alan and help his already successful production career
this was the start of their longstanding friendly business relationship
he managed parsons career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes including pilot steve harley cockney rebel john miles al stewart ambrosia and the hollies
woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the film industry the focal point of the films promotion shifted from film stars to directors such as alfred hitchcock and stanley kubrick
if the film industry was becoming a directors medium woolfson felt the music business might well become a producers medium
recalling his earlier edgar allan poe material woolfson saw a way to combine his and parsonss talents
parsons produced and engineered songs written and composed by the two and the first alan parsons project was begun
the projects first album tales of mystery and imagination released by th century fox records and including major contributions by all members of pilot and ambrosia was a success reaching the top in the us billboard chart
the song the raven featured lead vocals by the actor leonard whiting
according to the re mastered album liner notes this was the first rock song to use a vocoder with alan parsons speaking lyrics through it although others such as bruce haack pioneered this field in the previous decade
arista records then signed the alan parsons project for further albums
through the late s and early s the projects popularity continued to grow
however the project was always more popular in north america ibero america and continental europe than in parsons home country never achieving a uk top single or top album
the singles i wouldnt want to be like you games people play damned if i do time and eye in the sky had a notable impact on the billboard hot
dont answer me became the projects last successful single in the united states it reached the top on the american charts in
after those successes however the project began to fade from view
there were fewer hit singles and declining album sales
s gaudi was the projects final release though it had planned to record an album called freudiana next
even though the studio version of freudiana was produced by parsons it was primarily woolfsons idea to turn it into a musical
while parsons pursued his own solo career and took many session players of the project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the projects music
freudiana gaudi and gambler were three musicals that included some project songs like eye in the sky time inside looking out and limelight
the live music from gambler was only distributed at the performance site in mnchengladbach germany
in parsons woolfson and their record label arista had been stalled in contract renegotiations when the two submitted an all instrumental album tentatively titled the sicilian defence named after an aggressive opening move in chess arguably to get out of their recording contract
aristas refusal to release the album had two known effects the negotiations led to a renewed contract and the album was not released at that time
in interviews he gave before his death in woolfson said he planned to release one track from the sicilian album which in appeared as a bonus track on a cd re issue of the eve album
sometime later after he had relocated the original tapes parsons reluctantly agreed to release the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming project box set called the complete albums collection in for the first time as a bonus disc
parsons released titles under his name these were try anything once on air the time machine a valid path and the secret
meanwhile woolfson made concept albums titled freudiana about sigmund freuds work on psychology and this continued from the alan parsons projects first album about edgar allan poes literature
tales of mystery and imagination was re mixed in for release on cd and included narration by orson welles recorded in but delivered too late to be included on the original album
for the deluxe edition release parts of this tape were used for the griffith park planetarium launch of the original album the remix and various radio spots
all were included as bonus material
the bands sound is described as progressive rock art rock progressive pop and soft rock
sirius is their best known and most frequently heard of all parsons woolfson songs
it was used as entrance music by various american sports teams notably by the chicago bulls during their s nba dynasty
it was also used as the entrance theme for ricky steamboat in pro wrestling of the mid s
in addition sirius is played in a variety of tv shows and movies including the bbc series record breakers the episode vanishing act of and the film cloudy with a chance of meatballs
vocal duties were shared by guests to complement each song
in later years woolfson sang lead on many of the groups hits including time eye in the sky and dont answer me
the record company pressured parsons to use woolfson more but parsons preferred to use polished proficient singers woolfson admitted he was not in that category
in addition to woolfson vocalists chris rainbow lenny zakatek john miles david paton and colin blunstone are regulars
other singers such as arthur brown steve harley gary brooker dave terry aka elmer gantry vitamin zs geoff barradale and marmalades dean ford recorded only once or twice with the project
parsons sang lead on one song through a vocoder and backing on a few others including to one in paradise
both of those songs appeared on tales of mystery and imagination
parsons also sings a prominent counter melody on time
a variety of session musicians worked with the alan parsons project regularly contributing to the recognizable style of a song despite the varied singer line up
with parsons and woolfson the studio band consisted of the group pilot with ian bairnson david paton and stuart tosh
pilots keyboardist billy lyall contributed
from pyramid onward tosh was replaced by stuart elliott of cockney rebel
bairnson played on all albums and paton stayed almost until the end
andrew powell appeared as arranger of orchestra on all albums except vulture culture he was composing the score of richard donners film ladyhawke
this score was partly in the app style recorded by most of the app regulars and produced and engineered by parsons
powell composed some material for the first two project albums
for vulture culture and later richard cottle played as a regular contributor on synthesizers and saxophone
the alan parsons project played live only once under that name during its original incarnation because woolfson and parsons held the roles of writing and production and because of the technical difficulties of re producing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio
in the s musical production evolved with the technology of digital samplers
the one occasion the band was introduced as the alan parsons project in a live performance was at the night of the proms in october
the concerts featured all project regulars except woolfson present behind the scenes while parsons stayed at the mixer except for the last song when he played acoustic guitar
since alan parsons continues to perform live as the alan parsons live project to be distinct from the alan parsons project
the current line up consists of lead singer pj olsson guitarist jeffrey kollman drummer danny thompson keyboardist tom brooks bass guitarist guy erez vocalist and saxophonist todd cooper and guitarist and vocalist dan tracey
in alan parsons live project played colombia with a full choir and orchestra as alan parsons symphonic project
a cd live set and a dvd version of this concert were released in may
in mathematics the term almost all means all but a negligible quantity
more precisely if formula is a set almost all elements of formula means all elements of formula but those in a negligible subset of formula
the meaning of negligible depends on the mathematical context for instance it can mean finite countable or null
in contrast almost no means a negligible quantity that is almost no elements of formula means a negligible quantity of elements of formula
throughout mathematics almost all is sometimes used to mean all except for finitely many
this use occurs in philosophy as well
similarly almost all can mean all except for countably many
when speaking about the reals sometimes almost all can mean all reals except for a null set
similarly if s is some set of reals almost all numbers in s can mean all numbers in s except for those in a null set
the real line can be thought of as a one dimensional euclidean space
in the more general case of an n dimensional space these definitions can be generalised to all points except for those in a null set or all points in s except for those in a null set
even more generally almost all is sometimes used in the sense of almost everywhere in measure theory or in the closely related sense of almost surely in probability theory
in number theory almost all positive integers can mean the positive integers in a set whose natural density is
that is if a is a set of positive integers and if the proportion of positive integers in a below n tends to as n tends to infinity then almost all positive integers are in a
more generally let s be an infinite set of positive integers such as the set of even positive numbers or the set of primes if a is a subset of s and if the proportion of elements of s below n that are in a tends to as n tends to infinity then it can be said that almost all elements of s are in a
in graph theory if a is a set of graphs it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in a tends to as n tends to infinity
however it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities so the definition is reformulated as follows
the proportion of graphs with n vertices that are in a equals the probability that a random graph with n vertices is in a and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them
therefore equivalently to the preceding definition the set a contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip generated graph with n vertices is in a tends to as n tends to infinity
sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some other way where not all graphs with n vertices have the same probability and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one
the use of the term almost all in graph theory is not standard the term asymptotically almost surely is more commonly used for this concept
in topology and especially dynamical systems theory almost all of a topological spaces points can mean all of the spaces points except for those in a meagre set
some use a more limited definition where a subset contains almost all of the spaces points only if it contains some open dense set
in abstract algebra and mathematical logic if u is an on a set x almost all elements of x sometimes means the elements of some element of u
for any partition of x into two disjoint sets one of them will necessarily contain almost all elements of x
it is possible to think of the elements of a filter on x as containing almost all elements of x even if it isnt an ultrafilter
aromatic compounds also known as mono and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are organic compounds containing one or more aromatic rings
the word aromatic originates from the past grouping of molecules based on smell before their general chemical properties were understood
the current definition of aromatic compounds does not have any relation with their smell
heteroarenes are closely related since at least one carbon atom of ch group is replaced by one of the heteroatoms oxygen nitrogen or sulfur
examples of non benzene compounds with aromatic properties are furan a heterocyclic compound with a five membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom and pyridine a heterocyclic compound with a six membered ring containing one nitrogen atom
hydrocarbons without an aromatic ring are called aliphatic
benzene ch is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon and it was the first one named as such
the nature of its bonding was first recognized by august kekul in the th century
each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share
one goes to the hydrogen atom and one to each of the two neighboring carbons
this leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighboring carbon atoms thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other which is why some representations of the benzene molecule portray it as a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds
other depictions of the structure portray the hexagon with a circle inside it to indicate that the six electrons are floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself
this represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon carbon bonds all of bond order the equivalency is explained by resonance forms
the electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat
the circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by sir robert robinson and his student james armit in and popularized starting in by the morrison boyd textbook on organic chemistry
the proper use of the symbol is debated some publications use it to any cyclic system while others use it only for those systems that obey hckels rule
jensen argues that in line with robinsons original proposal the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic electron systems
in this way the circle symbol for a six center six electron bond can be compared to the y symbol for a three center two electron bond
aromatic ring systems participate in many organic reactions
in aromatic substitution one substituent on the arene ring usually hydrogen is replaced by another substituent
the two main types are electrophilic aromatic substitution when the active reagent is an electrophile and nucleophilic aromatic substitution when the reagent is a nucleophile
in radical nucleophilic aromatic substitution the active reagent is a radical
an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of salicylic acid in coupling reactions a metal catalyzes a coupling between two formal radical fragments
common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new carbon carbon bonds eg alkylarenes vinyl arenes biraryls new carbon nitrogen bonds or new carbon oxygen bonds
an example is a direct arylation of perfluorobenzenes hydrogenation of arenes create saturated rings
the compound naphthol is completely reduced to a mixture of decalin ol isomers
cycloaddition reactions are not common
unusual thermal diels alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the wagner jauregg reaction
other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through excimers
in dearomatization reactions the aromaticity of the reactant is permanently lost
benzene derivatives have from one to six substituents attached to the central benzene core
examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are phenol which carries a hydroxyl group and toluene with a methyl group
when there is more than one substituent present on the ring their spatial relationship becomes important for which the arene substitution patterns ortho meta and para are devised
for example three isomers exist for cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other one position removed from each other or two positions removed from each other
xylenol has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group and for this structure isomers exist
the arene ring has the ability to stabilize charges
this is seen in for example phenol which is acidic at the hydroxyl since a charge on this oxygen is partially delocalized into the benzene ring
other monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon include cyclotetradecaheptaene or cyclooctadecanonaene
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused aromatic rings and do not contain heteroatoms or carry substituents
naphthalene is the simplest example of a pah
pahs occur in oil coal and tar deposits and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning
as pollutants they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic
pahs are also found in cooked foods
studies have shown that high levels of pahs are found for example in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing and in smoked fish
they are also found in the interstellar medium in comets and in meteorites and are a candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life
in graphene the pah motif is extended to large d sheets
an abbey is a type of monastery used by members of a religious order under the governance of an abbot or abbess
abbeys provide a complex of buildings and land for religious activities work and housing of christian monks and nuns
the concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them
religious life in an abbey may be monastic
an abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors
the layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order
abbeys are often self sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy refuge to the persecuted or education to the young
some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat
there are many famous abbeys across the mediterranean basin and europe
the earliest known christian monasteries were groups of huts built near the residence of a famous ascetic or other holy person
disciples wished to be close to their holy man or woman in order to study their doctrine or imitate their way of life
in the earliest times of christian monasticism ascetics would live in social isolation but near a village church
they would subsist whilst donating any excess produce to the poor
however increasing religious fervor about the ascetics ways and or persecution of them would drive them further away from their community and further into solitude
for instance the cells and huts of anchorites have been found in the deserts of egypt
in ad anthony the great retired to the thebaid region of egypt to escape the persecution of the emperor maximian
anthony was the best known of the anchorites of his time due to his degree of austerity sanctity and his powers of exorcism
the deeper he withdrew into the wilderness the more numerous his disciples became
they refused to be separated from him and built their cells close to him
this became a first true monastic community
according to august neander anthony inadvertently became the founder of a new mode of living in common coenobitism
at tabennae on the nile in upper egypt saint pachomius laid the foundations for the coenobitical life by arranging everything in an organized manner
he built several monasteries each with about separate cells laid out in lines
these cells formed an encampment where the monks slept and performed some of their manual tasks
there were nearby large halls such as the church refectory kitchen infirmary and guest house for the monks common needs
an enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village
this layout known as the laurae became popular throughout israel
as well as the laurae communities known as caenobia developed
these were monasteries where monks lived a common life together
the monks were not permitted to retire to the cells of a laurae before they had undergone a lengthy period of training
in time this form of common life superseded that of the older laurae
in the late s ad palladius visited the egyptian monasteries
he described three hundred members of the coenobium of panopolis
there were fifteen tailors seven smiths four carpenters twelve camel drivers and fifteen tanners
these people were divided into subgroups each with its own oeconomus
a chief steward was at the head of the monastery
the produce of the monastery was brought to alexandria for sale
the moneys raised were used to purchase stores for the monastery or were given away as charity
twice in the year the superiors of several coenobia met at the chief monastery under the presidency of an archimandrite in order to make their reports
chrysostom recorded the workings of a coenobia in the vicinity of antioch
the monks lived in separate huts which formed a religious hamlet on the mountainside
they were subject to an abbot and observed a common rule
the layout of the monastic coenobium was influenced by a number of factors
these included a need for defence economy of space and convenience of access
the layout of buildings became compact and orderly
larger buildings were erected and defence was provided by strong outside walls
within the walls the buildings were arranged around one or more open courts surrounded by cloisters
the usual arrangement for monasteries of the eastern world is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the great lavra at mount athos
with reference to the diagram right the convent of the great lavra is enclosed within a strong and lofty blank stone wall
the area within the wall is between three and four acres
the longer side is about in length
there is only one entrance which is located on the north side defended by three iron doors
near the entrance is a large tower a constant feature in the monasteries of the levant
there is a small postern gate at l
the enceinte comprises two large open courts surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone
the outer court which is the larger by far contains the granaries and storehouses the kitchen and other offices connected with the refectory
immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two storied guest house entered from a cloister
the inner court is surrounded by a cloister from which one enters the monks cells
in the centre of this court stands the katholikon or conventual church a square building with an apse of the cruciform domical byzantine type approached by a domed narthex
in front of the church stands a marble fountain covered by a dome supported on columns
opening from the western side of the cloister but actually standing in the outer court is the refectory a large cruciform building about square decorated within with frescoes of saints
at the upper end is a semicircular recess similar to the triclinium of the lateran palace in rome in which is placed the seat of the hegumenos or abbot
this apartment is chiefly used as a meeting place with the monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells
monasticism in the west began with the activities of benedict of nursia
near nursia a town in perugia italy a first abbey was established at monte cassino
between and ad monasteries were built which were spacious and splendid
all the city states of italy hosted a benedictine convent as did the cities of england france and spain
by ad the time of the council of constance benedictine monasteries had been established
the early benedictine monasteries including the first at monte cassino were constructed on the plan of the roman villa
the layout of the roman villa was quite consistent throughout the roman empire and where possible the monks reused available villas in sound repair
this was done at monte cassino
however over time changes to the common villa lay out occurred
the monks required buildings which suited their religious and day to day activities
no overriding specification was demanded of the monks but the similarity of their needs resulted in uniformity of design of abbeys across europe
eventually the buildings of a benedictine abbey were built in a uniform lay out modified where necessary to accommodate local circumstances
the plan of the abbey of saint gall in what is now switzerland indicates the general arrangement of a benedictine monastery of its day
according to the architect robert willis the abbeys lay out is that of a town of individual houses with streets running between them
the abbey was planned in compliance with the benedictine rule that if possible a monastery should be self contained
for instance there was a mill a bakehouse stables and cattle stalls
in all there were thirty three separate structures mostly one level wooden buildings
the abbey church occupied the centre of a quadrangular area about square
on the eastern side of the north transept of the church was the scriptorium or writing room with a library above
the church and nearby buildings ranged about the cloister a court about which there was a covered arcade which allowed sheltered movement between the buildings
the nave of the church was on the north boundary of the cloister
on the east side of the cloister on the ground floor was the pisalis or calefactory
this was a common room warmed by flues beneath the floor
above the common room was the dormitory
the dormitory opened onto the cloister and also onto the south transept of the church
this enabled the monks to attend nocturnal services
a passage at the other end of the dormitory lead to the necessarium
on the south side of the cloister was the refectory
the kitchen at the west end of the refectory was accessed via an anteroom and a long passage
nearby were the bake house brew house and the sleeping rooms of the servants
the upper story of the refectory was called the vestiarium
on the western side of the cloister was another two story building with a cellar on the ground floor and the larder and store room on the upper floor
between this building and the church was a parlour for receiving visitors
one door of the parlour led to the cloisters and the other led to the outer part of the abbey
against the outer wall of the church was a school and headmasters house
the school consisted of a large schoolroom divided in the middle by a screen or partition and surrounded by fourteen little rooms the dwellings of the scholars
the abbots home was near the school
to the north of the church and to the right of the main entrance to the abbey was a residence for distinguished guests
to the left of the main entrance was a building to house poor travellers and pilgrims
there was also a building to receive visiting monks
these hospitia had a large common room or refectory surrounded by bed rooms
each hospitium had its own brewhouse and bakehouse and the building for more prestigious travellers had a kitchen and storeroom with bedrooms for the guests servants and stables for their horses
the monks of the abbey lived in a house built against the north wall of the church
the whole of the southern and western areas of the abbey were devoted to workshops stables and farm buildings including stables ox sheds goatstables piggeries and sheep folds as well as the servants and labourers quarters
in the eastern part of the abbey there was a group of buildings representing in layout two complete miniature monasteries
that is each had a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings such as the church the refectory the dormitory and so on
a detached building belonging to each contained a bathroom and a kitchen
one of the miniature complexes was called the oblati
these were the buildings for the novices
the other complex was a hospital or infirmary for the care of sick monks
this infirmary complex included a physicians residence a physic garden a drug store and a chamber for the critically ill
there was also a room for bloodletting and purging
the physic garden occupied the north east corner of the abbey
in the southernmost area of the abbey was the workshop containing utilities for shoemakers saddlers cutlers and grinders trencher makers tanners curriers fullers smiths and goldsmiths
the tradesmens living quarters were at the rear of the workshop
here there were also farm buildings a large granary and threshing floor mills and malthouse
at the south east corner of the abbey were hen and duck houses a poultry yard and the dwelling of the keeper
nearby was the kitchen garden which complemented the physic garden and a cemetery orchard
every large monastery had priories
a priory was a smaller structure or entities which depended on the monastery
some were small monasteries accommodating five or ten monks
others were no more than a single building serving as residence or a farm offices
the outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as villae or granges
they were usually staffed by lay brothers sometimes under the supervision of a monk
many of todays cathedrals in england were originally benedictine monasteries
these included canterbury chester durham ely gloucester norwich peterborough rochester winchester and worcester
shrewsbury abbey in shropshire was founded as a benedictine monastery by the normans in
westminster abbey was founded in the tenth century by saint dunstan who established a community of benedictine monks
the only traces of st dunstans monastery remaining are round arches and massive supporting columns of the undercroft and the pyx chamber
the cloister and buildings lie directly to the south of the church
parallel to the nave on the south side of the cloister was a refectory with a lavatory at the door
on the eastern side there was a dormitory raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept and a chapter house
a small cloister lay to the south east of the large cloister
beyond that was an infirmary with a table hall and a refectory for those who were able to leave their chambers
at the west entrance to the abbey there was a house and a small courtyard for the abbot
in st marys abbey york was built in englands north by the order of saint benedict
it followed the common plan
the entrance to the abbey was through a strong gate on the northern side
close to the entrance was a chapel
this was for visitors arriving at the abbey to make their devotions
near the gate was the hospitium
the buildings are completely ruined but the walls of the nave and the cloisters are still visible on the grounds of the yorkshire museum
the abbey was surrounded by fortified walls on three sides
the river ouse bordered the fourth side
the stone walls remain as an excellent example of english abbey walls
the abbey of cluny was founded by william i duke of aquitaine in ad at cluny sane et loire france
the abbey was built in the romanesque style
the abbey was noted for its strict observance of the rule of saint benedict
however reforms resulted in many departures from this precedent
the cluniac reforms brought focus to the traditions of monastic life encouraging art and the caring of the poor
the reforms quickly spread by the founding of new abbey complexes and by adoption of the reforms by existing abbeys
by the twelfth century the abbey of cluny was the head of an order consisting of monasteries
the church at the abbey was commenced in ad by hugh of cluny the sixth abbot
it was finished and consecrated by pope innocent ii around ad
the church was regarded as one of the wonders of the middle ages
at in length it was the largest church in christendom until the completion of st peters basilica at rome
the church consisted of five naves a narthex which was added in ad and several towers
together with the conventual buildings it covered an area of twenty five acres
in the dechristianization of france during the french revolution in ad the abbey church was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed
the first english house of the cluniac order was built at lewes sussex
it was founded by william de warenne st earl of surrey in about ad
all but one of the cluniac houses in britain were known as priories symbolizing their subordination to the abbot of cluny
all the cluniac houses in england and scotland were french colonies governed by french priors who travelled to the abbey of cluny to consult or be consulted
the priory at paisley was an exception
in ad it was raised to the status of an abbey answerable only to the pope
the augustinian canons were an order of regular clergy within the hierarchy of the catholic church
they held a position between monks and secular canons
they were known as black canons because of the colour of their habits
in ad the first house of the order was established at st botolphs priory colchester essex
the canons built very long naves to accommodate large congregations
the choirs were also long
sometimes as at llanthony priory and christchurch dorset the choir was closed from the aisles
at other abbeys of the order such as bolton abbey or kirkham priory there were no aisles
the nave in the northern houses of the order often had only a north aisle
the arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary plan
the priors lodge was usually attached to the southwest angle of the nave
the austin canons house at thornton lincolnshire had a large and magnificent gatehouse
the upper floors of the gatehouse formed the guest house
the chapter house was octagonal in shape
the premonstratensian regular canons or white canons were of an order founded in ad by norbert of xanten
the order was a reformed branch of the augustinian canons
from a marshy area in the forest of coucy in the diocese of laon the order spread widely
even in norberts lifetime the order had built abbeys in aleppo syria and in the kingdom of jerusalem
of the abbey of saint samuel denys pringle wrote the premonstatensian abbey of saint samuel was a daughter house of prmontr itself
its abbot had the status of a suffragan of the patriarch of jerusalem with the right to a cross but not to a mitre nor a ring
it long maintained its rigid austerity though in later years the abbey grew wealthier and its members indulged in more frequent luxuries
just after ad the premonstratensians were brought to england
their first settlement was at newhouse abbey lincolnshire near the humber tidal estuary
there were as many as thirty five premonstratensian abbeys in england
the head abbey in england was at welbeck abbey but the best preserved are easby abbey in yorkshire and bayham old abbey in kent
the layout of easby abbey is irregular due to its position on the edge of a steep river bank
the cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions around it
however the cloister garth as at chichester is not rectangular and thus all the surrounding buildings are positioned in an awkward fashion
the church follows the plan adopted by the austin canons in their northern abbeys and has only one aisle to the north of the nave while the choir is long narrow and without an aisle
each transept has an aisle to the east forming three chapels
the church at bayham old abbey had no aisles in the nave or the choir
the latter terminated in a three sided apse
the church is remarkable for its extreme narrowness in proportion to its length
while the building is long it is not more than wide
premonstratensian canons did not care to have congregations nor possessions
therefore they built their churches in the shape of a long room
the cistercians a benedictine reform group were established at cteaux in ad by robert of molesme abbot of molesme for the purpose of restoring as far as possible the literal observance of the rule of saint benedict
la fert pontigny clairvaux and morimond were the first four abbeys to follow cteauxs example and others followed
the monks of cteaux created the well known vineyards of clos vougeot and romane in burgundy
the cistercian principle of rigid self abnegation carried over to the design of the orders churches and buildings
the defining architectural characteristic of the cistercian abbeys was extreme simplicity and plainness
only a single central tower was permitted and that was usually very low
unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited
the triforium was omitted
the windows were usually plain and undivided and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass
all needless ornament was proscribed
the crosses were made of wood and the candlesticks of iron
the same principle governed the choice of site for cistercian abbeys in that a most dismal site might be improved by the building of an abbey
the cistercian monasteries were founded in deep well watered valleys always standing at a streams edge
the building might extend over the water as is the case at fountains abbey
these valleys now rich and productive had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat
wide swamps deep morasses tangled thickets and wild impassable forests were their prevailing features
clara vallis of st bernard now the bright valley was originally the valley of wormwood
it was an infamous den of robbers
the plan of a coptic orthodox monastery from lenoir shows a church of three aisles with cellular apses and two ranges of cells on either side of an oblong gallery
the annales school is a group of historians associated with a style of historiography developed by french historians in the th century to stress long term social history
it is named after its scholarly journal annales dhistoire conomique et sociale which remains the main source of scholarship along with many books and monographs
the school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in france and numerous other countries especially regarding the use of social scientific methods by historians emphasizing social and economic rather than political or diplomatic themes
the school deals primarily with late medieval and early modern europe with little interest in later topics
it has dominated french social history and heavily influenced historiography in europe and latin america
prominent leaders include co founders lucien febvre henri hauser and marc bloch
the second generation was led by fernand braudel and included georges duby pierre goubert robert mandrou pierre chaunu jacques le goff and ernest labrousse
institutionally it is based on the annales journal the sevpen publishing house the and especially the th section of the cole pratique des hautes tudes all based in paris
a third generation was led by emmanuel le roy ladurie and includes jacques revel and philippe aris who joined the group in
the third generation stressed history from the point of view of mentalities or mentalits
the fourth generation of annales historians led by roger chartier clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach replaced by the cultural and linguistic turn which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices
the main scholarly outlet has been the journal annales dhistoire economique et sociale founded in by lucien febvre and marc bloch which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities
its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices
janmesh kokate was editor of annales committee from to present followed by the medievalist jacques le goff
however informal successor as head of the school was le roy ladurie
multiple responses were attempted by the school
scholars moved in multiple directions covering in disconnected fashion the social economic and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe
by the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across france europe and the rest of the world
influence indeed spread out from paris but few new ideas came in
much emphasis was given to quantitative data seen as the key to unlocking all of social history
however the annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the us and britain which reshaped economic political and demographic research
an attempt to require an annales written textbook for french schools was rejected by the government
by postmodern sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives
as jacques revel notes the success of the annales school especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces contained the seeds of its own downfall for there is no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social identified with the real
the annales school kept its infrastructure but lost its mentalits
the journal began in strasbourg as annales dhistoire conomique et sociale it moved to paris and kept the same name from to
it was successively renamed annales dhistoire sociale mlanges dhistoire sociale annales
economies socits civilisations and annales
histoire sciences sociales
in braudel and gaston berger used ford foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation the which braudel directed from until his death
in the th section and the annales relocated to the fmsh building
fmsh set up elaborate international networks to spread the annales gospel across europe and the world
in it began publication of an english language edition with all the articles translated
the scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental there is a search for total history and new approaches
the emphasis is on social history and very long term trends often using quantification and paying special attention to geography and to the intellectual world view of common people or mentality
little attention is paid to political diplomatic or military history or to biographies of famous men
instead the annales focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social economic and cultural history statistics medical reports family studies and even psychoanalysis
the annales was founded and edited by marc bloch and lucien febvre in while they were teaching at the university of strasbourg and later in paris
these authors the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist quickly became associated with the distinctive annales approach which combined geography history and the sociological approaches of the anne sociologique to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics diplomacy and war of many th and early th century historians as spearheaded by historians whom febvre called les sorbonnistes
instead they pioneered an approach to a study of long term historical structures over events and political transformations
geography material culture and what later annalistes called mentalits or the psychology of the epoch are also characteristic areas of study
the goal of the annales was to undo the work of the sorbonnistes to turn french historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history
co founder marc bloch was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite cole normale suprieure and in germany serving as a professor at the university of strasbourg until he was called to the sorbonne in paris in as professor of economic history
blochs interests were highly interdisciplinary influenced by the geography of paul vidal de la blache and the sociology of mile durkheim
his own ideas especially those expressed in his masterworks french rural history and feudal society were incorporated by the second generation annalistes led by fernand braudel
the annalistes especially lucien febvre advocated a histoire totale or histoire tout court a complete study of a historic problem
bloch was shot by the gestapo during the german occupation of france in world war ii for his active membership of the french resistance and febvre carried on the annales approach in the s and s
it was during this time that he mentored braudel who would become one of the best known exponents of this school
braudels work came to define a second era of annales historiography and was very influential throughout the s and s especially for his work on the mediterranean region in the era of philip ii of spain
braudel developed the idea often associated with annalistes of different modes of historical time lhistoire quasi immobile of historical geography the history of social political and economic structures and the history of men and events in the context of their structures
while authors such as emmanuel le roy ladurie marc ferro and jacques le goff continue to carry the annales banner today the annales approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in cultural history political history and economic history
blochs les rois thaumaturges looked at the long standing folk belief that the king could cure scrofula by his thaumaturgic touch
the kings of france and england indeed regularly practiced the ritual
bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner
the book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies as well as long durations studies spanning several centuries even up to a thousand years downplaying short term events
blochs revolutionary charting of mentalities or mentalits resonated with scholars who were reading freud and proust
in the s robert mandrou and georges duby harmonized the concept of mentalit history with fernand braudels structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions
a flood of mentalit studies based on these approaches appeared during the s and s
by the s however mentalit history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation but still lacked a solid theoretical basis
while not explicitly rejecting mentalit history younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches
fernand braudel became the leader of the second generation after
he obtained funding from the rockefeller foundation in new york and founded the th section of the ecole pratique des hautes etudes which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences
it became an independent degree granting institution in under the name cole des hautes tudes en sciences sociales
braudels followers admired his use of the longue dure approach to stress slow and often imperceptible effects of space climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past
the annales historians after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in france were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history
they preferred to stress inertia and the longue dure
special attention was paid to geography climate and demography as long term factors
they believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors especially the will of revolutionaries
they rejected the marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions
in turn the marxists called them conservatives
braudels first book la mditerrane et le monde mditerranen lepoque de philippe ii was his most influential
this vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences employed effectively the technique of the longue dure and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals
it stressed geography but not mentalit
it was widely admired but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs
the book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the annales school
in historian bernard bailyn published a critique of la mditerrane et le monde mditerranen lepoque de philippe ii which he framed as dichotomizing politics and society
before annales french history supposedly happened in paris
febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in with his sweeping doctoral thesis on philippe ii et la franche comt
the geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the kings policies
the annales historians did not try to replicate braudels vast geographical scope in la mditerrane
instead they focused on regions in france over long stretches of time
the most important was the study of the peasants of languedoc by braudels star pupil and successor emmanuel le roy ladurie
the regionalist tradition flourished especially in the s and s in the work of pierre goubert in on beauvais and ren baehrel on basse provence
annales historians in the s and s turned to urban regions including pierre deyon maurice garden jean pierre bardet georges freche gregory hanlon and jean claude perrot
by the s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities
the annales school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries
its success varied widely
the annales approach was especially well received in italy and poland
franciszek bujak and jan rutkowski the founders of modern economic history in poland and of the journal roczniki dziejw spolecznych i gospodarczych were attracted to the innovations of the annales school
rutkowski was in contact with bloch and others and published in the annales
after the communists took control in the s polish scholars were safer working on the middle ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history
after the polish october of the sixth section in paris welcomed polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the annales and polish scholars continued until the early s
the reciprocal influence between the french school and polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the middle ages and the early modern era studied by braudel
in south america the annales approach became popular
from the s federico brito figueroa was the founder of a new venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the annales school
brito figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences
spanish historiography was influenced by the annales school starting in with jaime vincens vives
in mexico exiled republican intellectuals extended the annales approach particularly from the center for historical studies of el colegio de mxico the leading graduate studies institution of latin america
british historians apart from a few marxists were generally hostile
academic historians decidedly sided with geoffrey eltons the practice of history against edward hallett carrs what is history one of the few british historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the annales school was hugh trevor roper
american german indian russian and japanese scholars generally ignored the school
the americans developed their own form of new social history from entirely different roots
both the american and the annales historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from french demographer louis henry
the wageningen school centered on bernard slicher van bath was viewed internationally as a dutch counterpart of the annales school although slicher van bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative school of historiography
has been cited as a key influence in the development of world systems theory by sociologist immanuel wallerstein
the current leader is roger chartier who is directeur dtudes at the cole des hautes tudes en sciences sociales in paris professeur in the collge de france and annenberg visiting professor of history at the university of pennsylvania
he frequently lectures and teaches in the united states spain mexico brazil and argentina
his work in early modern european history focuses on the history of education the history of the book and the history of reading
recently he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature for france england and spain
his work in this specific field is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines philosophy sociology anthropology
chartiers typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making remaking dissemination and reading of texts in early modern europe and america
under the heading of practices his class considers how readers read and marked up their books forms of note taking and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts
under the heading of materials his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces writing implements and material forms
under the heading of places his class explores where texts were made read and listened to including monasteries schools and universities offices of the state the shops of merchants and booksellers printing houses theaters libraries studies and closets
the texts for his course include the bible translations of ovid hamlet don quixote montaignes essays pepyss diary richardsons pamela and franklins autobiography
in modern physics antimatter is defined as matter composed of the antiparticles of the corresponding particles in ordinary matter and can be thought of as matter with reversed charge parity and time known as cpt reversal
antimatter occurs in natural processes like cosmic ray collisions and some types of radioactive decay but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form antiatoms
minuscule numbers of antiparticles can be generated at particle accelerators however total artificial production has been only a few nanograms
no macroscopic amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling
in theory a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass but opposite electric charge and other differences in quantum numbers
a collision between any particle and its anti particle partner leads to their mutual annihilation giving rise to various proportions of intense photons neutrinos and sometimes less massive particleantiparticle pairs
the majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of ionizing radiation
if surrounding matter is present the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light
the amount of energy released is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter in accordance with the notable mass energy equivalence equation
antiparticles bind with each other to form antimatter just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter
for example a positron and an antiproton can form an antihydrogen atom
the nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced albeit with difficulty and are the most complex anti nuclei so far observed
physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible as well as anti atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements
there is strong evidence that the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter
this asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics
the process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called baryogenesis
antimatter particles carry the same charge as matter particles but of opposite sign
that is an antiproton is negatively charged and an antielectron is positively charged
neutrons do not carry a net charge but their constituent quarks do
protons and neutrons have a baryon number of while antiprotons and antineutrons have a baryon number of
similarly electrons have a lepton number of while that of positrons is
when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle collide they are both converted into energy
the french term led to the initialism ct and the science fiction term seetee as used in such novels as seetee ship
the idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned
using the once popular vortex theory of gravity the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by william hicks in the s
between the s and the s karl pearson proposed the existence of squirts and sinks of the flow of aether
the squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter
pearsons theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into
the term antimatter was first used by arthur schuster in two rather whimsical letters to nature in in which he coined the term
he hypothesized antiatoms as well as whole antimatter solar systems and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other
schusters ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal merely speculation and like the previous ideas differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed negative gravity
the modern theory of antimatter began in with a paper by paul dirac
dirac realised that his relativistic version of the schrdinger wave equation for electrons predicted the possibility of antielectrons
these were discovered by carl d
anderson in and named positrons from positive electron
although dirac did not himself use the term antimatter its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons antiprotons etc
a complete periodic table of antimatter was envisaged by charles janet in
the feynman stueckelberg interpretation states that antimatter and antiparticles are regular particles traveling backward in time
one way to denote an antiparticle is by adding a bar over the particles symbol
for example the proton and antiproton are denoted as and respectively
the same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components
a proton is made up of quarks so an antiproton must therefore be formed from antiquarks
another convention is to distinguish particles by positive and negative electric charge
thus the electron and positron are denoted simply as and respectively
to prevent confusion however the two conventions are never mixed
theorized anti gravitational properties of antimatter are currently being tested at the aegis and alpha g experiments at cern
research is needed to study the possible gravitational effects between matter and antimatter and between antimatter and antimatter
however research is difficult considering when the two meet they annihilate along with the current difficulties of capturing and containing antimatter
there are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties
this means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes
it also implies that for example a star made up of antimatter will shine just like an ordinary star
this idea was tested experimentally in by the alpha experiment which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of antihydrogen
the results which are identical to that of hydrogen confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter
most matter observable from the earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter
if antimatter dominated regions of space existed the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable
antiparticles are created everywhere in the universe where high energy particle collisions take place
high energy cosmic rays striking earths atmosphere produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting particle jets which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter
they may similarly be produced in regions like the center of the milky way and other galaxies where very energetic celestial events occur
the presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two gamma rays produced every time positrons annihilate with nearby matter
the frequency and wavelength of the gamma rays indicate that each carries kev of energy
observations by the european space agencys integral satellite may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center
the observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of x ray binaries mostly on one side of the galactic center
while the mechanism is not fully understood it is likely to involve the production of electron positron pairs as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a stellar remnant
antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial time of the universe
antimatter galaxies if they exist are expected to have the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal matter galaxies and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical making them difficult to distinguish
nasa is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for x ray and gamma ray signatures of annihilation events in colliding superclusters
in october scientists working on the base experiment at cern reported a measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment to a precision of parts per billion
it is consistent with the most precise measurement of the proton magnetic moment which supports the hypothesis of cpt symmetry
this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter
antimatter quantum interferometry has been first demonstrated in in the positron laboratory of rafael ferragut in como by a group led by marco giammarchi
positrons are produced naturally in decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes and in interactions of gamma quanta with matter
antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity
many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by cosmic rays
in january research by the american astronomical society discovered antimatter originating above thunderstorm clouds positrons are produced in terrestrial gamma ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds
antiprotons have also been found to exist in the van allen belts around the earth by the pamela module
antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature
it is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis when the universe was extremely hot and dense matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated
the presence of remaining matter and absence of detectable remaining antimatter is called baryon asymmetry
the exact mechanism that produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem
one of the necessary conditions for this asymmetry is the violation of cp symmetry which has been experimentally observed in the weak interaction
recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron electron plasma via the jets
satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays amounting to less than of the particles in primary cosmic rays
this antimatter cannot all have been created in the big bang but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies
for instance electron positron pairs may be formed in pulsars as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron positron pairs from the star surface
therein the antimatter forms a wind that crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae
this weathering takes place as the cold magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non relativistically expanding ejecta a shock wave system forms in the impact the outer one propagates in the ejecta while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star
the former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle
preliminary results from the presently operating alpha magnetic spectrometer on board the international space station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality and with energies that range from gev to gev
in september new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at cern and published in physical review letters
a new measurement of positron fraction up to gev was reported showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about of total electronpositron events around an energy of gev
at higher energies up to gev the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again
the absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before gev but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies which peak about gev
these results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles
cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal matter counterparts
they arrive at earth with a characteristic energy maximum of gev indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons which on average have only one sixth of the energy
there is an ongoing search for larger antimatter nuclei such as antihelium nuclei in cosmic rays
the detection of natural antihelium could imply the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar
a prototype of the ams designated ams was flown into space aboard the on sts in june
by not detecting any antihelium at all the ams established an upper limit of for the antihelium to helium flux ratio
ams revealed in december that it had discovered a few signals consistent with antihelium nuclei amidst several billion helium nuclei
the result remains to be verified and the team is currently trying to rule out contamination
positrons were reported in november to have been generated by lawrence livermore national laboratory in larger numbers than by any previous synthetic process
a laser drove electrons through a gold targets nuclei which caused the incoming electrons to emit energy quanta that decayed into both matter and antimatter
positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory
previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper thin targets newer simulations showed that short bursts of ultra intense lasers and millimeter thick gold are a far more effective source
the existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in by university of california berkeley physicists emilio segr and owen chamberlain for which they were awarded the nobel prize in physics
an antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark
the properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton
shortly afterwards in the antineutron was discovered in proton proton collisions at the bevatron by bruce cork and colleagues
in addition to antibaryons anti nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created
these are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms
in a group of researchers led by antonino zichichi reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the proton synchrotron at cern
at roughly the same time observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of american physicists at the alternating gradient synchrotron at brookhaven national laboratory
in cern announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the slac fermilab concept during the ps experiment
the experiment was performed using the low energy antiproton ring and was led by walter oelert and mario macri
fermilab soon confirmed the cern findings by producing approximately antihydrogen atoms at their facilities
the antihydrogen atoms created during ps and subsequent experiments were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study
to resolve this hurdle and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen two collaborations were formed in the late s namely athena and atrap
in cern activated the antiproton decelerator a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from to still too hot to produce study effective antihydrogen but a huge leap forward
in late the athena project announced that they had created the worlds first cold antihydrogen
the atrap project released similar results very shortly thereafter
the antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the antiproton decelerator passing them through a thin sheet of foil and finally capturing them in a penning malmberg trap
the overall cooling process is workable but highly inefficient approximately million antiprotons leave the antiproton decelerator and roughly make it to the penning malmberg trap which is about or of the original amount
the antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped
to cool them further they are mixed into an electron plasma
the electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via coulomb collisions
eventually the electrons are removed by the application of short duration electric fields leaving the antiprotons with energies less than
while the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap a small cloud of positrons is captured from radioactive sodium in a surko style positron accumulator
this cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons
manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen
this neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls where it annihilates
some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion
in athena disbanded and some of the former members formed the alpha collaboration which is also based at cern
the ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test cpt symmetry through comparison of the atomic spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen
most of the sought after high precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped that is held in place for a relatively long time
while antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral the spins of their component particles produce a magnetic moment
these magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum
such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields
antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum trap in november the alpha collaboration announced that they had so trapped antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a second
this was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped
on april alpha announced that they had trapped antihydrogen atoms some for as long as seconds
this was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped before
alpha has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of the antihydrogen
in a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called elena was built
it takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to kev which is cold enough to study
this machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber
more than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second a huge improvement but it would still take several thousand years to make a nanogram of antimatter
the biggest limiting factor in the large scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons
recent data released by cern states that when fully operational their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute
assuming a conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen it would take billion years to produce gram or mole of antihydrogen
however cern only produces of the anti matter fermilab does and neither are designed to produce anti matter
according to gerald jackson using technology already in use today we are capable of producing and capturing grams of anti matter particles per year at a yearly cost of million dollars per facility
antihelium nuclei were first observed in the s in proton nucleus collision experiments at the institute for high energy physics by y
prockoshkins group and later created in nucleus nucleus collision experiments
nucleus nucleus collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescence of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions
in the star detector reported the observation of artificially created antihelium nuclei from such collisions
the alpha magnetic spectrometer on the international space station has as of recorded eight events that seem to indicate the detection of antihelium
antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container
antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields in a device called a penning trap
this device cannot however contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles for which atomic traps are used
in particular such a trap may use the dipole moment of the trapped particles
at high vacuum the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off resonant laser radiation using a magneto optical trap or magnetic trap
small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers using a highly focused laser beam
in cern scientists were able to preserve antihydrogen for approximately minutes
the record for storing antiparticles is currently held by the trap experiment at cern antiprotons were kept in a penning trap for days
a proposal was made in to develop containment technology advanced enough to contain a billion anti protons in a portable device to be driven to another lab for further experimentation
scientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make
in gerald smith estimated million could produce milligrams of positrons in nasa gave a figure of trillion per gram of antihydrogen
this is because production is difficult and because there is higher demand for other uses of particle accelerators
according to cern it has cost a few hundred million swiss francs to produce about billionth of a gram
in comparison to produce the first atomic weapon the cost of the manhattan project was estimated at billion with inflation during
several studies funded by the nasa institute for advanced concepts are exploring whether it might be possible to use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the van allen belt of the earth and ultimately the belts of gas giants like jupiter hopefully at a lower cost per gram
matter antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging such as positron emission tomography
in positive beta decay a nuclide loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron
nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a cyclotron and are widely generated for medical use
antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers in a similar method currently used for ion therapy
isolated and stored antimatter could be used as a fuel for interplanetary or interstellar travel as part of an antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion or another antimatter rocket
since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels an antimatter fueled spacecraft would have a higher thrust to weight ratio than a conventional spacecraft
if matter antimatter collisions resulted only in photon emission the entire rest mass of the particles would be converted to kinetic energy
the energy per unit mass is about orders of magnitude greater than chemical energies and about orders of magnitude greater than the nuclear potential energy that can be liberated today using nuclear fission and about orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from fusion
the reaction of of antimatter with of matter would produce of energy or the rough equivalent of megatons of tnt slightly less than the yield of the kg tsar bomba the largest thermonuclear weapon ever detonated
not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products
while electron positron reactions result in gamma ray photons these are difficult to direct and use for thrust
in reactions between protons and antiprotons their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged pions
the neutral pions decay almost immediately into high energy photons but the charged pions decay more slowly and can be deflected magnetically to produce thrust
charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of neutrinos and unstable charged muons with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons positrons and neutrinos
antimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons
a major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible
nonetheless the us air force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the cold war and began considering its possible use in weapons not just as a trigger but as the explosive itself
the local name for the building is as it has a visceral skeletal organic quality
it is located on the in the eixample district and forms part of a row of houses known as the which consists of four buildings by noted architects of barcelona
like everything gaud designed is only identifiable as in the broadest sense
the ground floor in particular has unusual tracery irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work
there are few straight lines and much of the faade is decorated with a colorful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles
the roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur
a common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre terminating at the top in a turret and cross represents the lance of saint george which has been plunged into the back of the dragon
in became an unesco world heritage site among the other works of antoni gaud and is visited by people from around the world
the building that is now was built in commissioned by llus sala snchez
it was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the eclecticism traditional by the end of the th century
the building had a basement a ground floor four other floors and a garden in the back
the house was bought by josep batll in
the design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the batll family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location
it is located in the middle of which in the early th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area
it was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves
in josep batll still owned the home
the batll family was very well known in barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city
mr josep batll i casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city
mr batll married amlia god belaunzarn from the family that founded the newspaper la vanguardia
josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative
both josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit gaud
josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the batll family such as casa pa built by the josep vilaseca
he chose the architect who had designed park gell because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan
the family lived on the principal floor of until the middle of the s
in josep batll hired gaud to design his home at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house
gaud convinced josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year
the building was completed and refurbished in
he completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the batll family
he expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors
in the same year the barcelona city council selected the house as a candidate for that years best building award
the award was given to another architect that year despite gauds design
josep batll died in and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in
after the death of the two parents the house was kept and managed by the children until
in an insurance company named seguros iberia acquired casa batll and set up offices there
in the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house
in the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior faade was illuminated in the ceremony of la merc
in the current owners of casa batll bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building
two years later in casa batll began to hire out its facilities for different events
more than square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions
due to the buildings location and the beauty of the facilities being rented the rooms of casa batll were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city
the local name for the building is casa dels ossos as it has a visceral skeletal organic quality
the building looks very remarkable like everything gaud designed only identifiable as modernisme or art nouveau in the broadest sense
the ground floor in particular is rather astonishing with tracery irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work
it seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely
much of the faade is decorated with a mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues
the roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon or dinosaur
a common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre terminating at the top in a turret and cross represents the lance of saint george which has been plunged into the back of the dragon
the loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces
it was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas
it is known for its simplicity of shapes and its mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls
it contains a series of sixty catenary arches that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal
some people believe that the ribcage design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragons spine that is represented in the roof
the noble floor is larger than seven hundred square meters
it is the main floor of the building
the noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes
on the noble floor there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well
on the passeig de gracia side is mr batlls study a dining room and a secluded spot for courting couples decorated with a mushroom shaped fireplace
the elaborate and animal like dcor continues throughout the whole noble floor
in the house opened its doors to the public and people were allowed to visit the noble floor
the building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the international year of gaud
casa batll met with very much unanticipated success and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house
two years later in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on casa batll the fifth floor was restored and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well
in casa batll became a unesco world heritage site
the roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design
gaud represents an animals spine by using tiles of different colors on one side
the roof is decorated with four chimney stacks that are designed to prevent backdraughts
the faade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated
the lower ground floor with the main floor and two first floor galleries are contained in a structure of montjuc sandstone with undulating lines
the central part which reaches the last floor is a multicolored section with protruding balconies
the top of the building is a crown like a huge gable which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks
this room is currently empty
the top displays a trim with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations
the roofs arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye
legend has it that it was once possible to see the sagrada famlia through this window which was being built simultaneously
as of the partial view of the sagrada famlia is available from this vantage point with its spires visible over newer buildings
the tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster with the color grading from green on the right side where the head begins to deep blue and violet in the center to red and pink on the left side of the building
one of the highlights of the faade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions
it is a bulbous root like structure that evokes plant life
there is a second bulb shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering
the tower is decorated with monograms of jesus maria and joseph made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the faade
these symbols show the deep religiosity of gaud who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica to choose the theme of the holy family
the bulb was broken when it was delivered perhaps during transportation
although the manufacturer committed to re do the broken parts gaud liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring
the central part of the faade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies reminiscent of monets nymphas with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic
it is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with rounds of polychrome pottery
the discs were designed by gaud and jujol between tests during their stay in majorca while working on the restoration of the cathedral of palma
finally above the central part of the faade is a smaller balcony also iron with a different exterior aesthetic closer to a local type of lily
two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture
the faade of the main floor made entirely in sandstone and is supported by two columns
the design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass
in front of the large windows as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb with an apparent central articulation in fact this is a floral decoration
the rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth for which the casa batll has been nicknamed the house of yawns
the structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above
park gell is a privatized park system composed of gardens and architectural elements located on carmel hill in barcelona catalonia spain
carmel hill belongs to the mountain range of collserola the parc del carmel is located on the northern face
park gell is located in la salut a neighborhood in the grcia district of barcelona
with urbanization in mind eusebi gell assigned the design of the park to antoni gaud a renowned architect and the face of catalan modernism
the park was built from to and was officially opened as a public park in
in unesco declared the park a world heritage site under works of antoni gaud
park gell is the reflection of gauds artistic plenitude which belongs to his naturalist phase
during this period the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes
he put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry
to that the catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative ornamental creation
starting from a sort of baroquism his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises
in the design of park gell gaud unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the basilica and expiatory church of the holy family
gell and gaud conceived this park situated within a natural park
they imagined an organized grouping of high quality homes decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort finished off with an artistic touch
they also envisioned a community strongly influenced by symbolism since in the common elements of the park they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by both the patron and the architect therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political catalanism especially in the entrance stairway where the catalan countries are represented and from catholicism the monumento al calvario originally designed to be a chapel
the mythological elements are so important apparently gell and gauds conception of the park was also inspired by the temple of apollo of delphi
on the other hand many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex iconography that gaud applied to the urban project
such references go from political vindication to religious exaltation passing through mythology history and philosophy
specifically many studies claim to see references to freemasonry despite the deep religious beliefs of both gaud and count gell
these references have not been proven in the historiography of the modern architect
the multiplicity of symbols found in the park gell is as previously mentioned associated with political and religious signs with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and puzzles
the park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site the idea of count eusebi gell after whom the park was named
it was inspired by the english garden city movement the original english name park
the site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees called muntanya pelada
it already included a large country house called larrard house or muntaner de dalt house and was next to a neighbourhood of upper class houses called la salut
the intention was to exploit the fresh air and beautiful views from the site with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses
count eusebi gell added to the prestige of the development by moving in to live in larrard house
ultimately only two houses were built neither designed by gaud
one was intended to be a show house but on being completed in was put up for sale and as no buyers came forward gaud at gells suggestion bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in
this house where gaud lived from to was built by francesc berenguer in
it contains original works by gaud and several of his collaborators
it has been the gaud house museum since
in it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest
it has since been converted into a municipal garden
it can be reached by underground railway by city buses or by commercial tourist buses
since october there is an entrance fee to visit the monumental zone so the entrance to the park is no longer free
limited tickets are available that often sell out in advance
gauds house la torre rosa containing furniture that he designed can be only visited for another entrance fee
there is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both gauds house and the sagrada famlia church
park gell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park
the buildings flanking the entrance though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by gaud
these two buildings make up the porters lodge pavilion
one of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth
the other while once being the porters house is now a permanent exhibition of the barcelona city history museum muhba focused on the building itself the park and the city
the focal point of the park is the main terrace surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent
the curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves creating a more social atmosphere
gaud incorporated many motifs of catalan nationalism and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry into the park
much of the design of the benches was the work not of gaud but of his often overlooked collaborator josep maria jujol
roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by gaud as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures
this minimized the intrusion of the roads and gaud designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape
his structures echo natural forms with columns like tree trunks supporting branching vaulting under the roadway and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his church of colnia gell so that the inverted catenary arch shapes form perfect compression structures
at the parks high point there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses
the official name of this is el tur de les tres creus however many tourists choose to call it calvary
two of the crosses point north south and east west the third and tallest cross points skyward
this lookout offers the most complete view of barcelona and the bay
it is possible to view the main city in panorama with the sagrada famlia the agbar tower and the montjuc area visible at a distance
the park supports a wide variety of wildlife notably several of the non native species of parrot found in the barcelona area
other birds can be seen from the park with records including short toed eagle
the park also supports a population of hummingbird hawk moths
casa mil popularly known as la pedrera in reference to its unconventional rough hewn appearance is a modernista building in barcelona catalonia spain
it was the last private residence designed by architect antoni gaud and was built between and
the building was commissioned in by and his wife
at the time it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade twisting wrought iron balconies and design by josep maria jujol
several structural innovations include a self supporting stone faade and a free plan floor underground garage and the spectacular terrace on the roof
in it was declared a world heritage site by unesco
since it has been the headquarters of the fundaci catalunya la pedrera which manages visits to the building exhibitions and other cultural and educational activities at casa mil
antoni gaud i cornet was born on june in catalonia spain
as a child gauds health was poor suffering from rheumatism
because of this he was afforded lengthy periods of time resting at his summer house in riudoms
here he spent a large portion of his time outdoors allowing him to deeply study nature
this would become one of the major influences in his architecture to come
gaud was a very practical man and a craftsman at his core
in his work he followed impulses and turned creative plans into reality
his openness to embrace new styles combined with a vivid imagination helped mold new styles of architecture and consequently helped push the limits of construction
today he is regarded as a pioneer of the modern architecture style
in gaud moved to barcelona to study architecture
he was an inconsistent student who showed flashes of brilliance
it took him eight years to graduate due to a mix of health complications military service as well as other activities
after completion of his education he became a prolific architect as well as designing gardens sculptures and all other decorative arts
gauds most famous works consisted of several buildings parque gell palacio gell casa mila casa vicens
he also is contributed for his work on the crypt of la sagrada familia and the nativity facade
gauds work at the time was both admired and criticized for his bold innovative solutions
gaud was injured on june when he was run over by a tram
he later died in the hospital due to his injuries on june at the age of
a few years after his death his fame became renowned by critics and the general public alike
casa mil was built for roser segimn and her husband pere mil
roser segimn was the wealthy widow of josep guardiola an indiano or americano or former colonist returned from south america who had made his fortune with a coffee plantation in guatemala
her second husband pere mil was a developer known for his flamboyant lifestyle
in mil and segimn married and on june roser segimn bought a house with garden which occupied an area of square meters located on paseo de gracia
in september they commissioned gaud for building them a new house with the idea of living in the main floor and renting out the rest of the apartments
on february the project was presented to the barcelona city council and the works began demolishing the pre existing building instead of reforming it as in the case of the casa batll
the building was completed in december and the owner asked gaud to make a certificate to inhabit the main floor which the city council authorized in october and the couple moved in
on october gaud issued the certificate stating that in accordance with his plans and his direction the work had been completed and the whole house was ready to be rented
the building did not respect any rules of conventional style for which gaud received much criticism
to begin with the name la pedrera is in fact a nickname assigned by the citizens who disapproved of its unusualness
the unique structure of the building and the relationship between the buildings architect and pere mil became the object of ridicule for the people of barcelona and many humorous publications of the time
gaud a catholic and a devotee of the virgin mary planned for the casa mil to be a spiritual symbol
overt religious elements include an excerpt from the rosary on the cornice and planned statues of mary specifically our lady of the rosary and two archangels st
michael and st
however the casa mil was not built entirely to gauds specifications
the local government ordered the demolition of elements that exceeded the height standard for the city and fined the mils for many infractions of building codes
after semana trgica an outbreak of anticlericalism in the city mil prudently decided to forgo the religious statues
gaud contemplated abandoning the project but a priest persuaded him to continue
in mil died
segimon sold the property in for million pesetas to josep ballv i pellis known for his department stores on in partnership with the family of po rubert laporta
the compaa inmobiliaria provenza sa was founded to administer the building
roser segimon continued to live on the main floor until her death in
the new owners divided the first floor facing into five apartments instead of the original two
in they commissioned to convert rubbish filled attic laundry rooms to street facing apartments leaving a communal hallway on the side facing the courtyards
some of these two or three room apartments had a loft and were designed and furnished in a typical early s style using brick ceramic and wood
items of furniture such as the were reminiscent of eero saarinens work
the insurance company northern took over the main floor in
by then casa mil had housed a bingo hall an academy and the offices of cementos molins and inoxcrom among others
maintenance costs were high and the owners had allowed the building to become dilapidated causing stones to loosen in
josep anton comas made some emergency repairs especially to the paintings in the courtyards while respecting the original design
gauds work was designated a historic and artistic monument on july
casa mil was in poor condition in the early s
it had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate but it has been restored since and many of the original colors revived
in the building became part of a world heritage site encompassing some of gauds works
the barcelonan city council tried to rent the main floor as an office for the olympic bid
finally the day before christmas caixa catalunya bought la pedrera for million pesetas
on february urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the faade
the work was done by the architects joseph emilio hernndez cros and rafael vila
the renovated main floor opened in as part of the cultural olympiad of barcelona
the floor became an exhibition room with an example of modernism in the eixample
the building is m per floor on a plot of m
gaud made the first sketches in his workshop in the sagrada famlia
he designed the house as a constant curve both outside and inside incorporating ruled geometry and naturalistic elements
casa mil consists of two buildings which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine stories basement ground floor mezzanine main floor four upper floors and an attic
the basement was intended to be the garage the main floor the residence of the mils and the rest distributed over apartments
the resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards
the attic housed the laundry and drying areas forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof
one of the most notable elements of the building is the roof crowned with skylights staircase exits fans and chimneys
all of these elements constructed out of brick covered with lime broken marble or glass have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building
the apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs handcrafted wooden doors windows and furniture as well as hydraulic tiles and various ornamental elements
the stairways were intended as service entries with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor where gaud added a prominent interior staircase
gaud wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other
therefore there were only elevators on every other floor so people on different floors would meet one another
casa mil is characterized by its self supporting stone facade meaning that it is free of load bearing walls
the facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor
this construction system allows on one hand large openings in the facade which give light to the homes and on the other free structuring of the different levels so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building
this allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify without problems the interior layout of the homes
the facade is composed of large blocks of limestone from the garraf massif on the first floor and from the villefranche quarry for the higher levels
the blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them
the windows of la pedrera are an integral part of the overall facade design
gaud made sure that the windows were of varying sizes designed to optimize the amount of natural light that could enter the building
viewed from the outside the building has three parts the main body of the six storey blocks with winding stone floors two floors set a block back with a different curve similar to waves a smoother texture and whiter color and with small holes that look like embrasures and finally the body of the roof
gauds original facade had some of its lower level ironwork removed
in the tailor mosella opened the first store in la pedrera and he eliminated the bars
this did not concern anyone because in the middle of twentieth century wrought ironwork had little importance
the ironwork was lost until a few years later when americans donated one of them to the moma where it is on display
with restoration initiatives launched in the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen
in order to respect the fidelity of the original material was obtained from the villefranche quarry even though by then it was no longer operating
the building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark
its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building
there are two patios on the side of the passeig de gracia and of the street provence
patios structurally are key as supporting loads of interior facades
the floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of cast iron
in the courtyard there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but gaud applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams like the spokes of a bicycle
they form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below making the function of the central girder a keystone and working in tension and compression simultaneously
this supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered the soul of the building with a clear resemblance to gothic crypts
the centerpiece was built in a shipyard by josep maria carandell who copied a steering wheel interpreting gauds intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life
access is protected by a massive iron gate with a design attributed to jujol
it was originally used by both people and cars as access to the garage is in the basement now an auditorium
the two halls are fully polychrome with oil paintings on the plaster surfaces with eclectic references to mythology and flowers
during construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time
the future neighbor felix anthony meadows owner of industrial linera requested a change because his rolls royce could not access it
gaud agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that felix who was establishing sales and factory in parets del valls could go to both places with his car from la pedrera
for the floors of casa mil gaud used a model of floor forms of square timbers with two colors and the hydraulic pavement hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the batllo house
the wax was designed in gray by john bertrand under the supervision of gaud who touched up with their own fingers in the words of the manufacturer josep bay
like in casa batll gaud shows the application of the catenary arch as a support structure for the roof a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of matars cooperative known as lobrera mataronense
in this case gaud used the catalan technique of timbrel imported from italy in the fourteenth century
the attic where the laundry rooms were located was a clear room under a catalan vault roof supported by parabolic vaults of different heights and spaced by about cm
the roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm giving the roof deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys
the shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands
the builder bay explained its construction first the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered
then canaleta indicated the opening of each arch and bay put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall
from these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch
then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks
gaud wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones
the work of gaud on the rooftop of la pedrera brought his experience at palau gell together with solutions that were clearly more innovative this time creating shapes and volumes with more body more prominence and less polychromasia
on the rooftop there are six skylights staircase exits twenty eight chimneys in several groupings two half hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building and four domes that discharged to the facade
the staircases also house the water tanks some of which are snail shaped
the stepped roof of la pedrera called the garden of warriors by the poet pere gimferrer because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights has undergone a radical restoration removing chimneys added in interventions after gaud television antennas and other elements that degraded the space
the restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of marble and broken valencia tiles
one of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces it was said that gaud did that the day after the inauguration of the building taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party
it was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century
the repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from ulldecona with fragments of tiles
this whole set is more colorful than the facade although here the creamy tones are dominant
gaud as he had done in casa batll designed furniture specifically for the main floor
this was part of the concept artwork itself integral to modernism in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade as well as every detail of the decor designing furniture and accessories such as lamps planters floors or ceilings
this was another point of friction with segimon who complained that there was no straight wall to place her steinway piano
gauds response was blunt so play the violin
the result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of gaud as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when gaud died
some remain in private collections including a curtain made of oak m
long by m
high in the museum of catalan modernism and a chair and desktop of mil
gaud carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the casa y bardes but these were only included on two floors as when segimon discovered the price she decided there would be no more at that quality
casa mil is part of the unesco world heritage site works of antoni gaud
it was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar biomorphic appearance free exhibitions often are held on the first floor which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design
there is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof
the other floors are not open to visitors
gauds la pedrera was inspired by a mountain but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model
joan bergs thought it was the rocks of fray guerau in prades mountains
joan matamala thought that the model could have been st
miquel del fai while the sculptor vicente vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs torrent pareis in menorca
other options include the mountains of uhisar in cappadocia suggested by juan goytisolo or mola gallifa suggested by louis permanyer based on the fact that gaud visited the area in to escape an outbreak of cholera in barcelona
some people say that the interior layout of la pedrera comes from studies that gaud made of medieval fortresses
this image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as sentinels with great helmets
the structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry straight or repetitive pattern
rather it evokes bubbles of soap that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell
the buildings unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism
it was given the nickname la pedrera meaning the quarry
casa mil appeared in many satirical magazines
joan junceda presented it as a traditional easter cake by means of cartoons in patufet
joaquim garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine
homeowners in passeig de gracia became angry with mil and ceased to greet him arguing that the weird building by gaud would lower the price of land in the area
casa mil also caused some administrative problems
in december the city hall stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk not respecting the alignment of facades
again on august more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by
the council called for a fine of pesetas or for the demolition of the attic and roof
the dispute was resolved a year and a half later december when the commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a strict compliance with the bylaws
the owner entered la pedrera in the annual sponsored by the barcelona city council
other entries in the competition included two works by sagnier the by architect and the designed by
although the most dramatic and clear favorite was casa mil the jury opined that even though the facades were complete theres still a lot left to do before its fully completed finalized and in a perfect state of appreciation
the winner in was samanillo perez for his building which now houses the headquarters of the circulo ecuestre
gauds relations with segimon deteriorated during the construction and decoration of the house
there were many disagreements between them one example was the monumental bronze virgin del rosario which gaud wanted as the statue on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner that the artist carles mani i roig was to sculpt
the statue was not made although the words ave gratia m plena dominus tecum were written at the top of the facade
continuing disagreements led gaud to take mil to court over his fees
the lawsuit was won by gaud in and he gave the pesetas he won in the case to charity stating that the principles mattered more than money
mil was having to pay the mortgage
after gauds death in segimon got rid of most of the furniture that gaud had designed and covered over parts of gauds designs with new decorations in the style of louis xvi
la pedrera was acquired in by and when restoration was done four years later some of the original decorations re emerged
when the civil war broke out in july the mils were on vacation
part of the building was collectivized by the unified socialist party of catalonia the mils fled the area with some artwork
in particle physics every type of particle is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but with opposite physical charges
for example the antiparticle of the electron is the positron
while the electron has a negative electric charge the positron has a positive electric charge and is produced naturally in certain types of radioactive decay
the opposite is also true the antiparticle of the positron is the electron
some particles such as the photon are their own antiparticle
otherwise for each pair of antiparticle partners one is designated as the normal particle
the other is designated the antiparticle
particle antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other producing photons since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite total charge is conserved
for example the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons producing pairs of gamma rays a process exploited in positron emission tomography
the laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles
for example an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom which is believed to have the same properties as a hydrogen atom
this leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the big bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter rather than being a half and half mixture of matter and antimatter
the discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry originally thought to be perfect was only approximate
because charge is conserved it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge or by the simultaneous creation of both a particle and its antiparticle which can occur in particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider at cern
although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles
the neutron for example is made out of quarks the antineutron from antiquarks and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact
however other neutral particles are their own antiparticles such as photons z bosons pi meson mesons and hypothetical gravitons and some hypothetical wimps
in soon after the prediction of positrons by paul dirac carl d
anderson found that cosmic ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber a particle detector in which moving electrons leave behind trails as they move through the gas
the electric charge to mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud chamber track in a magnetic field
positrons because of the direction that their paths curled were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction
positron paths in a cloud chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge to mass ratio but with opposite charge and therefore opposite signed charge to mass ratios
the antiproton and antineutron were found by emilio segr and owen chamberlain in at the university of california berkeley
since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments
in recent years complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons collected in electromagnetic traps
solutions of the dirac equation contain negative energy quantum states
as a result an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state
even worse it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available
to prevent this unphysical situation from happening dirac proposed that a sea of negative energy electrons fills the universe already occupying all of the lower energy states so that due to the pauli exclusion principle no other electron could fall into them
sometimes however one of these negative energy particles could be lifted out of this dirac sea to become a positive energy particle
but when lifted out it would leave behind a hole in the sea that would act exactly like a positive energy electron with a reversed charge
these holes were interpreted as negative energy electrons by paul dirac and mistakenly identified with protons in his paper a theory of electrons and protons however these negative energy electrons turned out to be positrons and not protons
this picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe a problem of which dirac was aware
dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge
another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton
dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea until hermann weyl proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges
dirac also predicted a reaction where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons
robert oppenheimer and igor tamm however proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast
a year later in dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron a new particle of the same mass as the electron
the discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory
within diracs theory the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains
some bosons also have antiparticles but since bosons do not obey the pauli exclusion principle hole theory does not work for them
a unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in quantum field theory which solves both these problems by describing antimatter as negative energy states of the same underlying matter field ie particles moving backwards in time
if a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles
reactions such as are an example
the single photon annihilation of an electron positron pair cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together in this process
however in the coulomb field of a nucleus the translational invariance is broken and single photon annihilation may occur
the reverse reaction is also impossible for this reason
in quantum field theory this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the uncertainty principle
this opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may fluctuate into a two particle state and back
these processes are important in the vacuum state and renormalization of a quantum field theory
it also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here which is a complicated example of mass renormalization
quantum states of a particle and an antiparticle are interchanged by the combined application of charge conjugation formula parity formula and time reversal formula
formula and formula are linear unitary operators formula is antilinear and antiunitary formula
if formula denotes the quantum state of a particle formula with momentum formula and spin formula whose component in the z direction is formula then one has where formula denotes the charge conjugate state that is the antiparticle
in particular a massive particle and its antiparticle transform under the same irreducible representation of the poincar group which means the antiparticle has the same mass and the same spin
if formula formula and formula can be defined separately on the particles and antiparticles then where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side
as formula anticommutes with the charges formula particle and antiparticle have opposite electric charges q and q
one may try to quantize an electron field without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing where we use the symbol k to denote the quantum numbers p and of the previous section and the sign of the energy e and ak denotes the corresponding annihilation operators
of course since we are dealing with fermions we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti commutation relations
however if one now writes down the hamiltonian then one sees immediately that the expectation value of h need not be positive
this is because e can have any sign whatsoever and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value or
so one has to introduce the charge conjugate antiparticle field with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations where k has the same p and opposite and sign of the energy
then one can rewrite the field in the form where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy
the energy becomes where e is an infinite negative constant
the vacuum state is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle ie formula and formula
then the energy of the vacuum is exactly e
since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum h is positive definite
analysis of the properties of ak and bk shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles
this is the case of a fermion
this approach is due to vladimir fock wendell furry and robert oppenheimer
if one quantizes a real scalar field then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator therefore real scalar fields describe neutral bosons
since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators which are related by conjugation such fields describe charged bosons
by considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time ernst stueckelberg reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass m and spin j but opposite charges q
this allowed him to rewrite perturbation theory precisely in the form of diagrams
richard feynman later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism and they are now called feynman diagrams
each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time
in feynman diagrams anti particles are shown traveling backwards in time relative to normal matter and vice versa
this technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today
since this picture was first developed by stueckelberg and acquired its modern form in feynmans work it is called the feynman stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles to honor both scientists
kim renard nazel better known by his stage names arabian prince or professor x is an american rapper record producer and dj
he was a founding member of nwa nazel was born in compton california to the son of joseph skippy nazel jr an african american author and radio talk show host
his musical background came from his mother a piano teacher and classical musician
his family tried its best to shelter him sending him to a catholic school and keeping him busy with football to keep him away from the gangs
the younger nazel got his first experience with making music at the radio station his father hosted his talk show on nazel used the radio stations equipment to put together mixtapes that he would sell at school
nazel went on to graduate from junpero serra high school in nearby gardena
nazel took the stage name of dj prince and started selling mixtapes at school
while working at a luggage store at the del amo mall its owner sam nassif asked him to dj a party at a community center
he kept performing there for several weekends and the success persuaded nassif to invest even more in the place renaming it the cave where nazel would continue to host for over three years and even after his nwa days
nassif also funded dj princes first record strange life
he changed his stage name when he was years old at the skateland usa the same skating venue credited for launching nwa a few years later due to a fans suggestion
he said about his name arabian prince started working with bobby jimmy the critters in
he also produced the hit single and album for jj fad supersonic
in he was a founding member of nwa but soon after fellow member ice cube came back from the phoenix institute of technology in arabian prince left over royalty and contract disagreements
i started off as a solo artist he said so i was aware of what a royalty statement was
i knew that when these many records were sold there is a quarterly statement
when you look at it you can see how much money was paid and then share it
this was not the case
we were also never paid for touring
eazy e ice cube and mc ren remained as the main performers dj yella was the turntablist and dr dre was the main producer
after leaving nwa arabian prince began a solo career
his first album brother arab was released in with the single shes got a big posse wheres my bytches followed in
in the mid s he started releasing music again with his professor x project on the dutch label clone records
i could not release the record under arabian prince he said because i already had a single out so i called myself professor x on that record
in he performed as a dj on the k sports holiday bounce tour with artists from the stones throw label
in stones throw released a compilation of his electro rap material from the s
one of his songs was included on the video game college hoops k
in a biopic about nwa titled straight outta compton was released however arabian prince was not portrayed in the film
the following year nwa was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame but again arabian prince was not included nor mentioned
in arabian prince appeared on the amerikkkant album of industrial metal band ministry
he made a second appearance on ministrys album moral hygiene
aside from his music career he worked in special effects d animation and video games
after the release of the nwa film straight outta compton in arabian prince said to vladtv a lot of the scenes in real life i was there im just not there in the film which im like if youre gonna write me out of a movie shoot some other scenes
dont write scenes where i was there
some of the pivotal scenes would be choosing the name for the band the tour and the infamous detroit concert
he also remembers himself as the main opposer to jerry heller about the royalties and the money a role that in the film was instead given to ice cube
in mathematics the associative property is a property of some binary operations which means that rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result
in propositional logic associativity is a valid rule of replacement for expressions in logical proofs
within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator the order in which the operations are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the operands is not changed
that is rearranging the parentheses in such an expression will not change its value
consider the following equations formula even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line the values of the expressions were not altered
since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any real numbers it can be said that addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations
associativity is not the same as commutativity which addresses whether the order of two operands affects the result
for example the order does not matter in the multiplication of real numbers that is so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation
however operations such as function composition and matrix multiplication are associative but not commutative
associative operations are abundant in mathematics in fact many algebraic structures explicitly require their binary operations to be associative
however many important and interesting operations are non associative some examples include subtraction exponentiation and the vector cross product
in contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers the addition of floating point numbers in computer science is not associative and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error
here is used to replace the symbol of the operation which may be any symbol and even the absence of symbol as for multiplication
the associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus
if a binary operation is associative repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless of how valid pairs of parentheses are inserted in the expression
this is called the generalized associative law
for instance a product of four elements may be written without changing the order of the factors in five possible ways if the product operation is associative the generalized associative law says that all these expressions will yield the same result
so unless the expression with omitted parentheses already has a different meaning the parentheses can be considered unnecessary and the product can be written unambiguously as as the number of elements increases the number of possible ways to insert parentheses grows quickly but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation
an example where this does not work is the logical biconditional
it is associative thus is equivalent to but most commonly means which is not equivalent
some examples of associative operations include the following
in standard truth functional propositional logic association or associativity are two valid rules of replacement
the rules allow one to move parentheses in logical expressions in logical proofs
the rules are formula and formula where formula is a metalogical symbol representing can be replaced in a proof with
associativity is a property of some logical connectives of truth functional propositional logic
the following logical equivalences demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives
the following are truth functional tautologies
joint denial is an example of a truth functional connective that is not associative
a binary operation formula on a set s that does not satisfy the associative law is called non associative
symbolically formula for such an operation the order of evaluation does matter
for example also although addition is associative for finite sums it is not associative inside infinite sums
for example formula whereas formula some non associative operations are fundamental in mathematics
they appear often as the multiplication in structures called non associative algebras which have also an addition and a scalar multiplication
examples are the octonions and lie algebras
in lie algebras the multiplication satisfies jacobi identity instead of the associative law this allows abstracting the algebraic nature of infinitesimal transformations
other examples are quasigroup quasifield non associative ring and commutative non associative magmas
in mathematics addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative
by contrast in computer science the addition and multiplication of floating point numbers is not associative as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar sized values are joined together
even though most computers compute with or bits of mantissa this is an important source of rounding error and approaches such as the kahan summation algorithm are ways to minimise the errors
it can be especially problematic in parallel computing
in general parentheses must be used to indicate the order of evaluation if a non associative operation appears more than once in an expression
however mathematicians agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non associative operations
this is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses
a left associative operation is a non associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right ie formula formula both left associative and right associative operations occur
left associative operations include the following this notation can be motivated by the currying isomorphism which enables partial application
non associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following
william rowan hamilton seems to have coined the term associative property around a time when he was contemplating the non associative algebra of the octonions he had learned about from john t
the apache software foundation is an american nonprofit corporation organization in the united states to support a number of open source software projects
the asf was formed from a group of developers of the apache http server and incorporated on march
it includes approximately members
the apache software foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers
the software they produce is distributed under the terms of the apache license a permissive open source license for free and open source software
the apache projects are characterized by a collaborative consensus based development process and an open and pragmatic software license which is to say that it allows developers who receive the software freely to redistribute it under non free terms
each project is managed by a self selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project
the asf is a meritocracy implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to apache projects
the asf is considered a second generation open source organization in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock in
among the asfs objectives are to provide legal protection to volunteers working on apache projects and to prevent the apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission
the asf also holds several apachecon conferences each year highlighting apache projects and related technology
the history of the apache software foundation is linked to the apache http server development beginning in february
a group of eight developers started working on enhancing the ncsa httpd daemon
they came to be known as the apache group
on march the apache software foundation was formed
the first official meeting of the apache software foundation was held on april
the initial members of the apache software foundation consisted of the apache group brian behlendorf ken coar miguel gonzales mark cox lars eilebrecht ralf s
engelschall roy t
fielding dean gaudet ben hyde jim jagielski alexei kosut martin kraemer ben laurie doug maceachern aram mirzadeh sameer parekh cliff skolnick marc slemko william stoddard paul sutton randy terbush and dirk willem van gulik
after a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation the effective incorporation date of the apache software foundation was set to june
co founder brian behlendorf states how the name apache was chosen i suggested the name apache partly because the web technologies at the time that were launching were being called cyber this or spider that or something on those themes and i was like we need something a little more interesting a little more romantic not to be a cultural appropriator or anything like that i had just seen a documentary about geronimo and the last days of a native american tribe called the apaches right who succumbed to the invasion from the west from the united states and they were the last tribe to give up their territory and for me that almost romantically represented what i felt we were doing with this web server project
apache divides its software development activities into separate semi autonomous areas called top level projects some of which have a number of sub projects
unlike some other organizations that host foss projects before a project is hosted at apache it has to be licensed to the asf with a grant or contributor agreement
in this way the asf gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects
the board of directors of the apache software foundation is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the bylaws
this includes management of the corporate assets appointment of a president and corporate officers managing the core operations of the asf and allocation of corporate resources for the benefit of apache projects
technical decision making authority for every apache project is assigned to their independent project management committee the participants in each project provide direction not the board
the board is elected annually by the asf membership
the americans with disabilities act of or ada is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability
it affords similar protections against discrimination to americans with disabilities as the civil rights act of which made discrimination based on race religion sex national origin and other characteristics illegal and later sexual orientation and gender identity
in addition unlike the civil rights act the ada also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations
in the national council on disability had recommended the enactment of an americans with disabilities act and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the house and senate in
a broad bipartisan coalition of legislators supported the ada while the bill was opposed by business interests and conservative evangelicals
the final version of the bill was signed into law on july by president george h
it was later amended in and signed by president george w
bush with changes effective as of january
ada disabilities include both mental and physical medical conditions
a condition does not need to be severe or permanent to be a disability
equal employment opportunity commission regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities amputation attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism bipolar disorder blindness cancer cerebral palsy deafness diabetes epilepsy human immunodeficiency virus intellectual disability major depressive disorder mobility impairments multiple sclerosis muscular dystrophy obsessive compulsive disorder post traumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia
other mental or physical health conditions also may be disabilities depending on what the individuals symptoms would be in the absence of mitigating measures during an active episode of the condition
certain specific conditions that are widely considered anti social or tend to result in illegal activity such as kleptomania pedophilia exhibitionism voyeurism etc
are excluded under the definition of disability in order to prevent abuse of the statutes purpose
additionally sexual orientation is no longer considered a disorder and is also excluded under the definition of disability
however in the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit stated that the ada covers individuals with gender dysphoria which may aid transgender people in accessing legal protections they otherwise may be unable to
the ada states that a covered entity shall not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability
this applies to job application procedures hiring advancement and discharge of employees job training and other terms conditions and privileges of employment
covered entities include employers with or more employees as well as employment agencies labor organizations and joint labor management committees
there are strict limitations on when a covered entity can ask job applicants or employees disability related questions or require them to undergo medical examination and all medical information must be kept confidential
prohibited discrimination may include among other things firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability segregation and harassment based on a disability
covered entities are also required to provide reasonable accommodations to job applicants and employees with disabilities
a reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability and can include among other things special equipment that allows the person to perform the job scheduling changes and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated
an employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements
an employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use
there are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities including psychological ones
anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled
employers with more than employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed
even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well they are not necessarily no longer disabled employers must continue to follow all policies for disabled people
part of title i was found unconstitutional by the united states supreme court as it pertains to states in the case of board of trustees of the university of alabama v
garrett as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the eleventh amendment to the united states constitution
the court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ada rules
state employees can however file complaints at the department of justice or the equal employment opportunity commission who can sue on their behalf
title ii prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level eg school district municipal city or county and at state level
public entities must comply with title ii regulations by the us department of justice
these regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity
access includes physical access described in the ada standards for accessible design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity
title ii applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the us department of transportation
it includes the national railroad passenger corporation along with all other commuter authorities
this section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services
ada also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport
title ii also applies to all state and local public housing housing assistance and housing referrals
the office of fair housing and equal opportunity is charged with enforcing this provision
under title iii no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods services facilities or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns leases or operates a place of public accommodation
public accommodations include most places of lodging recreation transportation education and dining along with stores care providers and places of public displays
under title iii of the ada all new construction after the effective date of the ada must be fully compliant with the americans with disabilities act accessibility guidelines found in the code of federal regulations at cfr part appendix a
title iii also has applications to existing facilities
one of the definitions of discrimination under title iii of the ada is a failure to remove architectural barriers in existing facilities
this means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ada was passed still have obligations
the standard is whether removing barriers is readily achievable defined as
easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense
the statutory definition of readily achievable calls for a balancing test between the cost of the proposed fix and the wherewithal of the business and or owners of the business
thus what might be readily achievable for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business
there are exceptions to this title many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by title iii
with regard to historic properties those facilities must still comply with the provisions of title iii of the ada to the maximum extent feasible but if following the usual standards would threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building then alternative standards may be used
under revisions of department of justice regulations newly constructed or altered swimming pools wading pools and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people
however the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is readily achievable
other requirements exist based on pool size include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit which are outlined in section of the standards
however businesses are free to consider the differences in the application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule
full compliance may not be required for existing facilities section and of the standards outline such exceptions
the ada provides explicit coverage for service animals
guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises
businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special id of the animal
they cannot ask what the persons disabilities are
a person with a disability cannot be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen the animal is out of control and its owner cannot get it under control or the animal is a direct threat to peoples health and safety
allergies and fear of animals would not be considered a threat to peoples health and safety so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals
businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premises
in this case businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to relieve itself
lastly people that require service dogs cannot be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly for example being isolated from people at a restaurant
people with disabilities cannot be treated as less than other customers
however if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property the customer with a disability will be charged for their service animals damages to the property
the ada provides explicit coverage for auxiliary aids
auxiliary aids and services are items equipment or services that assist in effective communication between a person who has a hearing vision or speech disability and a person who does not
ada says that a public accommodation shall take those steps that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a disability is excluded denied services segregated or otherwise treated differently than other individuals because of the absence of auxiliary aids and services unless the public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods services facilities privileges advantages or accommodations being offered or would result in an undue burden ie significant difficulty or expense
the term auxiliary aids and services includes captions are considered one type of auxiliary aid
since the passage of the ada the use of captioning has expanded
entertainment educational informational and training materials are captioned for deaf and hard of hearing audiences at the time they are produced and distributed
the television decoder circuitry act of requires that all televisions larger than inches sold in the united states after july have a special built in decoder that enables viewers to watch closed captioned programming
the telecommunications act of directs the federal communications commission to adopt rules requiring closed captioning of most television programming
the fccs rules on closed captioning became effective january
title iv of the ada amended the landmark communications act of primarily by adding section
this section requires that all telecommunications companies in the us take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments
when title iv took effect in the early s it led to the installation of public teletypewriter machines and other tdd
title iv also led to the creation in all states and the district of columbia of what was then called dual party relay services and now are known as telecommunications relay services such as sts relay
today many trs mediated calls are made over the internet by consumers who use broadband connections
some are video relay service calls while others are text calls
in either variation communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others
in according to the federal communications commission vrs calls averaged two million minutes a month
title v includes technical provisions
it discusses for example the fact that nothing in the ada amends overrides or cancels anything in section
additionally title v includes an anti retaliation or coercion provision
the technical assistance manual for the ada explains this provision the ada has roots in section of the rehabilitation act of
in the national council on disability an independent federal agency issued a report towards independence in which the council examined incentives and disincentives in federal laws towards increasing the independence and full integration of people with disabilities into us society
among the disincentives to independence the council identified was the existence of large remaining gaps in civil rights coverage for people with disabilities in the united states
a principal conclusion of the report was to recommend the adoption of comprehensive civil rights legislation which became the ada
the idea of federal legislation enhancing and extending civil rights legislation to millions of americans with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late and early
in early both congress and the newly inaugurated bush white house worked separately then jointly to write legislation capable of expanding civil rights without imposing undue harm or costs on those already in compliance with existing rules and laws
over the years key activists and advocates played an important role in lobbying members of the us congress to develop and pass the ada including justin whitlock dart jr patrisha wright and others
ms wright is known as the general for her work in coordinating the campaign to enact the ada
she is widely considered the main force behind the campaign lobbying for the ada
senator bob dole was a supporter and advocate for the bill
about the importance of making employment opportunities inclusive shirley davis director of global diversity and inclusion at the society for human resource management said people with disabilities represent a critical talent pool that is underserved and underutilized
conservative evangelicals opposed the ada because the legislation protected individuals with hiv which they associated with homosexuality
the debate over the americans with disabilities act led some religious groups to take opposite positions
the association of christian schools international opposed the ada in its original form primarily because the ada labeled religious institutions public accommodations and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all
the cost argument advanced by acsi and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as public accommodations
church groups such as the national association of evangelicals testified against the adas title i employment provisions on grounds of religious liberty
the nae believed the regulation of the internal employment of churches was
an improper intrusion the federal government
many companies and corporations and business groups opposed the americans with disabilities act arguing that the legislation would impose costs on businesses
testifying before congress greyhound bus lines stated that the act had the potential to deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world
the us chamber of commerce argued that the costs of the ada would be enormous and have a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive
the national federation of independent businesses an organization that lobbies for small businesses called the ada a disaster for small business
pro business conservative commentators joined in opposition writing that the americans with disabilities act was an expensive headache to millions that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities
shortly before the act was passed disability rights activists with physical disabilities coalesced in front of the capitol building shed their crutches wheelchairs powerchairs and other assistive devices and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all of the capitols front steps without warning
as the activists did so many of them chanted ada now and vote now
some activists who remained at the bottom of the steps held signs and yelled words of encouragement at the capitol crawlers
jennifer keelan a second grader with cerebral palsy was videotaped as she pulled herself up the steps using mostly her hands and arms saying ill take all night if i have to
this direct action is reported to have inconvenienced several senators and to have pushed them to approve the act
while there are those who do not attribute much overall importance to this action the capitol crawl of is seen by some present day disability activists in the united states as a central act for encouraging the ada into law
senator tom harkin authored what became the final bill and was its chief sponsor in the senate
harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language saying it was so his deaf brother could understand
george h
bush on signing the measure on july said the ada defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities a history of having such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment
the equal employment opportunity commission was charged with interpreting the law with regard to discrimination in employment
the eeoc developed regulations limiting an individuals impairment to one that severely or significantly restricts a major life activity
the adaaa directed the eeoc to amend its regulations and replace severely or significantly with substantially limits a more lenient standard
on september president george w
bush signed the ada amendments act of into law
the amendment broadened the definition of disability thereby extending the adas protections to a greater number of people
the adaaa also added to the ada examples of major life activities including but not limited to caring for oneself performing manual tasks seeing hearing eating sleeping walking standing lifting bending speaking breathing learning reading concentrating thinking communicating and working as well as the operation of several specified major bodily functions
the act overturned a us supreme court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures
it also overturned the court restriction that an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability
in the united states house committee on education and labor stated that the amendment makes it absolutely clear that the ada is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability
thus the adaaa led to broader coverage of impaired employees
in october the supreme court declined to resolve a circuit split as to whether websites are covered by the ada
the court turned down an appeal from dominos pizza and let stand a us th circuit court of appeals ruling which held that the americans with disabilities act protects access not just to brick and mortar public accommodations but also to the websites and apps of those businesses
the ada led to significant improvements in terms of access to public services accessibility in the built environment and societal understanding of disability
between and the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by regardless of age educational level or type of disability with the most affected being young less educated and intellectually disabled men
while no causal link between the ada and that trend has been definitively identified some researchers have characterized the ada as ineffectual and argued that it caused this decline by raising the cost of doing business for employers who quietly avoid hiring people with disabilities for fear of lawsuit
to these employers hiring people with disabilities became too expensive as they had to spend extra on assistive technology
in for men of all working ages and women under current population survey data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers leading at least two economists to attribute the cause to the act
by contrast a study in found that while the act may have led to short term reactions by employers in the long term there were either positive or neutral consequences for wages and employment
in the rate of employment among disabled people increased to of the population of disabled people
since enforcement of the act began in july it has quickly become a major component of employment law
the ada allows private plaintiffs to receive only injunctive relief and attorneys fees and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non compliant businesses
unless a state law such as the california unruh civil rights act provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ada
the attorneys fees provision of title iii does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ada litigation but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain a financial reward from attorneys fees unless they act as their own attorney or as mentioned above a disabled plaintiff resides in a state that provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits
moreover there may be a benefit to these private attorneys general who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities
civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement
moreover the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the ada
courts have noted however in states that have enacted laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non compliant businesses professional plaintiffs are typically found
at least one of these plaintiffs in california has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission
through the end of fiscal year of the ada charges filed with and resolved by the equal employment opportunity commission were either dropped or investigated and dismissed by eeoc but not without imposing opportunity costs and legal fees on employers
there have been some notable cases regarding the ada
for example a major hotel room marketer with their business presence on the internet was sued because their customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms through their website without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform
such lawsuits represent a major potential expansion of the ada in that they seek to expand the adas authority to cyberspace where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply
green v
state of california no
s was a case in which the majority of the supreme court in california was faced with deciding whether the employee suing the state is required to prove they are able to perform essential job duties regardless of whether or not there was reasonable accommodation or if the employer must prove the person suing was unable to do so
the court ruled the burden was on the employee not the employer and reversed a disputed decision by the courts
plaintiff attorney david greenberg brought forth considerations of the concept that even in the state of california employers do not have to employ a worker who is unable to perform essential job functions with reasonable accommodation
forcing employers to do so would defy logic and establish a poor public policy in employment matters
national federation of the blind v
target corp
was a case where a major retailer target corp
was sued because their web designers failed to design its website to enable persons with low or no vision to use it
board of trustees of the university of alabama v
garrett was a united states supreme court case about congresss enforcement powers under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution
it decided that title i of the americans with disabilities act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed private citizens to sue states for money damages
barden v
the city of sacramento filed in march claimed that the city of sacramento failed to comply with the ada when while making public street improvements it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ada
certain issues were resolved in federal court
one issue whether sidewalks were covered by the ada was appealed to the th circuit court of appeals which ruled that sidewalks were a program under ada and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities
the ruling was later appealed to the us supreme court which refused to hear the case letting stand the ruling of the th circuit court
bates v
united parcel service inc was the first equal opportunity employment class action brought on behalf of deaf and hard of hearing workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination
it established legal precedence for d deaf hoh employees and customers to be fully covered under the ada
key findings included the outcome was that ups agreed to pay a million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country
spector v
norwegian cruise line ltd
was a case that was decided by the united states supreme court in
the defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ada
this argument was accepted by a federal court in florida and subsequently the fifth circuit court of appeals
however the us supreme court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that norwegian cruise lines was a business headquartered in the united states whose clients were predominantly americans and more importantly operated out of port facilities throughout the united states
olmstead v
lc was a case before the united states supreme court in
the two plaintiffs lois curtis and ew were institutionalized in georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia
clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution
the plaintiffs sued the state of georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the states community based treatment facilities
the supreme court decided under title ii of the ada that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ada and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it
perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life
the court added confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals including family relations social contacts work options economic independence educational advancement and cultural enrichment
therefore under title ii no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services programs or activities of any public entity
michigan paralyzed veterans of america v
the university of michigan was a case filed before the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan southern division
it was filed on behalf of the michigan paralyzed veterans of america against university of michigan michigan stadium claiming that michigan stadium violated the americans with disabilities act in its million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms concessions and parking
additionally the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue with nearly all the seats being provided in the end zone areas
the us department of justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney richard bernstein of the law offices of sam bernstein in farmington hills michigan which was settled in march
the settlement required the stadium to add wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by and an additional accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing wheelchair seats
this case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the doj the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules
the agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility
one of the first major ada lawsuits paralyzed veterans of america v
ellerbe becket architects and engineers was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase mci center in washington dc previous to this case which was filed only five years after the ada was passed the doj was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces
while section of adaag makes reference to lines of sight no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons
the mci center designed by ellerbe becket architects engineers was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing
this case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ada enforcement that continues to present day
toyota motor manufacturing kentucky inc
williams was a case in which the supreme court interpreted the meaning of the phrase substantially impairs as used in the americans with disabilities act
it reversed a sixth court of appeals decision to grant a partial summary judgment in favor of the respondent ella williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job related tasks as a disability
the court held that the major life activity definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living
the issue is not whether williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks
therefore the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely but rather to manual tasks in life in general
when the supreme court applied this standard it found that the court of appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability
the court of appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives and placed too much emphasis on her job disability
since the evidence showed that williams was performing normal daily tasks it ruled that the court of appeals erred when it found that williams was disabled
this ruling has since been invalidated by the adaaa
in fact congress explicitly cited toyota v
williams in the text of the adaaa itself as one of its driving influences for passing the adaaa
us airways inc
barnett was decided by the us supreme court in
this case held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face eg a transfer to a different position can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the companys seniority system
while the court held that in general a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable a plaintiff can present evidence that despite the seniority system the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand eg the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception would not make a difference
importantly the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail and that once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system it fell to barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable
in this case barnett was a us airways employee who injured his back rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo handling job
invoking seniority he transferred to a less demanding mailroom job but this position later became open to seniority based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees
barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less demanding mailroom job
us airways denied his request and he lost his job
the supreme court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgment in favor of us airways as well as the circuit courts approach that interpreted reasonable accommodation as effective accommodation
access now inc
southwest airlines co
was a case where the district court decided that the website of southwest airlines was not in violation of the americans with disabilities act because the ada is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace
judge patricia a
seitz found that the virtual ticket counter of the website was a virtual construct and hence not a public place of accommodation
as such to expand the ada to cover virtual spaces would be to create new rights without well defined standards
ouellette v
viacom international inc
held that a mere online presence does not subject a website to the ada guidelines
thus myspace and youtube were not liable for a dyslexic mans inability to navigate the site regardless of how impressive the online theater is
authors guild v
hathitrust was a case in which the district court decided that the hathitrust digital library was a transformative fair use of copyrighted works making a large number of written text available to those with print disability
zamora quezada v
healthtexas medical group was the first time this act was used against hmos when a novel lawsuit was filed by texas attorney robert provan against five hmos for their practice of revoking the contracts of doctors treating disabled patients
in these hmos sought to dismiss provans lawsuit but a federal court ruled against them and the case was settled out of court
many decisions relating to provans unique lawsuit against these hmos have been cited in other court cases since
campbell v
general dynamics government systems corp
concerned the enforceability of a mandatory arbitration agreement contained in a dispute resolution policy linked to an e mailed company wide announcement insofar as it applies to employment discrimination claims brought under the americans with disabilities act
tennessee v
lane us was a case in the supreme court of the united states involving congresss enforcement powers under section of the fourteenth amendment
george lane was unable to walk after a car accident in which he was accused of driving on the wrong side of the road
a woman was killed in the crash and lane faced misdemeanor charges of reckless driving
the suit was brought about because he was denied access to appear in criminal court because the courthouse had no elevator even though the court was willing to carry him up the stairs and then willing to move the hearing to the first floor
he refused citing he wanted to be treated as any other citizen and was subsequently charged with failure to appear after appearing at a previous hearing where he dragged himself up the stairs
the court ruled that congress did have enough evidence that disabled people were being denied those fundamental rights that are protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and had the enforcement powers under section of the fourteenth amendment
it further ruled that reasonable accommodations mandated by the ada were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm
in the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit stated that the ada covers individuals with gender dysphoria which may aid transgender people in accessing legal protections they otherwise may be unable to
the apple computer originally released as the apple computer and known later as the apple i or apple is an bit desktop computer released by the apple computer company in
it was designed by steve wozniak
the idea of selling the computer came from wozniaks friend and apple co founder steve jobs
the apple i was apples first product and to finance its creation wozniak sold his hp calculator for and jobs sold a second hand vw microbus for a few hundred dollars
wozniak demonstrated the first prototype in july at the homebrew computer club in palo alto california
production was discontinued on september after the june introduction of its successor the apple ii which byte magazine referred to as part of the trinity of personal computing
on march steve wozniak attended the first meeting of the homebrew computer club in gordon frenchs garage
he was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would eventually become the apple i computer
after building it for himself and showing it at the club he and steve jobs gave out schematics for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies
then steve jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board just the bare board with no electronic parts that people could use to build the computers
wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost and manufacturing would cost another per board he hoped to recoup his costs if people bought the boards for each
to fund this small venture their first company jobs sold his van and wozniak sold his hp calculator
very soon after steve jobs arranged to sell something like completely built computers to the byte shop at each
to fulfill the order they obtained in parts at days net and delivered the finished product in days
the apple i went on sale in july at a price of because wozniak liked repeating digits and because of a one third markup on the wholesale price
jobs had managed to get the inventory into the nations first four storefront microcomputer retailers byte shop itty bitty machine company data domain and computer mart
the first unit produced was used in a high school math class and donated to liza loops public access computer center
about units were produced and all but were sold within nine or ten months
in april the price was dropped to
it continued to be sold through august despite the introduction of the apple ii in april which began shipping in june of that year
in october the apple i was officially discontinued and removed from apples price list
as wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer the company offered apple i owners discounts and trade ins for apple iis to persuade them to return their computers
these recovered boards were then destroyed by apple contributing to their later rarity
wozniaks design originally used a motorola processor which cost but when mos technology introduced the much cheaper microprocessor he switched
the apple i cpu ran at a fraction of the ntsc color carrier which simplified video circuitry
memory used the new kbit dram chips and was expandable to on board or externally
the board was designed to use the next generation of kbit memory chips when they became available
an optional plug in cassette interface card allowed users to store programs on ordinary audio cassette tapes
a basic interpreter originally written by wozniak was provided that let users easily write programs and play simple games
an onboard ac power supply was included
the apple is built in computer terminal circuitry with tv composite output used shift registers and a character generator
all one needed was a television set and a ascii keyboard
the apple did not come with a case
it was either used as is or some chose to build custom cases
competing machines such as the altair generally were programmed with front mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights for output and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a teletypewriter machine
this made the apple i along with earlier introduced sphere and other hobbyist microcomputers an innovative machine for its day
apple i computers have been confirmed to exist and according to unverified information more are likely to exist
from these were produced in the first batch in the second batch and unknown versions potentially from other batches also exist
most are now in working condition
both steve jobs and steve wozniak have stated that apple did not assign serial numbers to the apple l
several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them which appear to be inspection stickers from the pcb manufacturer assembler
a batch of boards is known to have numbers hand written in black permanent marker on the back these usually appear as
as of january apple s with a serial number are known
the highest known number is
two original apple s have been analyzed by psa los angeles concluding the serial numbers had been hand written by steve jobs
several apple i clones and replicas have been released in recent years
these are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist collector community
availability is usually limited to small runs in response to demand
apatosaurus is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived in north america during the late jurassic period
othniel charles marsh described and named the first known species a
ajax in and a second species a
louisae was discovered and named by william h
holland in
apatosaurus lived about to million years ago during the late kimmeridgian to early tithonian age and are now known from fossils in the morrison formation of modern day colorado oklahoma new mexico wyoming and utah in the united states
apatosaurus had an average length of and an average mass of
a few specimens indicate a maximum length of greater than average and a mass of approximately
the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of diplodocus a diplodocid like apatosaurus and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer implying that apatosaurus was a more robust animal
the tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion
apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb
the apatosaurus skull long thought to be similar to camarasaurus is much more similar to that of diplodocus
apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated
to lighten its vertebrae apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes
like that of other diplodocids its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises or as more recently suggested as a sensory organ
the skull of apatosaurus was confused with that of camarasaurus and brachiosaurus until when the holotype of a
louisae was found and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck
henry fairfield osborn disagreed with this association and went on to mount a skeleton of apatosaurus with a camarasaurus skull cast
apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts until when mcintosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to diplodocus were more likely from apatosaurus
apatosaurus is a genus in the family diplodocidae
it is one of the more basal genera with only amphicoelias and possibly a new unnamed genus more primitive
although the subfamily apatosaurinae was named in the group was not used validly until an extensive study
only brontosaurus is also in the subfamily with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines
brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of apatosaurus its type species was reclassified as aexcelsus in
a study concluded that brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from apatosaurus but not all paleontologists agree with this division
as it existed in north america during the late jurassic apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as allosaurus camarasaurus diplodocus and stegosaurus
apatosaurus was a large long necked quadrupedal animal with a long whip like tail
its forelimbs were slightly shorter than its hindlimbs
most size estimates are based on specimen cm the type specimen of alouisae reaching in length and in body mass
a study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of dreadnoughtus apatosaurus and giraffatitan estimates cm at similar in mass to dreadnoughtus
some specimens of aajax represent individuals longer suggesting masses twice that of cm or potentially rivaling the largest titanosaurs
however the upper size estimate of omnh is likely an exaggeration with the size estimates revised in at in length and in body mass based on volumetric analysis
the skull is small in relation to the size of the animal
the jaws are lined with spatulate teeth suited to an herbivorous diet
the snout of apatosaurus and similar diplodocoids is squared with only nigersaurus having a squarer skull
the braincase of apatosaurus is well preserved in specimen byu which also preserved much of the skeleton
a phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids
some skulls of apatosaurus have been found still in articulation with their teeth
those teeth that have the enamel surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface instead they display a sugary texture and little wear
like those of other sauropods the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle resulting in a wide deep neck
the vertebral formula for the holotype of alouisae is cervicals dorsals sacrals and caudals
the caudal vertebra number may vary even within species
the cervical vertebrae of apatosaurus and brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than those of other diplodocids and were found to be most similar to camarasaurus by charles whitney gilmore
in addition they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck making the neck nearly triangular in cross section
in apatosaurus louisae the atlas axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused
the dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated
apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body
the large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight saving air sacs
apatosaurus like its close relative supersaurus has tall neural spines which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae
the shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips
apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids giving it an unusually deep chest
as in other diplodocids the tail transformed into a whip like structure towards the end
the limb bones are also very robust
within apatosaurinae the scapula of apatosaurus louisae is intermediate in morphology between those of aajax and brontosaurus excelsus
the arm bones are stout so the humerus of apatosaurus resembles that of camarasaurus as well as brontosaurus
however the humeri of brontosaurus and aajax are more similar to each other than they are to alouisae
in charles gilmore noted that previous reconstructions of apatosaurus forelimbs erroneously proposed that the radius and ulna could cross in life they would have remained parallel
apatosaurus had a single large claw on each forelimb a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than shunosaurus
the first three toes had claws on each hindlimb
the phalangeal formula is meaning the innermost finger on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one
the single manual claw bone is slightly curved and squarely truncated on the anterior end
the pelvic girdle includes the robust ilia and the fused pubes and ischia
the femora of apatosaurus are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of sauropoda
the tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of diplodocus but are nearly indistinguishable from those of camarasaurus
the fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia
the foot of apatosaurus has three claws on the innermost digits the digit formula is
the first metatarsal is the stoutest a feature shared among diplodocids
the first apatosaurus fossils were discovered by arthur lakes a local miner and his friend henry c
beckwith in the spring of in morrison a town in the eastern foothills of the rocky mountains in jefferson county colorado
arthur lakes wrote to othniel charles marsh professor of paleontology at yale university and edward drinker cope paleontologist based in philadelphia about the discovery until eventually collecting several fossils and sending them to both paleontologists
marsh named atlantosaurus montanus based on some of the fossils sent and hired lakes to collect the rest of the material at morrison and send it to yale while cope attempted to hire lakes as well but was rejected
one of the best specimens collected by lakes in was a well preserved partial postcranial skeleton including many vertebrae and a partial braincase which was sent to marsh and named apatosaurus ajax in november
the composite term apatosaurus comes from the greek words meaning deception deceptive and meaning lizard thus deceptive lizard
marsh gave it this name based on the chevron bones which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs instead the chevron bones of apatosaurus showed similarities with those of mosasaurs most likely that of the representative species mosasaurus
by the end of excavations at lakes quarry in morrison several partial specimens of apatosaurus had been collected but only the type specimen of a
ajax can be confidently referred to the species
during excavation and transportation the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another apatosaurine individual originally described as atlantosaurus immanis as a consequence some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence
marsh distinguished the new genus apatosaurus from atlantosaurus on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae with apatosaurus possessing three and atlantosaurus four
recent research shows that traits usually used to distinguish taxa at this time were actually widespread across several taxa causing many of the taxa named to be invalid like atlantosaurus
two years later marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen from como bluff wyoming he gave this specimen the name brontosaurus excelsus
also at como bluff the hubbell brothers working for edward drinker cope collected a tibia fibula scapula and several caudal vertebrae along with other fragments belonging to apatosaurus in at copes quarry at the site
later in othniel marsh named diplodocus lacustris based on a chimeric partial dentary snout and several teeth collected by lakes in at morrison
in it was suggested that the dentary of d
lacustris and its teeth were actually from apatosaurus ajax based on its proximity to the type braincase of a
all specimens currently considered apatosaurus were from the morrison formation the location of the excavations of marsh and cope
after the end of the bone wars many major institutions in the eastern united states were inspired by the depictions and finds by marsh and cope to assemble their own dinosaur fossil collections
the competition to mount the first sauropod skeleton specifically was the most intense with the american museum of natural history carnegie museum of natural history and field museum of natural history all sending expeditions to the west to find the most complete sauropod specimen bring it back to the home institution and mount it in their fossil halls
the american museum of natural history was the first to launch an expedition finding a well preserved skeleton which is occasionally assigned to apatosaurus is considered nearly complete only the head feet and sections of the tail are missing and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted
the specimen was found north of medicine bow wyoming in by walter granger and took the entire summer to extract
to complete the mount sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added
in addition a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made
this was not a delicate skull like that of diplodocuswhich was later found to be more accuratebut was based on the biggest thickest strongest skull bones lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries
these skulls were likely those of camarasaurus the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time
the mount construction was overseen by adam hermann who failed to find apatosaurus skulls
hermann was forced to sculpt a stand in skull by hand
osborn said in a publication that the skull was largely conjectural and based on that of morosaurus
in elmer riggs published a study that described a well preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the grand river valley near fruita colorado field museum of natural history specimen p
riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the como bluff in wyoming from which marsh had described brontosaurus
most of the skeleton was found and after comparison with both brontosaurus and apatosaurus ajax riggs realized that the holotype of aajax was immature and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid
since apatosaurus was the earlier name brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of apatosaurus
because of this riggs recombined brontosaurus excelsus as apatosaurus excelsus
based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to apatosaurus riggs also determined that the field columbian museum specimen was likely most similar to aexcelsus
despite riggs publication henry fairfield osborn who was a strong opponent of marsh and his taxa labeled the apatosaurus mount of the american museum of natural history brontosaurus
because of this decision the name brontosaurus was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what riggs considered apatosaurus and the museums popularity meant that brontosaurus became one of the best known dinosaurs even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the th and early st centuries
it was not until that an apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition led by earl douglass to what would become known as the carnegie quarry at dinosaur national monument
the skull was found a short distance from a skeleton identified as the new species apatosaurus louisae named after louise carnegie wife of andrew carnegie who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the american west
the skull was designated cm it was very similar to the skull of diplodocus
another smaller skeleton of alouisae was found nearby cm and cm
the skull was accepted as belonging to the apatosaurus specimen by douglass and carnegie museum director william h
holland although other scientistsmost notably osbornrejected this identification
holland defended his view in in an address to the paleontological society of america yet he left the carnegie museum mount headless
while some thought holland was attempting to avoid conflict with osborn others suspected holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton
after hollands death in museum staff placed a cast of a camarasaurus skull on the mount
while most other museums were using cast or sculpted camarasaurus skulls on apatosaurus mounts the yale peabody museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a camarasaurus with the cranium based on marshs illustration of the skull
the skull also included forward pointing nasalssomething unusual for any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls
no apatosaurus skull was mentioned in literature until the s when john stanton mcintosh and david berman redescribed the skulls of diplodocus and apatosaurus
they found that though he never published his opinion holland was almost certainly correct that apatosaurus had a diplodocus like skull
according to them many skulls long thought to pertain to diplodocus might instead be those of apatosaurus
they reassigned multiple skulls to apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae
even though they supported holland it was noted that apatosaurus might have possessed a camarasaurus like skull based on a disarticulated camarasaurus like tooth found at the precise site where an apatosaurus specimen was found years before
on october after the publications by mcintosh and berman the first true skull of apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum that of the carnegie
in it was suggested that the felch quarry skull that marsh had included in his skeletal restoration instead belonged to brachiosaurus
in the first specimen of apatosaurus where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described
this specimen cmcvp was found to differ in both skull and neck features from alouisae but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with aajax
another well preserved skull is brigham young university specimen a well preserved skull and skeleton with a preserved braincase
the specimen was found in cactus park quarry in western colorado
in matthew mossbrucker and several other authors published an abstract that described a premaxilla and maxilla from lakes original quarry in morrison and referred the material to apatosaurus ajax
almost all modern paleontologists agreed with riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus
according to the rules of the iczn the name apatosaurus having been published first has priority as the official name brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore long discarded from formal use
despite this at least one paleontologistrobert t
bakkerargued in the s that aajax and aexcelsus were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus
in emanuel tschopp octvio mateus and roger benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters and species separated based on six
the minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that aajax and alouisae differ in twelve characters and diplodocus carnegiei and dhallorum differ in eleven characters
thus thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera
the six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species with only one differing character in dcarnegiei and alouisae but five differing features in bexcelsus
therefore tschopp etal
argued that apatosaurus excelsus originally classified as brontosaurus excelsus had enough morphological differences from other species of apatosaurus that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again
the conclusion was based on a comparison of morphological characteristics across different dinosaur individuals
among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of apatosaurus species compared to bexcelsus
other species previously assigned to apatosaurus such as elosaurus parvus and eobrontosaurus yahnahpin were also reclassified as brontosaurus
some features proposed to separate brontosaurus from apatosaurus include posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide the scapula rear to the acromial edge and the distal blade being excavated the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the astragalus or greater
sauropod expert michael demic pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name brontosaurus again if newer analyses obtained different results
mammal paleontologist donald prothero criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature concluding that he would keep brontosaurus in quotes and not treat the name as a valid genus
many species of apatosaurus have been designated from scant material
marsh named as many species as he could which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains
in paul upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of apatosaurus
they found that alouisae was the most basal species followed by fmnhp and then a polytomy of aajax aparvus and aexcelsus
their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in which resolved the relationships of apatosaurus slightly differently and also supported separating brontosaurus from apatosaurus
the cladogram below is the result of an analysis by tschopp mateus and benson
the authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus
apatosaurus is a member of the family diplodocidae a clade of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs
the family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth including diplodocus supersaurus and barosaurus
apatosaurus is sometimes classified in the subfamily apatosaurinae which may also include suuwassea supersaurus and brontosaurus
othniel charles marsh described apatosaurus as allied to atlantosaurus within the now defunct group atlantosauridae
in marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder including apatosaurus atlantosaurus morosaurus and diplodocus
he classified this group within sauropoda a group he erected in the same study
in elmer s
riggs said the name sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names he grouped apatosaurus within opisthocoelia
sauropoda is still used as the group name
in john whitlock published a study that placed apatosaurus a more basal diplodocid sometimes less basal than supersaurus
cladogram of the diplodocidae after tschopp mateus and benson
it was believed throughout the th and early th centuries that sauropods like apatosaurus were too massive to support their own weight on dry land
it was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water perhaps in swamps
more recent findings do not support this sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals
a study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout large proportion of pits and fine subparallel scratches of the teeth of apatosaurus suggests it was a ground height nonselective browser
it may have eaten ferns cycadeoids seed ferns horsetails and algae
stevens and parish speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants
a study of the necks of apatosaurus and brontosaurus found many differences between them and other diplodocids and that these variations may have shown that the necks of apatosaurus and brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat
various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed
one suggestion is that they were used for defense but their shape and size make this unlikely
it was also possible they were for feeding but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing
trackways of sauropods like apatosaurus show that they may have had a range of around per day and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of per hour
the slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling or to recoil after strides
a trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism though this is disputed
diplodocids like apatosaurus are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air allowing them to browse on tall trees
some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upward and that sauropods like apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding
other studies by taylor find that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal alert posture they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals
apatosaurus like diplodocus would have held its neck angled upward with the head pointing downward in a resting posture
kent stevens and michael parrish state apatosaurus had a great feeding range its neck could bend into a u shape laterally
the necks range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet
matthew cobley et al
dispute this finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck
they state the feeding ranges for sauropods like diplodocus were smaller than previously believed and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation
as such they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs
the conclusions of cobley etal
are disputed by taylor who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of apatosaurus and diplodocus
he found that the neck of apatosaurus was very flexible
given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like apatosaurus physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed
beginning with the assumption that like crocodilians apatosaurus did not have a diaphragm the dead space volume has been estimated at about for a specimen
paladino calculates its tidal volume at with an avian respiratory system if mammalian and if reptilian
on this basis its respiratory system would likely have been parabronchi with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in avian lungs and a flow through lung
an avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of which would exceed the space available
the overall thoracic volume of apatosaurus has been estimated at allowing for a four chambered heart and a lung capacity
that would allow about for the necessary tissue
evidence for the avian system in apatosaurus and other sauropods is also present in the pneumaticity of the vertebrae
though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal wedel states they are also likely connected to air sacs as in birds
james spotila et al
concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat
they assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system
wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat
some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain
others suggest that the near horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated
james farlow calculates that an apatosaurus sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents
assuming apatosaurus had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting metabolism frank paladino etal
estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day
a microscopic study of apatosaurus and brontosaurus bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near adult sizes in about years
in a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by thomas lehman and holly woodward
they said that by using growth lines and length to mass ratios apatosaurus would have grown to t in years with growth peaking at in a single year
an alternative method using limb length and body mass found apatosaurus grew per year and reached its full mass before it was about years old
these estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling
one of the first identified growth factors of apatosaurus was the number of sacral vertebrae which increased to five by the time of the creatures maturity
this was first noted in and again in
long bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached
a study by eva griebeler etal
examined long bone histological data and concluded the apatosaurus spsma weighed reached sexual maturity at years and died aged
the same growth model indicated apatosaurus spbyu weighed reached sexual maturity at years and died aged
compared with most sauropods a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from apatosaurus
multiple specimens in the omnh are from juveniles of an undetermined species of apatosaurus this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles some vertebrae and limb bones
omnh juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals
the specimens exhibit features that distinguish apatosaurus from its relatives and thus likely belong to the genus
juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails and a more pronounced forelimb hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods
an article published in reported research of the mechanics of apatosaurus tails by nathan myhrvold and paleontologist philip j
myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail which in diplodocids like apatosaurus was a very long tapering structure resembling a bullwhip
this computer modeling suggested diplodocids were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over decibels comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired
a pathology has been identified on the tail of apatosaurus caused by a growth defect
two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone including the arches of the neural spines
this defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints
it has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat and defense but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself
more recently baron considers the use of the tail as a bullwhip unlikely because of the potentially catastrophic muscle and skeletal damage such speeds could cause on the large and heavy tail
instead he proposes that the tails might have been used as a tactile organ to keep in touch with the individuals behind and on the sides in a group while migrating which could have augmented cohesion and allowed communication among individuals while limiting more energetically demanding activities like stopping to search for dispersed individuals turning to visually check on individuals behind or communicating vocally
the morrison formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which according to radiometric dating dates from between mya at its base and mya at the top placing it in the late oxfordian kimmeridgian and early tithonian stages of the late jurassic period
this formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons
the morrison basin where dinosaurs lived stretched from new mexico to alberta and saskatchewan it was formed when the precursors to the front range of the rocky mountains started pushing up to the west
the deposits from their east facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands lakes river channels and floodplains
this formation is similar in age to the lourinh formation in portugal and the tendaguru formation in tanzania
apatosaurus was the second most common sauropod in the morrison formation ecosystem after camarasaurus
apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other morrison formation dinosaurs
fossils of the genus have only been found in the upper levels of the formation
those of apatosaurus ajax are known exclusively from the upper brushy basin member about mya
alouisae fossils are rare known only from one site in the upper brushy basin member they date to the late kimmeridgian stage about mya
additional apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks but they have not been identified as any particular species and thus may instead belong to brontosaurus
the morrison formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs
dinosaurs known from the morrison formation include the theropods allosaurus ceratosaurus ornitholestes saurophaganax and torvosaurus the sauropods brontosaurus brachiosaurus camarasaurus and diplodocus and the ornithischians camptosaurus dryosaurus and stegosaurus
apatosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as allosaurus camarasaurus diplodocus and stegosaurus
allosaurus accounted for of theropod specimens and was at the top trophic level of the morrison food web
many of the dinosaurs of the morrison formation are of the same genera as those seen in portuguese rocks of the lourinh formationmainly allosaurus ceratosaurus and torvosaurusor have a close counterpartbrachiosaurus and lusotitan camptosaurus and draconyx and apatosaurus and dinheirosaurus
other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo environment include ray finned fishes frogs salamanders turtles sphenodonts lizards terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs and several species of pterosaur
shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common
the flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae fungi mosses horsetails cycads ginkgoes and several families of conifers
vegetation varied from river lining forests of tree ferns with fern understory to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the araucaria like conifer brachyphyllum
allosaurus is an extinct genus of large carnosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived to million years ago during the late jurassic period
the name allosaurus means different lizard alluding to its unique concave vertebrae
it is derived from the greek words and
the first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in by famed paleontologist othniel charles marsh
as one of the first well known theropod dinosaurs it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles
allosaurus was a large bipedal predator for its time
its skull was light robust and equipped with dozens of sharp serrated teeth
it averaged in length for a
fragilis with the largest specimens estimated as being long
relative to the large and powerful legs its three fingered hands were small and the body was balanced by a long muscular tail
it is classified as an allosaurid a type of carnosaurian theropod dinosaur
the genus has a very complicated taxonomy and includes at least three valid species the best known of which is a
the bulk of allosaurus remains have come from north americas morrison formation with material also known from portugal
it was known for over half of the th century as antrodemus but a study of the abundant remains from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry returned the name allosaurus to prominence and established it as one of the best known dinosaurs
as the most abundant large predator of the morrison formation allosaurus was at the top of the food chain and probably preyed on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs with the possibility of hunting other predators
potential prey included ornithopods stegosaurids and sauropods
some paleontologists interpret allosaurus as having had cooperative social behavior and hunting in packs while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses
the discovery and early study of allosaurus is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the bone wars of the late th century
the first described fossil in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by ferdinand vandeveer hayden in
it came from middle park near granby colorado probably from morrison formation rocks
the locals had identified such bones as petrified horse hoofs
hayden sent his specimen to joseph leidy who identified it as half of a tail vertebra and tentatively assigned it to the european dinosaur genus poekilopleuron as poicilopleuron valens
he later decided it deserved its own genus antrodemus
allosaurus itself is based on ypm a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae a rib fragment a tooth a toe bone and the shaft of the right humerus
othniel charles marsh gave these remains the formal name allosaurus fragilis in
allosaurus comes from the greek words meaning strange or different and meaning lizard or reptile
it was named different lizard because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery
the species epithet fragilis is latin for fragile referring to lightening features in the vertebrae
the bones were collected from the morrison formation of garden park north of caon city
marsh and edward drinker cope who were in scientific competition with each other went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of allosaurus
these include marshs creosaurus and labrosaurus as well as copes epanterias
in their haste cope and marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries
for example after the discovery by benjamin mudge of the type specimen of allosaurus in colorado marsh elected to concentrate work in wyoming
when work resumed at garden park in m
felch found an almost complete allosaurus and several partial skeletons
in addition one of copes collectors h
hubbell found a specimen in the como bluff area of wyoming in but apparently did not mention its completeness and cope never unpacked it
upon unpacking it in it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known and the skeleton now cataloged as amnh was put on public view in
this is the well known mount poised over a partial apatosaurus skeleton as if scavenging it illustrated as such in a painting by charles r
although notable as the first free standing mount of a theropod dinosaur and often illustrated and photographed it has never been scientifically described
the multiplicity of early names complicated later research with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by marsh and cope
even at the time authors such as samuel wendell williston suggested that too many names had been coined
for example williston pointed out in that marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish allosaurus from creosaurus
the most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by charles w
gilmore in
he came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named antrodemus by leidy was indistinguishable from those of allosaurus and that antrodemus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority
antrodemus became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over years until james henry madsen published on the cleveland lloyd specimens and concluded that allosaurus should be used because antrodemus was based on material with poor if any diagnostic features and locality information
for example the geological formation that the single bone of antrodemus came from is unknown
antrodemus has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by madsen
although sporadic work at what became known as the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in emery county utah had taken place as early as and the fossil site itself described by william l
stokes in major operations did not begin there until
under a cooperative effort involving nearly institutions thousands of bones were recovered between and led by james henry madsen
the quarry is notable for the predominance of allosaurus remains the condition of the specimens and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be
the majority of bones belong to the large theropod allosaurus fragilis and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well mixed
nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed
suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog becoming trapped in deep mud falling victim to drought induced mortality around a waterhole and getting trapped in a spring fed pond or seep
regardless of the actual cause the great quantity of well preserved allosaurus remains has allowed this genus to be known in great detail making it among the best known of all theropods
skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes from less than to long and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused
due to being one of utahs two fossil quarries where numerous allosaurus specimens have been discovered allosaurus was designated as the state fossil of utah in
the period since madsens monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning allosaurus in life
such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation growth skull construction hunting methods the brain and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care
reanalysis of old material new discoveries in portugal and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base
in big al a complete partially articulated specimen of allosaurus was discovered measuring about meters long
mor was excavated near shell wyoming by a joint museum of the rockies and university of wyoming geological museum team
this skeleton was discovered by a swiss team led by kirby siber
chure and loewen in identified the individual as a representative of the species allosaurus jimmadseni
in the same team discovered a second allosaurus big al ii
this specimen the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date is also referred to allosaurus jimmadseni
the completeness preservation and scientific importance of this skeleton gave big al its name
the individual itself was below the average size for allosaurus fragilis as it was a subadult estimated at only grown
the specimen was described by breithaupt in
nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of serious infection which may have contributed to big als death
pathologic bones included five ribs five vertebrae and four bones of the feet
several of its damaged bones showed signs of osteomyelitis a severe bone infection
a particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait
big al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an involucrum
the infection was long lived perhaps up to six months
big al ii is also known to have multiple injuries
six species of allosaurus have been named a
amplus a
atrox a
europaeus the type species a
fragilis a
jimmadseni and a
among these daniel chure and mark loewen in only recognized the species a
fragilis a
europaeus and the newly named a
jimmadseni as being valid species
however a
europaeus does not show any unique characters compared to the north american species so a reevaluation of its validity is required
fragilis is the type species and was named by marsh in
it is known from the remains of at least individuals all found in the kimmeridgian tithonian upper jurassic age morrison formation of the united states spread across colorado montana new mexico oklahoma south dakota utah and wyoming
details of the humerus of a
fragilis have been used as diagnostic among morrison theropods but a
jimmadseni indicates that this is no longer the case at the species level
jimmadseni has been scientifically described based on two nearly complete skeletons
the first specimen to wear the identification was unearthed in dinosaur national monument in northeastern utah with the original big al individual subsequently recognized as belonging to the same species
this species differs from a
fragilis in several anatomical details including a jugal with a straight lower margin
fossils are confined to the salt wash member of the morrison formation with a
fragilis only found in the higher brushy basin member
fragilis a
jimmadseni a
amplus and a
lucasi are all known from remains discovered in the kimmeridgian tithonian upper jurassic age morrison formation of the united states spread across colorado montana new mexico oklahoma south dakota utah and wyoming
fragilis is regarded as the most common known from the remains of at least individuals
for a while in the late s and early s it was common to recognize a
fragilis as the short snouted species with the long snouted taxon being a
however subsequent analysis of specimens from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry como bluff and dry mesa quarry showed that the differences seen in the morrison formation material could be attributed to individual variation
a study of skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns and the proposed differentiation of a
jimmadseni based on the shape of the jugal
europaeus was found in the kimmeridgian age porto novo member of the lourinh formation but it may be the same as a
allosaurus material from portugal was first reported in on the basis of mhnul and a partial skeleton including a quadrate vertebrae ribs gastralia chevrons part of the hips and legs
this specimen was assigned to a
fragilis but the subsequent discovery of a partial skull and neck near lourinh in the kimmeridgian age porto novo member of the lourinh formation spurred the naming of the new species as a
europaeus by octvio mateus and colleagues
the species appeared earlier in the jurassic than a
fragilis and differs from other species of allosaurus in cranial details
however more material may show it to be a
fragilis as originally described
the issue of species and potential synonyms is complicated by the type specimen of allosaurus fragilis being extremely fragmentary consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae limb fragments rib fragments and a single tooth
because of this several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious meaning the genus allosaurus itself or at least the species a
fragilis would be a nomen dubium
to address this situation gregory s
paul and kenneth carpenter submitted a petition to the iczn to have the name a
fragilis officially transferred to the more complete specimen usnm
creosaurus epanterias and labrosaurus are regarded as junior synonyms of allosaurus
most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of a
fragilis or that were misassigned to the genus are obscure and based on very scrappy remains
one exception is labrosaurus ferox named in by marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down
later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic showing an injury to the living animal and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction
it is now regarded as an example of a
in his book predatory dinosaurs of the world the freelance artist author gregory s
paul proposed that a
fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species a
atrox as well as not being a different sex due to rarity
allosaurus atrox was originally named by marsh in as the type species of its own genus creosaurus and is based on ypm an assortment of bones that includes a couple of pieces of the skull portions of nine tail vertebrae two hip vertebrae an ilium and ankle and foot bones
although the idea of two common morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi technical and popular works the thesis on allosauridae noted that charles gilmore mistakenly reconstructed usnm as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by paul to atrox refuting supposed differences between usnm and putative a
atrox specimens like dino amnh and amnh
allosaurus agilis seen in zittel and osborn is a typographical error for a
allosaurus ferox is a typographical error by marsh for a
fragilis in a figure caption for the partial skull ypm and ypm has been treated as a specimen of a fragilis
likewise labrosaurus fragilis is a typographical error by marsh for labrosaurus ferox
whitei is a nomen nudum coined by pickering in for the complete allosaurus specimens that paul referred to a
madsenius was coined by david lambert in being based on remains from dinosaur national monument assigned to allosaurus or creosaurus and was to be described by paleontologist robert bakker as madsenius trux
however madsenius is now seen as yet another synonym of allosaurus because bakkers action was predicated upon the false assumption of usnm being distinct from long snouted allosaurus due to errors in gilmores reconstruction of usnm
wyomingraptor was informally coined by bakker for allosaurid remains from the morrison formation of the late jurassic
the remains unearthed are labeled as allosaurus and are housed in the tate geological museum
however there has been no official description of the remains and wyomingraptor has been dismissed as a nomen nudum with the remains referable to allosaurus
several species initially classified within or referred to allosaurus do not belong within the genus
medius was named by marsh in for various specimens from the early cretaceous arundel formation of maryland although most of the remains were removed by richard swann lull to the new ornithopod species dryosaurus grandis except for a tooth
it was transferred to antrodemus by oliver hay in but hay later clarified that this was an inexplicable error on his part
gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to dryptosaurus as d
the referral was not accepted in the most recent review of basal tetanurans and allosaurus medius was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod
it may be closely related to acrocanthosaurus
allosaurus valens is a new combination for antrodemus valens used by friedrich von huene in antrodemus valens itself may also pertain to allosaurus fragilis as gilmore suggested in
lucaris another marsh name was given to a partial skeleton in
he later decided it warranted its own genus labrosaurus but this has not been accepted and a
lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of a
allosaurus lucaris is known mostly from vertebrae sharing characters with allosaurus
paul and carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species ypm was from a younger age than allosaurus and might represent a different genus
however they found that the specimen was undiagnostic and thus a
lucaris was a nomen dubium
allosaurus sibiricus was described in by a
riabinin on the basis of a bone later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal from the early cretaceous of buryatia russia
it was transferred to chilantaisaurus in but is now considered a nomen dubium indeterminate beyond theropoda
allosaurus meriani was a new combination by george olshevsky for megalosaurus meriani greppin based on a tooth from the late jurassic of switzerland
however a recent overview of ceratosaurus included it in ceratosaurus sp
apatodon mirus based on a scrap of vertebra marsh first thought to be a mammalian jaw has been listed as a synonym of allosaurus fragilis
however it was considered indeterminate beyond dinosauria by chure and mickey mortimer believes that the synonymy of apatodon with allosaurus was due to correspondence to ralph molnar by john mcintosh whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that othniel charles marsh admitted that the apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra
amplexus was named by gregory s
paul for giant morrison allosaur remains and included in his conception saurophagus maximus
amplexus was originally coined by cope in as the type species of his new genus epanterias and is based on what is now amnh parts of three vertebrae a coracoid and a metatarsal
following pauls work this species has been accepted as a synonym of a
a study by paul and kenneth carpenter however indicates that epanterias is temporally younger than the a
fragilis type specimen so it is a separate species at minimum
maximus was a new combination by david k
smith for chures saurophaganax maximus a taxon created by chure in for giant allosaurid remains from the morrison of oklahoma
these remains had been known as saurophagus but that name was already in use leading chure to propose a substitute
smith in his analysis of variation concluded that s
maximus was not different enough from allosaurus to be a separate genus but did warrant its own species a
this reassignment was rejected in a review of basal tetanurans
there are also several species left over from the synonymizations of creosaurus and labrosaurus with allosaurus
creosaurus potens was named by lull in for a vertebra from the early cretaceous of maryland
it is now regarded as a dubious theropod
labrosaurus stechowi described in by janensch based on isolated ceratosaurus like teeth from the tendaguru beds of tanzania was listed by donald f
glut as a species of allosaurus is now considered a dubious ceratosaurian related to ceratosaurus
sulcatus named by marsh in for a morrison theropod tooth which like l
stechowi is now regarded as a dubious ceratosaurus like ceratosaur
tendagurensis was named in by werner janensch for a partial shin found in the kimmeridgian age tendaguru formation in mtwara tanzania
although tabulated as a tentatively valid species of allosaurus in the second edition of the dinosauria subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond tetanurae either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid
although obscure it was a large theropod possibly around meters long and metric tons in weight
kurzanov and colleagues in designated six teeth from siberia as allosaurus sp
they were reclassified as an indeterminate theropod
also reports of allosaurus in shanxi china go back to at least
these were interpreted as torvosaurus remains in
an astragalus thought to belong to a species of allosaurus was found at cape paterson victoria in early cretaceous beds in southeastern australia
it was thought to provide evidence that australia was a refugium for animals that had gone extinct elsewhere
this identification was challenged by samuel welles who thought it more resembled that of an ornithomimid but the original authors defended their identification
with fifteen years of new specimens and research to look at daniel chure reexamined the bone and found that it was not allosaurus but could represent an allosauroid
similarly yoichi azuma and phil currie in their description of fukuiraptor noted that the bone closely resembled that of their new genus
this specimen is sometimes referred to as allosaurus robustus an informal museum name
it likely belonged to something similar to australovenator although one study considered it to belong to an abelisaur
allosaurus was a typical large theropod having a massive skull on a short neck a long slightly sloping tail and reduced forelimbs
allosaurus fragilis the best known species had an average length of and mass of with the largest definitive allosaurus specimen estimated at long with an estimated weight of
in his monograph on allosaurus james h
madsen mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of
as with dinosaurs in general weight estimates are debatable and since have ranged between and approximately for modal adult weight
john foster a specialist on the morrison formation suggests that is reasonable for large adults of a
fragilis but that is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average sized thigh bones he has measured
using the subadult specimen nicknamed big al since assigned to the species allosaurus jimmadseni researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of for the individual but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately to approximately
europaeus has been measured up to in length and in body mass
several gigantic specimens have been attributed to allosaurus but may in fact belong to other genera
the closely related genus saurophaganax reached perhaps in length and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus allosaurus as allosaurus maximus though recent studies support it as a separate genus
another potential specimen of allosaurus once assigned to the genus epanterias may have measured in length
a more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the peterson quarry in morrison rocks of new mexico this large allosaurid may be another individual of saurophaganax
david k
smith examining allosaurus fossils by quarry found that the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry specimens are generally smaller than those from como bluff or brigham young universitys dry mesa quarry but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites
a later study by smith incorporating garden park and dinosaur national monument specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation skull variation was most common and was gradational suggesting individual variation was responsible
further work on size related variation again found no consistent differences although the dry mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the astragalus an ankle bone
kenneth carpenter using skull elements from the cleveland lloyd site found wide variation between individuals calling into question previous species level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the horns and the proposed differentiation of a
jimmadseni based on the shape of the jugal
a study published by motani et al
in suggests that allosaurus was also sexually dimorphic in the width of the femurs head against its length
the skull and teeth of allosaurus were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size
paleontologist gregory s
paul gives a length of for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long
each premaxilla held five teeth with d shaped cross sections and each maxilla had between and teeth the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone
each dentary had between and teeth with an average count of
the teeth became shorter narrower and more curved toward the back of the skull
all of the teeth had saw like edges
they were shed easily and were replaced continually making them common fossils
its skull was light robust and equipped with dozens of sharp serrated teeth
the skull had a pair of horns above and in front of the eyes
these horns were composed of extensions of the lacrimal bones and varied in shape and size
there were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns
the horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions including acting as sunshades for the eyes being used for display and being used in combat against other members of the same species
there was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment as is also seen in tyrannosaurids
inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held glands such as salt glands
within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as ceratosaurus and marshosaurus they may have been related to the sense of smell perhaps holding something like jacobsons organs
the roof of the braincase was thin perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain
the skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units
in the lower jaws the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animals gape
the braincase and frontals may also have had a joint
allosaurus had nine vertebrae in the neck in the back and five in the sacrum supporting the hips
the number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size james madsen estimated about while gregory s
paul considered that to be too many and suggested or less
there were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae
such spaces which are also found in modern theropods are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration
the rib cage was broad giving it a barrel chest especially in comparison to less derived theropods like ceratosaurus
allosaurus had gastralia but these are not common findings and they may have ossified poorly
in one published case the gastralia show evidence of injury during life
a furcula was also present but has only been recognized since in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia
the ilium the main hip bone was massive and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground
madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry independent of size the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends
he suggested that this was a sexual characteristic with females lacking fused bones to make egg laying easier
this proposal has not attracted further attention however
the forelimbs of allosaurus were short in comparison to the hindlimbs and had three fingers per hand tipped with large strongly curved and pointed claws
the arms were powerful and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm
the wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans
of the three fingers the innermost was the largest and diverged from the others
the phalangeal formula is meaning that the innermost finger has two bones the next has three and the third finger has four
the legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof like than those of earlier theropods
each foot had three weight bearing toes and an inner dewclaw which madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles
there was also what is interpreted as the splint like remnant of a fifth metatarsal perhaps used as a lever between the achilles tendon and foot
skin impressions from allosaurus have been described
one impression from a juvenile specimen measures cm and is associated with the anterior dorsal ribs pectoral region
the impression show small scales measuring mm in diameter
a large skin impression from the big al two specimen associated with the base of the tail measures cm x cm and show large scales measuring up to cm in diameter
however it has been noted that these scales are more similar to those of sauropods and due to the presence of non theropod remains associated with the tail of big al two there is a possibility that this skin impression is not from allosaurus
another allosaurus fossil feature a skin impression from the mandible showing scales measuring mm in diameter
the same fossil also preserves skin impressions from the ventral side of the neck showing broad scutes
a small skin impression from an allosaurus skull has been reported but never described
allosaurus was an allosaurid a member of a family of large theropods within the larger group carnosauria
the family name allosauridae was created for this genus in by othniel charles marsh but the term was largely unused until the s in favor of megalosauridae another family of large theropods that eventually became a wastebasket taxon
this along with the use of antrodemus for allosaurus during the same period is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on allosaurus in publications that predate james madsens monograph
major publications using the name megalosauridae instead of allosauridae include gilmore von huene romer and steel and walker
following the publication of madsens influential monograph allosauridae became the preferred family assignment but it too was not strongly defined
semi technical works used allosauridae for a variety of large theropods usually those that were larger and better known than megalosaurids
typical theropods that were thought to be related to allosaurus included indosaurus piatnitzkysaurus piveteausaurus yangchuanosaurus acrocanthosaurus chilantaisaurus compsosuchus stokesosaurus and szechuanosaurus
given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of evolutionary relationships none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid although several like acrocanthosaurus and yangchuanosaurus are members of closely related families
below is a cladogram based on the analysis of benson et al
allosauridae is one of four families in allosauroidea the other three are neovenatoridae carcharodontosauridae and sinraptoridae
allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the tyrannosauridae one example being gregory s
pauls predatory dinosaurs of the world but this has been rejected with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods the coelurosauria
allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families with only saurophaganax and a currently unnamed french allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides allosaurus in the most recent review
another genus epanterias is a potential valid member but it and saurophaganax may turn out to be large examples of allosaurus
recent reviews have kept the genus saurophaganax and included epanterias with allosaurus
the wealth of allosaurus fossils from nearly all ages of individuals allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been
remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggs crushed eggs from colorado have been suggested as those of allosaurus
based on histological analysis of limb bones bone deposition appears to stop at around to years which is comparable to that of other large theropods like tyrannosaurus
from the same analysis its maximum growth appears to have been at age with an estimated growth rate of about kilograms per year
medullary bone tissue has been reported in at least one allosaurus specimen a shin bone from the cleveland lloyd quarry
today this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs as it is used to supply calcium to shells
its presence in the allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age
however other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs including this allosaurus individual
data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead
however with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating sex in a specimen of tyrannosaurus it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the allosaurus in question was indeed female
the discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles and the lower segments of the leg were relatively longer than the thigh
these differences suggest that younger allosaurus were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood
the thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth and the cross section less circular as muscle attachments shifted muscles became shorter and the growth of the leg slowed
these changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults which would have moved with more regular forward progression
conversely the skull bones appear to have generally grown isometrically increasing in size without changing in proportion
many paleontologists accept allosaurus as an active predator of large animals
there is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on stegosaurus including an allosaurus tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a stegosaurus tail spike and a stegosaurus neck plate with a u shaped wound that correlates well with an allosaurus snout
sauropods seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of scavenging based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones
however as gregory paul noted in allosaurus was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods unless it hunted in packs as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods
another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults
research in the s and the first decade of the st century may have found other solutions to this question
robert t
bakker comparing allosaurus to cenozoic saber toothed carnivorous mammals found similar adaptations such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide
although allosaurus did not have saber teeth bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a saw like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw which would have been driven into prey
this type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey with the goal of weakening the victim
similar conclusions were drawn by another study using finite element analysis on an allosaurus skull
according to their biomechanical analysis the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force
by using jaw muscles only it could produce a bite force of to n but the skull could withstand nearly n of vertical force against the tooth row
the authors suggested that allosaurus used its skull like a machete against prey attacking open mouthed slashing flesh with its teeth and tearing it away without splintering bones unlike tyrannosaurus which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones
they also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods but strong enough for high impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods
their interpretations were challenged by other researchers who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey
the original authors noted that allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent that the tooth row is well suited to such an attack and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress
another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like allosaurus were flesh grazers which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright
this strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later
an additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats grasping the prey with their forelimbs and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea
this is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey
studies done by stephen lautenschager et al
from the university of bristol also indicate allosaurus could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force
when compared with tyrannosaurus and the therizinosaurid erlikosaurus in the same study it was found that allosaurus had a wider gape than either the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a degree angle at maximum
the findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs like modern carnivores had wider jaw gapes than herbivores
a biomechanical study published in by eric snively and colleagues found that allosaurus had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the longissimus capitis superficialis neck muscle compared to other theropods such as tyrannosaurus
this would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull
the authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by bakker and rayfield are consistent with the animals capabilities
they also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to falcons such as kestrels the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet then pulled back and up to remove flesh
this differs from the prey handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull similar to crocodilians
in addition allosaurus was able to move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control at the cost of power
other aspects of feeding include the eyes arms and legs
the shape of the skull of allosaurus limited potential binocular vision to of width slightly less than that of modern crocodilians
as with crocodilians this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks
the arms compared with those of other theropods were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things
finally the top speed of allosaurus has been estimated at to kilometers per hour
a paper on the cranio dental morphology of allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow allosaurus to deliver a muscle driven bite to large prey with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade off to allow for the widened gape
it has been speculated since the s that allosaurus preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups
such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature
robert t
bakker has extended social behavior to parental care and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food
however there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls
such head biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes
although allosaurus may have hunted in packs it has been argued that allosaurus and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species
the study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs is rare among vertebrates in general and modern diapsid carnivores rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way
instead they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites
according to this interpretation the accumulation of remains of multiple allosaurus individuals at the same site eg in the cleveland lloyd quarry are not due to pack hunting but to the fact that allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs and were sometimes killed in the process
this could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and komodo dragons
the same interpretation applies to bakkers lair sites
there is some evidence for cannibalism in allosaurus including allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at bakkers lair sites
the brain of allosaurus as interpreted from spiral ct scanning of an endocast was more consistent with crocodilian brains than those of the other living archosaurs birds
the structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal as opposed to strongly tipped up or down
the structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian and so allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best and would have had trouble with subtle sounds
the olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small
in bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior
since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury
stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand
allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb
when the researchers looked for stress fractures they found that allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than albertosaurus ornithomimus or archaeornithomimus
of the hand bones the researchers studied three were found to contain stress fractures
of the feet bones were studied and were found to have stress fractures
the stress fractures in the foot bones were distributed to the proximal phalanges and occurred across all three weight bearing toes in statistically indistinguishable numbers
since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress
if the allosaurs stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others
the lack of such a bias in the examined allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running
the authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet
the abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in allosaurus provide evidence for very active predation based rather than scavenging diets
the left scapula and fibula of an allosaurus fragilis specimen catalogued as usnm are both pathological both probably due to healed fractures
the specimen usnm preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle
some of the fractures were poorly healed and formed pseudoarthroses
a specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the cleveland lloyd quarry
another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail
an apparent subadult male allosaurus fragilis was reported to have extensive pathologies with a total of fourteen separate injuries
the specimen mor had pathologies on five ribs the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae the second tail vertebra and its chevron the gastralia right scapula manual phalanx i left ilium metatarsals iii and v the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second
the ilium had a large hole
caused by a blow from above
the near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an involucrum
allosaurus was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of western american fossil bearing rock known as the morrison formation accounting for to of theropod specimens and as such was at the top trophic level of the morrison food chain
the morrison formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons and flat floodplains
vegetation varied from river lining forests of conifers tree ferns and ferns to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the araucaria like conifer brachyphyllum
the morrison formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground
the flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae fungi mosses horsetails ferns cycads ginkgoes and several families of conifers
animal fossils discovered include bivalves snails ray finned fishes frogs salamanders turtles sphenodonts lizards terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphs several species of pterosaur numerous dinosaur species and early mammals such as docodonts multituberculates symmetrodonts and triconodonts
dinosaurs known from the morrison include the theropods ceratosaurus ornitholestes tanycolagreus and torvosaurus the sauropods haplocanthosaurus camarasaurus cathetosaurus brachiosaurus suuwassea apatosaurus brontosaurus barosaurus diplodocus supersaurus amphicoelias and maraapunisaurus and the ornithischians camptosaurus dryosaurus and stegosaurus
allosaurus is commonly found at the same sites as apatosaurus camarasaurus diplodocus and stegosaurus
the late jurassic formations of portugal where allosaurus is present are interpreted as having been similar to the morrison but with a stronger marine influence
many of the dinosaurs of the morrison formation are the same genera as those seen in portuguese rocks or have a close counterpart
allosaurus coexisted with fellow large theropods ceratosaurus and torvosaurus in both the united states and portugal
the three appear to have had different ecological niches based on anatomy and the location of fossils
ceratosaurus and torvosaurus may have preferred to be active around waterways and had lower thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains whereas allosaurus was more compact with longer legs faster but less maneuverable and seems to have preferred dry floodplains
ceratosaurus better known than torvosaurus differed noticeably from allosaurus in functional anatomy by having a taller narrower skull with large broad teeth
allosaurus was itself a potential food item to other carnivores as illustrated by an allosaurus pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod probably ceratosaurus or torvosaurus
the location of the bone in the body and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton indicates that the allosaurus was being scavenged
a bone assemblage in the upper jurassic mygatt moore quarry preserves an unusually high occurrence of theropod bite marks most of which can be attributed to allosaurus and ceratosaurus while others could have been made by saurophaganax or torvosaurus given the size of the striations
while the position of the bite marks on the herbivorous dinosaurs is consistent with predation or early access to remains bite marks found on allosaurus material suggest scavenging either from the other theropods or from another allosaurus
the unusually high concentration of theropod bite marks compared to other assemblages could be explained either by a more complete utilization of resources during a dry season by theropods or by a collecting bias in other localities
the ak officially known as the avtomat kalashnikova is a gas operated assault rifle that is chambered for the mm cartridge
developed in the soviet union by russian small arms designer mikhail kalashnikov it is the originating firearm of the kalashnikov family of rifles
after more than seven decades since its creation the ak model and its variants remain one of the most popular and widely used firearms in the world
design work on the ak began in
it was presented for official military trials in and in the fixed stock version was introduced into active service for selected units of the soviet army
in early the ak was officially accepted by the soviet armed forces and used by the majority of the member states of the warsaw pact
the model and its variants owe their global popularity to their reliability under harsh conditions low production cost availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use
the ak has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies throughout the world
of the estimated million firearms worldwide approximately million belong to the kalashnikov family three quarters of which are ak s
the model is the basis for the development of many other types of individual crew served and specialized firearms
during world war ii the sturmgewehr rifle used by german forces made a deep impression on their soviet counterparts
the select fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge the mm kurz and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle
on july an earlier model of the sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the peoples commissariat of arms of the ussr
the soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own to replace the ppsh submachine guns and outdated mosin nagant bolt action rifles that armed most of the soviet army
the soviets soon developed the mm m cartridge used in the semi automatic sks carbine and the rpd light machine gun
shortly after world war ii the soviets developed the ak rifle which quickly replaced the sks in soviet service
introduced in the akm is a lighter stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire ak series of firearms
in the s the soviets introduced the rpk light machine gun an ak type weapon with a stronger receiver a longer heavy barrel and a bipod that eventually replaced the rpd light machine gun
mikhail kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in while recuperating from a shoulder wound which he received during the battle of bryansk
kalashnikov himself stated
i was in the hospital and a soldier in the bed beside me asked why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men when the germans have automatics so i designed one
i was a soldier and i created a machine gun for a soldier
it was called an avtomat kalashnikova the automatic weapon of kalashnikov ak and it carried the year of its first manufacture
the ak is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations
kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the american m garand and the german stg
kalashnikovs team had access to these weapons and had no need to reinvent the wheel
kalashnikov himself observed a lot of russian army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor and how new weaponry is designed
these are very difficult questions
each designer seems to have his own paths his own successes and failures
but one thing is clear before attempting to create something new it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field
i myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so
some claimed that kalashnikov copied designs like bulkins tkb or simonovs avs
kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in and light machine gun design in
early in kalashnikov was given some mm m cartridges and informed that other designers were working on weapons for this new soviet small arms cartridge
it was suggested that a new weapon might well lead to greater things
he then undertook work on the new rifle
in he entered a design competition with this new mm semi automatic gas operated long stroke piston carbine strongly influenced by the american m garand
the new rifle was in the same class as the sks carbine with a fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel
however the new kalashnikov design lost out to a simonov design
in a new design competition was initiated to develop a new rifle
kalashnikov submitted a gas operated rifle with a short stroke gas piston above the barrel a breechblock mechanism similar to his carbine and a curved round magazine
kalashnikovs rifles the ak and ak proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to a second round of competition along with other designs
these prototypes had a rotary bolt a two part receiver with separate trigger unit housing dual controls and a non reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon
this design had many similarities to the stg
in late as the rifles were being tested one of kalashnikovs assistants aleksandr zaitsev suggested a major redesign to improve reliability
at first kalashnikov was reluctant given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors
eventually however zaitsev managed to persuade kalashnikov
in november the new prototypes were completed
the rifle used a long stroke gas piston above the barrel
the upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver
the selector and safety were combined into a single control lever dust cover on the right side of the rifle
and the bolt handle was simply attached to the bolt carrier
this simplified the design and production of the rifle
the first army trial series began in early
the new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions and possessed convenient handling characteristics
in it was adopted by the soviet army as mm kalashnikov rifle
there were many difficulties during the initial phase of production
the first production models had stamped sheet metal receivers with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert and a stamped body
difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates
instead of halting production a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver
even though production of these milled rifles started in they were officially referred to as ak based on the date their development started but they are widely known in the collectors and current commercial market as type ak
this was a more costly process but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier mosin nagant rifles machined receiver were easily adapted
partly because of these problems the soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until
during this time production of the interim sks rifle continued
once the manufacturing difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome a redesigned version designated the akm was introduced in
this new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted muzzle brake on the end of the barrel to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil
in addition a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery during rapid or fully automatic fire
this is also sometimes referred to as a cyclic rate reducer or simply rate reducer as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire
the rifle was also roughly one third lighter than the previous model
most licensed and unlicensed productions of the kalashnikov assault rifle abroad were of the akm variant partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver
this model is the most commonly encountered having been produced in much greater quantities
all rifles based on the kalashnikov design are often colloquially referred to as ak s in the west and some parts of asia although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types
in most former eastern bloc countries the weapon is known simply as the kalashnikov or ak
the differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine
in the soviets began replacing their ak and akm rifles with a newer design the ak which uses mm ammunition
this new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in eastern european nations when the soviet union collapsed drastically slowing production of the ak and other weapons of the former soviet bloc
the ak was designed to be a simple reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply using mass production methods that were state of the art in the soviet union during the late s
the ak uses a long stroke gas system generally associated with high reliability in adverse conditions
the large gas piston generous clearance between moving parts and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle
the ak fires the mm cartridge with a muzzle velocity of

the original soviet m bullets are grain boat tail bullets with a copper plated steel jacket a large steel core and some lead between the core and the jacket
the ak has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage walls or a common vehicles metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover
the mm m projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone
the mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles in tissue but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw
in the absence of yaw the m round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury
most if not all of the mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded m variety
this variety deleted the steel insert shifting the center of gravity rearward and allowing the projectile to destabilize at about nearly earlier in tissue than the m round
this change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to for the newer m round versus for the older m round
however the wounding potential of m is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes especially when the bullet yaws
to fire the operator inserts a loaded magazine pulls back and releases the charging handle and then pulls the trigger
in semi automatic the firearm fires only once requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot
in fully automatic the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger
after ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle
the build up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long stroke piston and bolt carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide rotates the bolt approximately and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt
the moving assembly has about of free travel which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken
the ak does not have a gas valve excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder
unlike many other rifle platforms such as the ar platform the kalashnikov platform bolt locking lugs are chamfered allowing for primary extraction upon bolt rotation which aids reliable feeding and extraction albeit not with that much force due to the short distance the bolt carrier travels before acting on the locking lug
the kalashnikov platform then uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case
the rifle received a barrel with a chrome lined bore and four right hand grooves at a mm or calibers rifling twist rate
the gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis
the muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a muzzle brake or a blank firing adaptor
the gas block of the ak features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop
gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder
the fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle it acts as a dust cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe
it is operated by the shooters right fore fingers and has three settings safe full auto and semi auto
the reason for this is that a soldier under stress will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full auto stage and setting the rifle to semi auto
to set the ak to full auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever
to operate the fire selector lever right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip which is ergonomically sub optimal
some ak type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip
this lever is operated by the shooters right thumb and has three settings safe full auto and semi auto
the ak uses a notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in increments from
the front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field
horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue
the sight line elements are approximately over the bore axis
the point blank range battle zero setting standing for on the mm ak rear tangent sight element corresponds to a zero
these settings mirror the mosin nagant and sks rifles which the ak replaced
for the ak combined with service cartridges the m battle zero setting limits the apparent bullet rise within approximately relative to the line of sight
soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass of the enemy target
any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant as a well aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier
some ak type rifles have a front sight with a flip up luminous dot that is calibrated at for improved night fighting
the ak was originally equipped with a buttstock handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood
with the introduction of the type receiver the buttstock lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from birch plywood laminates
such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one piece patterns do not require lengthy maturing and are cheaper
the wooden furniture was finished with the russian amber shellac finishing process
aks and akms models featured a downward folding metal butt stock similar to that of the german mp submachine gun for use in the restricted space in the bmp infantry combat vehicle as well as by paratroops
all series aks use plastic furniture with side folding stocks
the standard magazine capacity is rounds
there are also and round box magazines as well as round drum magazines
the ak s standard round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber
their heavy steel construction combined with feed lips machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage
these magazines are so strong that soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers and even bottle openers
this contributes to the ak magazine being more reliable but makes it heavier than us and nato magazines
the early slab sided steel ak round detachable box magazines had sheet metal bodies and weighed empty
the later steel akm round magazines had lighter sheet metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing empty
to further reduce weight a lightweight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing empty was developed for the akm that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines was quickly withdrawn from service
as a replacement steel reinforced round plastic mm box magazines were introduced
these rust colored magazines weigh empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of bakelite but were actually fabricated from two parts of ag s molding compound assembled using an epoxy resin adhesive
noted for their durability these magazines did however compromise the rifles camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations
a second generation steel reinforced dark brown round mm magazine was introduced in the early s fabricated from abs plastic
the third generation steel reinforced round mm magazine is similar to the second generation but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish
the current issue steel reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished mm round magazines fabricated from abs plastic weigh empty
early steel ak magazines are long the later ribbed steel akm and newer plastic mm magazines are about shorter
the transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight
all mm ak magazines are backwards compatible with older ak variants
kg is the maximum amount of ammo that the average soldier can comfortably carry
it also allows for best comparison of the three most common mm ak magazines
most yugoslavian and some east german ak magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty however most ak magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty
accessories supplied with the rifle include a long h bayonet featuring a long spear point blade
the ak bayonet is installed by slipping the diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base
all current model akm rifles can mount under barrel mm grenade launchers such as the gp and its variants which can fire up to rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to metres
the main grenade is the vog fragmentation grenade which has a m lethality radius
the vog p vog pm variant explodes above the ground
the ak can also mount a cup type grenade launcher the kalashnikov grenade launcher that fires standard rgd soviet hand grenades
the maximum effective range is approximately meters
this launcher can also be used to launch tear gas and riot control grenades
all current aks and some older models have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices such as the pso optical sniper sight
the side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic
however the series side folding stocks cannot be folded with the optics mounted
the ak and its variants have been and are made in dozens of countries with quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship
as a result the ak has a service system life of approximately to to rounds
the ak was designed to be a cheap simple easy to manufacture rifle perfectly matching soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items
as units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on battlefield cannibalization for resupply it is actually more cost effective to replace rather than repair weapons
the ak has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds
however every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon
some parts of the ak line are riveted together
repairing these can be quite a hassle since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced
for the further developed ak models see kalashnikov rifles
manufacturing countries of ak and its variants in alphabetical order
a private company kalashnikov concern from russia has repeatedly claimed that the majority of foreign manufacturers are producing ak type rifles without proper licensing
the ak s accuracy has always been considered to be good enough to hit an adult male torso out to about though even experts firing from prone or bench rest positions at this range were observed to have difficulty placing ten consecutive rounds on target
later designs did not significantly improve the rifles accuracy
an ak can fire a shot group of at and at the newer stamped steel receiver akm models while more rugged and less prone to metal fatigue are actually less accurate than the forged milled receivers of their predecessors the milled ak s are capable of shooting groups at whereas the stamped akms are capable of shooting groups at
the best shooters are able to hit a man sized target at within five shots or ten shots
under worst field exercise circumstances the hit probabilities for all the tested rifles were drastically reduced at m down to at m with no significant differences between weapons at each range
the following table represents the russian method for determining accuracy which is far more complex than western methods
in the west one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measures the overall diameter of the group
the russians on the other hand fire a group of shots into the target
they then draw two circles on the target one for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits
they then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits on the inner part of the circles
this dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups
they then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy
this circular error probable method used by the russians and other european militaries cannot be converted and is not comparable to us military methods for determining rifle accuracy
when the r results are doubled the hit probability increases to
the vertical and horizontal mean deviations with service ammunition at for ak platforms are
throughout the world the ak and its variants are commonly used by governments revolutionaries terrorists criminals and civilians alike
in some countries such as somalia rwanda mozambique congo and tanzania the prices for black market aks are between and per weapon and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting
in kenya an ak fetches five head of cattle when offered for barter but costs almost half that price when cash is paid
there are places around the world where ak type weapons can be purchased on the black market for as little as or traded for a chicken or a sack of grain
the ak has also spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured in small shops around the world
the estimated numbers of ak type weapons vary greatly
the small arms survey suggest that between and million of these weapons have been produced since
the world bank estimates that out of the million total firearms available worldwide million are of the kalashnikov family and million are ak s
because ak type weapons have been made in many countries often illicitly it is impossible to know how many really exist
during the cold war the soviet union and the peoples republic of china as well as united states and other nato nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world
during this time the western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles such as the fn fal the hk g the m and the m
in contrast the russians and chinese used the ak its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make aks in vast numbers
in the pro communist states the ak became a symbol of the third world revolution
they were utilized in the cambodian civil war and the cambodian vietnamese war
during the s the soviet union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by western nations including middle eastern nations such as libya and syria which welcomed soviet union backing against israel
after the fall of the soviet union ak s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash including drug cartels and dictatorial states and more recently they have been seen in the hands of islamic groups such as al qaeda isil and the taliban in afghanistan and iraq and farc ejrcito de liberacin nacional guerrillas in colombia
in russia the kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride
the family of the inventor of the worlds most famous rifle mikhail kalashnikov has authorized german engineering company mmi to use the well known kalashnikov name on a variety of not so deadly goods
in recent years kalashnikov vodka has been marketed with souvenir bottles in the shape of the ak kalashnikov
there are also kalashnikov watches umbrellas and knives
the kalashnikov museum opened on november in izhevsk udmurt republic
this city is in the ural region of russia
the museum chronicles the biography of general kalashnikov and documents the invention of the ak
the museum complex of kalashnikovs small arms a series of halls and multimedia exhibitions are devoted to the evolution of the ak rifle and attracts monthly visitors
nadezhda vechtomova the museum director stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country
on september a monument of kalashnikov was unveiled in central moscow
a protester later detained by police attempted to unfurl a banner reading a creator of weapons is a creator of death
the proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers
the ak is included on the flag of mozambique and its emblem an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their ak s
it is also found in the coats of arms of east timor zimbabwe and the revolution era burkina faso as well as in the flags of hezbollah syrian resistance farc ep the new peoples army tkp tikko and the international revolutionary peoples guerrilla forces
us and western europe countries frequently associate the ak with their enemies both cold war era and present day
for example western works of fiction often portray criminals gang members insurgents and terrorists using ak s as the weapon of choice
conversely throughout the developing world the ak can be positively attributed with revolutionaries against foreign occupation imperialism or colonialism
in ireland the ak is associated with the troubles due to its extensive use by republican paramilitaries during this period
in a decommissioned ak was included in the a history of ireland in objects collection
the ak made an appearance in us popular culture as a recurring focus in the nicolas cage film lord of war
numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon and its effects on global conflict and the gun running market
in iraq and afghanistan private military company contractors from the uk and other countries used the ak and its variants along with western firearms such as the ar
in the colombian musician and peace activist csar lpez devised the escopetarra an ak converted into a guitar
one sold for us in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of anti personnel mines while another was exhibited at the united nations conference on disarmament
in mexico the ak is known as cuerno de chivo because of its curved magazine design
it is one of the weapons of choice of mexican drug cartels
it is sometimes mentioned in mexican folk music lyrics
the atanasoff berry computer was the first automatic electronic digital computer
limited by the technology of the day and execution the device has remained somewhat obscure
the abcs priority is debated among historians of computer technology because it was neither programmable nor turing complete
conventionally the abc would be considered the first electronic alu which is integrated into every modern processors design
its unique contribution was to make computing faster by being the first to use vacuum tubes to do the arithmetic calculations
prior to this slower electro mechanical methods were used by konrad zuses z computer and the simultaneously developed harvard mark i
the first electronic programmable digital machine the colossus computer from to used similar tube based technology as abc
conceived in the machine was built by iowa state college mathematics and physics professor john vincent atanasoff with the help of graduate student clifford berry
it was designed only to solve systems of linear equations and was successfully tested in
however its intermediate result storage mechanism a paper card writer reader was not perfected and when john vincent atanasoff left iowa state college for world war ii assignments work on the machine was discontinued
the abc pioneered important elements of modern computing including binary arithmetic and electronic switching elements but its special purpose nature and lack of a changeable stored program distinguish it from modern computers
the computer was designated an ieee milestone in
atanasoff and berrys computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the s amidst patent disputes over the first instance of an electronic computer
at that time eniac that had been created by john mauchly and j
presper eckert was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense but in a us district court invalidated the eniac patent and concluded that the eniac inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from atanasoff
when in the mid s the secrecy surrounding the british world war ii development of the colossus computers that pre dated eniac was lifted and colossus was described at a conference in los alamos new mexico in june john mauchly and konrad zuse were reported to have been astonished
according to atanasoffs account several key principles of the atanasoff berry computer were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive to rock island illinois during the winter of
the abc innovations included electronic computation binary arithmetic parallel processing regenerative capacitor memory and a separation of memory and computing functions
the mechanical and logic design was worked out by atanasoff over the next year
a grant application to build a proof of concept prototype was submitted in march to the agronomy department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis
of further funding to complete the machine came from the nonprofit research corporation of new york city
the abc was built by atanasoff and berry in the basement of the physics building at iowa state college during
the initial funds were released in september and the tube prototype was first demonstrated in october
a december demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full scale machine
the abc was built and tested over the next two years
a january story in the des moines register announced the abc as an electrical computing machine with more than vacuum tubes that would compute complicated algebraic equations
the system weighed more than
it contained approximately of wire dual triode vacuum tubes thyratrons and was about the size of a desk
it was not programmable which distinguishes it from more general machines of the same era such as konrad zuses z and the colossus computers of
nor did it implement the stored program architecture first implemented in the manchester baby of required for fully general purpose practical computing machines
the memory of the atanasoff berry computer was a system called regenerative capacitor memory which consisted of a pair of drums each containing capacitors that rotated on a common shaft once per second
the capacitors on each drum were organized into bands of giving the machine a speed of additions subtractions per second
data was represented as bit binary fixed point numbers
the electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on such numbers at a time
the alternating current power line frequency of hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest level operations
the arithmetic logic functions were fully electronic implemented with vacuum tubes
the family of logic gates ranged from inverters to two and three input gates
the input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates
each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function
the control logic functions which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed were electromechanical implemented with relays
the alu operated on only one bit of each number at a time it kept the carry borrow bit in a capacitor for use in the next ac cycle
although the atanasoff berry computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem
an operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions much like the electro mechanical calculators and unit record equipment of the time
selection of the operation to be performed reading writing converting to or from binary to decimal or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers
there were two forms of input and output primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input
the intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory
intermediate results were binary written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at locations to represent of the bit numbers
each sheet could be written or read in one second
the reliability of the system was limited to about error in calculations by these units primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets material characteristics
in retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written
this problem was not solved by the time atanasoff left the university for war related work
primary user input was decimal via standard ibm column punched cards and output was decimal via a front panel display
the abc was designed for a specific purpose the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations
it could handle systems with up to equations a difficult problem for the time
problems of this scale were becoming common in physics the department in which john atanasoff worked
the machine could be fed two linear equations with up to variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables
this process would be repeated manually for each of the equations which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable
then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable
george w
snedecor the head of iowa states statistics department was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems
he submitted many of these problems to atanasoff
on june j
presper eckert and john mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device much to the surprise of atanasoff
the abc had been examined by john mauchly in june and isaac auerbach a former student of mauchlys alleged that it influenced his later work on eniac although mauchly denied this
the eniac patent did not issue until and by honeywell sued sperry rand in an attempt to break the eniac patents arguing that the abc constituted prior art
the united states district court for the district of minnesota released its judgement on october finding in honeywell v
sperry rand that the eniac patent was a derivative of john atanasoffs invention
the case was legally resolved on october when us district judge earl r
larson held the eniac patent invalid ruling that the eniac derived many basic ideas from the atanasoff berry computer
judge larson explicitly stated the original abc was eventually dismantled in when the university converted the basement to classrooms and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded
in a team of researchers led by dr delwyn bluhm and john gustafson from ames laboratory finished building a working replica of the atanasoff berry computer at a cost of
the replica abc was on display in the first floor lobby of the durham center for computation and communication at iowa state university and was subsequently exhibited at the computer history museum
the andes andes mountains or andean mountain range are the longest continental mountain range in the world forming a continuous highland along the western edge of south america
the range is long wide and has an average height of about
the andes extend from north to south through seven south american countries venezuela colombia ecuador peru bolivia chile and argentina
along their length the andes are split into several ranges separated by intermediate depressions
the andes are the location of several high plateaus some of which host major cities such as quito bogot cali arequipa medelln bucaramanga sucre mrida el alto and la paz
the altiplano plateau is the worlds second highest after the tibetan plateau
these ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate the tropical andes the dry andes and the wet andes
the andes mountains are the highest mountain range outside asia
the highest mountain outside asia argentinas aconcagua rises to an elevation of about above sea level
the peak of chimborazo in the ecuadorian andes is farther from the earths center than any other location on the earths surface due to the equatorial bulge resulting from the earths rotation
the worlds highest volcanoes are in the andes including ojos del salado on the chile argentina border which rises to
the andes are also part of the american cordillera a chain of mountain ranges that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of the americas and antarctica
the etymology of the word andes has been debated
the majority consensus is that it derives from the quechua word east as in antisuyu one of the four regions of the inca empire
the term cordillera comes from the spanish word cordel rope and is used as a descriptive name for several contiguous sections of the andes as well as the entire andean range and the combined mountain chain along the western part of the north and south american continents
the leeward antilles islands aruba bonaire and curaao which lie in the caribbean sea off the coast of venezuela were formerly thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the andes range but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the south american and caribbean plates
the andes are a mesozoic tertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the pacific ring of fire a zone of volcanic activity that encompasses the pacific rim of the americas as well as the asia pacific region
the andes are the result of tectonic plate processes caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the south american plate as the nazca plate and south american plate converge
these processes were accelerated by the effects of climate
as the uplift of the andes created a rain shadow on the western fringes of chile ocean currents and prevailing winds carried moisture away from the chilean coast
this caused some areas of the subduction zone to be sediment starved causing excess friction and an increased rate of compressed coastal uplift
the main cause of the rise of the andes is the compression of the western rim of the south american plate due to the subduction of the nazca plate and the antarctic plate
to the east the andes range is bounded by several sedimentary basins such as orinoco amazon basin madre de dios and gran chaco that separate the andes from the ancient cratons in eastern south america
in the south the andes share a long boundary with the former patagonia terrane
to the west the andes end at the pacific ocean although the peru chile trench can be considered their ultimate western limit
from a geographical approach the andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and less rugged topography
the andes mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range
the andean orogen has a series of bends or oroclines
the bolivian orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of south america and the andes mountains at about s
at this point the orientation of the andes turns from northwest in peru to south in chile and argentina
the andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated to counter clockwise and clockwise respectively
the bolivian orocline area overlaps with the area of the maximum width of the altiplano plateau and according to isacks the orocline is related to crustal shortening
the specific point at s where the coastline bends is known as the arica elbow
further south lies the maipo orocline a more subtle orocline between s and s with a seaward concave break in trend at s
near the southern tip of the andes lies the patagonian orocline
the western rim of the south american plate has been the place of several pre andean orogenies since at least the late proterozoic and early paleozoic when several terranes and microcontinents collided and amalgamated with the ancient cratons of eastern south america by then the south american part of gondwana
the formation of the modern andes began with the events of the triassic when pangaea began the break up that resulted in developing several rifts
the development continued through the jurassic period
it was during the cretaceous period that the andes began to take their present form by the uplifting faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks of the ancient cratons to the east
the rise of the andes has not been constant as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress uplift and erosion
tectonic forces above the subduction zone along the entire west coast of south america where the nazca plate and a part of the antarctic plate are sliding beneath the south american plate continue to produce an ongoing orogenic event resulting in minor to major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day
in the extreme south a major transform fault separates tierra del fuego from the small scotia plate
across the wide drake passage lie the mountains of the antarctic peninsula south of the scotia plate which appear to be a continuation of the andes chain
the far east regions of the andes experience a series of changes resulting from the andean orogeny
parts of the sunss orogen in amazonian craton disappeared from the surface of the earth being overridden by the andes
the sierras de crdoba where the effects of the ancient pampean orogeny can be observed owe their modern uplift and relief to the andean orogeny in the tertiary
further south in southern patagonia the onset of the andean orogeny caused the magallanes basin to evolve from being an extensional back arc basin in the mesozoic to being a compressional foreland basin in the cenozoic
the andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity
the andean volcanism is a result of the subduction of the nazca plate and antarctic plate underneath the south american plate
the belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps
the volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style products and morphology
while some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes
despite being a typical location for calc alkalic and subduction volcanism the andean volcanic belt has a large range of volcano tectonic settings such as rift systems and extensional zones transpressional faults subduction of mid ocean ridges and seamount chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and magma ascent paths and different amount of crustal assimilations
the andes mountains host large ore and salt deposits and some of their eastern fold and thrust belt acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of hydrocarbons
in the forelands of the atacama desert some of the largest porphyry copper mineralizations occur making chile and peru the first and second largest exporters of copper in the world
porphyry copper in the western slopes of the andes has been generated by hydrothermal fluids during the cooling of plutons or volcanic systems
the porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of meteoric water
the dry climate in the central western andes has also led to the creation of extensive saltpeter deposits which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates
yet another result of the dry climate are the salars of atacama and uyuni the first one being the largest source of lithium today and the second the worlds largest reserve of the element
early mesozoic and neogene plutonism in bolivias cordillera central created the bolivian tin belt as well as the famous now depleted deposits of cerro rico de potos
the andes mountains initially inhabited by hunter gatherers experienced the development of agriculture and the rise of politically centralised civilizations which culminated in the establishment of the century long inca empire
this all changed in the th century when the spanish conquistadors colonized the mountains in advance of the mining economy
in the tide of anti imperialist nationalism the andes became the scene of a series of independence wars in the th century when rebel forces swept through the region to overthrow spanish colonial rule
since then many former spanish territories have become five independent andean states
the climate in the andes varies greatly depending on latitude altitude and proximity to the sea
temperature atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations
the southern section is rainy and cool the central section is dry
the northern andes are typically rainy and warm with an average temperature of in colombia
the climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances
rainforests exist just kilometres away from the snow covered peak of cotopaxi
the mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas
the snow line depends on the location
it is at between in the tropical ecuadorian colombian venezuelan and northern peruvian andes rising to in the drier mountains of southern peru south to northern chile south to about s before descending to on aconcagua at s at s at s and only in tierra del fuego at s from s several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level
the andes of chile and argentina can be divided into two climatic and glaciological zones the dry andes and the wet andes
since the dry andes extend from the latitudes of the atacama desert to the area of the maule river precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations
the line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time leaving a whole glacier in the ablation area or in the accumulation area
in the high andes of central chile and mendoza province rock glaciers are larger and more common than glaciers this is due to the high exposure to solar radiation
in these regions glaciers occur typically at higher altitudes than rock glaciers
the lowest active rock glacier occur at m asl in aconcagua
though precipitation increases with height there are semiarid conditions in the nearly highest mountains of the andes
this dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at s
the valley bottoms have no woods just dwarf scrub
the largest glaciers for example the plomo glacier and the horcones glaciers do not even reach in length and have only insignificant ice thickness
at glacial times however c
years ago the glaciers were over ten times longer
on the east side of this section of the mendozina andes they flowed down to and on the west side to about above sea level
the massifs of cerro aconcagua cerro tupungato and nevado juncal are tens of kilometres away from each other and were connected by a joint ice stream network
the andes dendritic glacier arms ie components of valley glaciers were up to long over thick and overspanned a vertical distance of
the climatic glacier snowline was lowered from to at glacial times
the andean region cuts across several natural and floristic regions due to its extension from caribbean venezuela to cold windy and wet cape horn passing through the hyperarid atacama desert
rainforests and tropical dry forests used to encircle much of the northern andes but are now greatly diminished especially in the choc and inter andean valleys of colombia
opposite of the humid andean slopes are the relatively dry andean slopes in most of western peru chile and argentina
along with several interandean valles they are typically dominated by deciduous woodland shrub and xeric vegetation reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless atacama desert
about species of vascular plants live in the andes with roughly half being endemic to the region surpassing the diversity of any other hotspot
the small tree cinchona pubescens a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria is found widely in the andes as far south as bolivia
other important crops that originated from the andes are tobacco and potatoes
the high altitude polylepis forests and woodlands are found in the andean areas of colombia ecuador peru bolivia and chile
these trees by locals referred to as queua yagual and other names can be found at altitudes of above sea level
it remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural or the result of clearing which began during the incan period
regardless in modern times the clearance has accelerated and the trees are now considered to be highly endangered with some believing that as little as of the original woodland remains
the andes are rich in fauna with almost species of which roughly are endemic to the region the andes are the most important region in the world for amphibians
the diversity of animals in the andes is high with almost species of mammals more than species of birds more than species of reptile and almost species of fish
the vicua and guanaco can be found living in the altiplano while the closely related domesticated llama and alpaca are widely kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool
the crepuscular chinchillas two threatened members of the rodent order inhabit the andes alpine regions
the andean condor the largest bird of its kind in the western hemisphere occurs throughout much of the andes but generally in very low densities
other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high andes include the huemul cougar foxes in the genus pseudalopex and for birds certain species of tinamous andean goose giant coot flamingos lesser rhea andean flicker diademed sandpiper plover miners sierra finches and diuca finches
lake titicaca hosts several endemics among them the highly endangered titicaca flightless grebe and titicaca water frog
a few species of hummingbirds notably some hillstars can be seen at altitudes above but far higher diversities can be found at lower altitudes especially in the humid andean forests growing on slopes in colombia ecuador peru bolivia and far northwestern argentina
these forest types which includes the yungas and parts of the choc are very rich in flora and fauna although few large mammals exist exceptions being the threatened mountain tapir spectacled bear and yellow tailed woolly monkey
birds of humid andean forests include mountain toucans quetzals and the andean cock of the rock while mixed species flocks dominated by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen in contrast to several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens tapaculos and antpittas
a number of species such as the royal cinclodes and white browed tit spinetail are associated with polylepis and consequently also threatened
the andes mountains form a north south axis of cultural influences
a long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the inca civilization and inca empire in the central andes during the th century
the incas formed this civilization through imperialistic militarism as well as careful and meticulous governmental management
the government sponsored the construction of aqueducts and roads in addition to preexisting installations
some of these constructions are still in existence today
devastated by european diseases and by civil war the incas were defeated in by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated and a small army of spaniards led by francisco pizarro
one of the few inca sites the spanish never found in their conquest was machu picchu which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the andes where they descend to the amazon
the main surviving languages of the andean peoples are those of the quechua and aymara language families

the cities of caracas valencia and maracay are in the venezuelan coastal range which is a debatable extension of the andes at the northern extremity of south america
cities and large towns are connected with asphalt paved roads while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads which may require a four wheel drive vehicle
the rough terrain has historically put the costs of building highways and railroads that cross the andes out of reach of most neighboring countries even with modern civil engineering practices
for example the main crossover of the andes between argentina and chile is still accomplished through the paso internacional los libertadores
only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected
much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft
however there is one railroad that connects chile with peru via the andes and there are others that make the same connection via southern bolivia
see railroad maps of that region
there are multiple highways in bolivia that cross the andes
some of these were built during a period of war between bolivia and paraguay in order to transport bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern bolivia and western paraguay
for decades chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the andes
however these claims were given up in about during the war of the pacific between chile and the allied bolivia and peru in a diplomatic deal to keep peru out of the war
the chilean army and chilean navy defeated the combined forces of bolivia and peru and chile took over bolivias only province on the pacific coast some land from peru that was returned to peru decades later
bolivia has been a completely landlocked country ever since
it mostly uses seaports in eastern argentina and uruguay for international trade because its diplomatic relations with chile have been suspended since
because of the tortuous terrain in places villages and towns in the mountains to which travel via motorized vehicles is of little use are still located in the high andes of chile bolivia peru and ecuador
locally the relatives of the camel the llama and the alpaca continue to carry out important uses as pack animals but this use has generally diminished in modern times
donkeys mules and horses are also useful
the ancient peoples of the andes such as the incas have practiced irrigation techniques for over years
because of the mountain slopes terracing has been a common practice
terracing however was only extensively employed after incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm
the potato holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop
maize was also an important crop for these people and was used for the production of chicha important to andean native people
currently tobacco cotton and coffee are the main export crops
coca despite eradication programmes in some countries remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating herbal tea and both controversially and illegally for the production of cocaine
in unirrigated land pasture is the most common type of land use
in the rainy season part of the rangeland is used for cropping
irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage
also by early sowing maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains
in addition it makes cropping in the dry season possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like onion and carrot
the andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the spanish conquest of south america
although andean amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals the mineralizations of the andes were first mined on a large scale after the spanish arrival
potos in present day bolivia and cerro de pasco in peru were among the principal mines of the spanish empire in the new world
ro de la plata and argentina derive their names from the silver of potos
currently mining in the andes of chile and peru places these countries as the first and second major producers of copper in the world
peru also contains the th largest goldmine in the world the yanacocha
the bolivian andes produce principally tin although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the economy of th century europe
there is a long history of mining in the andes from the spanish silver mines in potos in the th century to the vast current porphyry copper deposits of chuquicamata and escondida in chile and toquepala in peru
other metals including iron gold and tin in addition to non metallic resources are important
the andes also have a vast supply of lithium unmatched by any other region in the world
as they are home to argentina bolivia and chile which have the largest reserves in the world respectively this list contains some of the major peaks in the andes mountain range
the highest peak is aconcagua of argentina
ancylopoda is a group of browsing herbivorous mammals in the perissodactyla that show long curved and cleft claws
morphological evidence indicates the ancylopoda diverged from the tapirs rhinoceroses and horses after the brontotheria however earlier authorities such as osborn sometimes considered the ancylopoda to be outside perissodactyla or as was popular more recently to be related to brontotheriidae
macrotherium which is typically from the middle miocene of sansan in gers france may indicate a distinct genus
limb bones resembling those of macrotherium but relatively stouter have been described from the pliocene beds of attica and samos as ancylotherium
in the americas the names morothorium and moropus have been applied to similar bones in the belief that they indicated xenarthrans
macrotherium magnum must have been an animal of about nine feet in length
an anchor is a device normally made of metal used to secure a vessel to the bed of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to wind or current
the word derives from latin which itself comes from the greek
anchors can either be temporary or permanent
permanent anchors are used in the creation of a mooring and are rarely moved a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them
vessels carry one or more temporary anchors which may be of different designs and weights
a sea anchor is a drag device not in contact with the seabed used to minimise drift of a vessel relative to the water
a drogue is a drag device used to slow or help steer a vessel running before a storm in a following or overtaking sea or when crossing a bar in a breaking sea
anchors achieve holding power either by hooking into the seabed or weight or a combination of the two
permanent moorings use large masses resting on the seabed
semi permanent mooring anchors and large ships anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their weight while also hooking or embedding in the bottom
modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal flukes that hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed
the vessel is attached to the anchor by the rode
it can be made of rope chain or a combination of rope and chain
the ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope
holding ground is the area of sea floor that holds an anchor and thus the attached ship or boat
different types of anchor are designed to hold in different types of holding ground
some bottom materials hold better than others for instance hard sand holds well shell holds poorly
holding ground may be fouled with obstacles
an anchorage location may be chosen for its holding ground
in poor holding ground only the weight of an anchor matters in good holding ground it is able to dig in and the holding power can be significantly higher
the earliest anchors were probably rocks and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the bronze age
pre european maori waka used one or more hollowed stones tied with flax ropes as anchors
many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design
however using pure weight to resist the forces of a storm works well only as a permanent mooring a large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to a new location
the ancient greeks used baskets of stones large sacks filled with sand and wooden logs filled with lead
according to apollonius rhodius and stephen of byzantium anchors were formed of stone and athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood
such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom
iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth or flukes to fasten themselves into the bottom
this is the iconic anchor shape most familiar to non sailors
this form has been used since antiquity
the roman nemi ships of the st century ad used this form
the viking ladby ship used a fluked anchor of this type made of iron which would have had a wooden stock mounted perpendicular to the shank and flukes to make the flukes contact the bottom at a suitable angle to hook or penetrate
the admiralty pattern anchor or simply admiralty also known as a fisherman consists of a central shank with a ring or shackle for attaching the rode
at the other end of the shank there are two arms carrying the flukes while the stock is mounted to the shackle end at ninety degrees to the arms
when the anchor lands on the bottom it generally falls over with the arms parallel to the seabed
as a strain comes onto the rope the stock digs into the bottom canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom
the admiralty anchor is an entirely independent reinvention of a classical design as seen in one of the nemi ship anchors
this basic design remained unchanged for centuries with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late s and early s
since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts
when this happens the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re set
in the mid th century numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems as well as improve holding power including one armed mooring anchors
the most successful of these patent anchors the trotman anchor introduced a pivot at the centre of the crown where the arms join the shank allowing the idle upper arm to fold against the shank
when deployed the lower arm may fold against the shank tilting the tip of the fluke upwards so each fluke has a tripping palm at its base to hook on the bottom as the folded arm drags along the seabed which unfolds the downward oriented arm until the tip of the fluke can engage the bottom
handling and storage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures
once the anchor is hauled up to the hawsepipe the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the cathead
the crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail
this is known as catting and fishing the anchor
before dropping the anchor the fishing process is reversed and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead
the stockless anchor patented in england in represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries
although their holding power to weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption
in contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes and the flukes against the hull
while there are numerous variations stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank
cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms projections that drag on the bottom forcing the main flukes to dig in
until the mid th century anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled down versions of admiralty anchors or simple grapnels
as new designs with greater holding power to weight ratios were sought a great variety of anchor designs has emerged
many of these designs are still under patent and other types are best known by their original trademarked names
a traditional design the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines also known as a drag
it has a benefit in that no matter how it reaches the bottom one or more tines are aimed to set
in coral or rock it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure but may be more difficult to retrieve
a grapnel is often quite light and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard
its weight also makes it relatively easy to move and carry however its shape is generally not compact and it may be awkward to stow unless a collapsing model is used
grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand clay or mud
it is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom preventing it from digging in
on the other hand it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that without a trip line from the crown it is impossible to retrieve
designed by yacht designer l
francis herreshoff this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms
the novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage
in use it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor
originally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes this design consists of two plough like blades mounted to a shank with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor
many manufacturers produce a plough type anchor so named after its resemblance to an agricultural plough
all such anchors are copied from the original cqr a design patented in the uk by mathematician geoffrey ingram taylor
plough anchors stow conveniently in a roller at the bow and have been popular with cruising sailors and private boaters
ploughs can be moderately good in all types of seafloor though not exceptional in any
contrary to popular belief the cqrs hinged shank is not to allow the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out but actually to prevent the shanks weight from disrupting the flukes orientation while setting
the hinge can wear out and may trap a sailors fingers
some later plough anchors have a rigid shank such as the lewmars delta
a plough anchor has a fundamental flaw like its namesake the agricultural plough it digs in but then tends to break out back to the surface
plough anchors sometimes have difficulty setting at all and instead skip across the seafloor
by contrast modern efficient anchors tend to be scoop types that dig ever deeper
the delta anchor was derived from the cqr
it was patented by philip mccarron james stewart and gordon lyall of british marine manufacturer simpson lawrence ltd in
it was designed as an advance over the anchors used for floating systems such as oil rigs
it retains the weighted tip of the cqr but has a much higher fluke area to weight ratio than its predecessor
the designers also eliminated the sometimes troublesome hinge
it is a plough anchor with a rigid arched shank
it is described as self launching because it can be dropped from a bow roller simply by paying out the rode without manual assistance
this is an oft copied design with the european brake and australian sarca excel being two of the more notable ones
although it is a plough type anchor it sets and holds reasonably well in hard bottoms
american richard danforth invented the danforth anchor in the s for use aboard landing craft
it uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached
the stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom
tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed
the design is a burying variety and once well set can develop high resistance
its lightweight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke style anchor
a danforth does not usually penetrate or hold in gravel or weeds
in boulders and coral it may hold by acting as a hook
if there is much current or if the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor it may kite or skate over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing
the fob hp anchor designed in brittany in the s is a danforth variant designed to give increased holding through its use of rounded flukes setting at a angle
the fortress is an american aluminum alloy danforth variant that can be disassembled for storage and it features an adjustable and shank fluke angle to improve holding capability in common sea bottoms such as hard sand and soft mud
this anchor performed well in a us naval sea systems command test and in an august holding power test that was conducted in the soft mud bottoms of the chesapeake bay
this claw shaped anchor was designed by peter bruce from scotland in the s
bruce gained his early reputation from the production of large scale commercial anchors for ships and fixed installations such as oil rigs
it was later scaled down for small boats and copies of this popular design abound
the bruce and its copies known generically as claw type anchors have been adopted on smaller boats but they are most effective in larger sizes
claw anchors are quite popular on charter fleets as they have a high chance to set on the first try in many bottoms
they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force
bruce anchors can have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass
they offer a fairly low holding power to weight ratio and generally have to be oversized to compete with newer types
three time circumnavigator german rolf kaczirek invented the bgel anker in the s
kaczirek wanted an anchor that was self righting without necessitating a ballasted tip
instead he added a roll bar and switched out the plough share for a flat blade design
as none of the innovations of this anchor were patented copies of it abound
alain poiraud of france introduced the scoop type anchor in
similar in design to the bgel anchor poirauds design features a concave fluke shaped like the blade of a shovel with a shank attached parallel to the fluke and the load applied toward the digging end
it is designed to dig into the bottom like a shovel and dig deeper as more pressure is applied
the common challenge with all the scoop type anchors is that they set so well they can be difficult to weigh
these are used where the vessel is permanently or semi permanently sited for example in the case of lightvessels or channel marker buoys
the anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers including the most severe storm but needs to be lifted only occasionally at most for example only if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance
an alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances especially if the anchor need never be lifted at all may be to use a pile that is driven into the seabed
permanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form
a slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose as would any dense object of appropriate weight
modern moorings may be anchored by augers which look and act like oversized screws drilled into the seabed or by barbed metal beams pounded in like pilings or by a variety of other non mass means of getting a grip on the bottom
one method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel so no matter which direction the vessel moves one or more anchors are aligned to resist the force
the mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand
it was invented by robert stevenson for use by an ton converted fishing boat pharos which was used as a lightvessel between and near to bell rock whilst the lighthouse was being constructed
it was equipped with a ton example
it is shaped like an inverted mushroom the head becoming buried in the silt
a counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried
a mushroom anchor normally sinks in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material thus greatly increasing its holding power
these anchors are suitable only for a silt or mud bottom since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack
the holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight until it becomes buried when it can be as much as ten times its weight
they are available in sizes from about kg up to several tons
a deadweight is an anchor that relies solely on being a heavy weight
it is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain
its holding power is defined by its weight underwater regardless of the type of seabed although suction can increase this if it becomes buried
consequently deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable for example in rock gravel or coarse sand
an advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does drag it continues to provide its original holding force
the disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor
auger anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings floating docks fish farms etc
these anchors which have one or more slightly pitched self drilling threads must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool so require access to the bottom either at low tide or by use of a diver
hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment
weight for weight augers have a higher holding than other permanent designs and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed although difficult to set in extremely soft mud
there is a need in the oil and gas industry to resist large anchoring forces when laying pipelines and for drilling vessels
these anchors are installed and removed using a support tug and pennant pendant wire
some examples are the stevin range supplied by vrijhof ankers
large plate anchors such as the stevmanta are used for permanent moorings
the elements of anchoring gear include the anchor the cable the method of attaching the two together the method of attaching the cable to the ship charts and a method of learning the depth of the water
vessels may carry a number of anchors bower anchors are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel
a kedge anchor is a light anchor used for warping an anchor also known as kedging or more commonly on yachts for mooring quickly or in benign conditions
a stream anchor which is usually heavier than a kedge anchor can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted such as rivers and channels
charts are vital to good anchoring
knowing the location of potential dangers as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook
one can get by without referring to charts but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them
the anchor rode that connects the anchor to the vessel is usually made up of chain rope or a combination of those
large ships use only chain rode
smaller craft might use a rope chain combination or an all chain rode
all rodes should have some chain chain is heavy but it resists abrasion from coral sharp rocks or shellfish beds whereas a rope warp is susceptible to abrasion and can fail in a short time when stretched against an abrasive surface
the weight of the chain also helps keep the direction of pull on the anchor closer to horizontal which improves holding and absorbs part of snubbing loads
where weight is not an issue a heavier chain provides better holding by forming a catenary curve through the water and resting as much of its length on the bottom as would not be lifted by tension of the mooring load
any changes to the tension are accommodated by additional chain bing lifted or settling on the bottom and this absorbs shock loads until the chain is straight at which point the full load is taken by the anchor
additional dissipation of shock loads can be achieved by fitting a snubber between the chain and a bollard or cleat on deck
this also reduces shock loads on the deck fittings and the vessel usually lies more comfortably and quietly
being strong and elastic nylon rope is the most suitable as an anchor rode
polyester is stronger but less elastic than nylon
both materials sink so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water
neither breaks down quickly in sunlight
elasticity helps absorb shock loading but causes faster abrasive wear when the rope stretches over an abrasive surface like a coral bottom or a poorly designed chock
polypropylene is not suited to rodes because it floats and is much weaker than nylon being barely stronger than natural fibres
some grades of polypropylene break down in sunlight and become hard weak and unpleasant to handle
natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb a lot of water are relatively weak and rot although they do give good handling grip and are often relatively cheap
ropes that have little or no elasticity are not suitable as anchor rodes
elasticity is partly a function of the fibre material and partly of the rope structure
all anchors should have chain at least equal to the boats length
some skippers prefer an all chain warp for greater security on coral or sharp edged rock bottoms
the chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice
the shackle pin should be securely wired or moused
either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles galvanised steel being the stronger of the two
some skippers prefer to add a swivel to the rode
there is a school of thought that says these should not be connected to the anchor itself but should be somewhere in the chain
however most skippers connect the swivel directly to the anchor
scope is the ratio of the depth of the water measured from the highest point to the seabed making allowance for the highest expected tide
the function of this ratio is to ensure that the pull on the anchor is unlikely to break it out of the bottom if it is embedded or lift it off a hard bottom either of which is likely to result in the anchor dragging
a large scope induces a load that is nearly horizontal
in moderate conditions the ratio of rode to water depth should be where there is sufficient swing room a greater scope is always better
in rougher conditions it should be up to twice this with the extra length giving more stretch and a smaller angle to the bottom to resist the anchor breaking out
for example if the water is deep and the anchor roller is above the water then the depth is meters
the amount of rode to let our in moderate conditions is thus meters
when using a rope rode there is a simple way to estimate the scope the ratio of bow height of the rode to length of rode above the water while lying back hard on the anchor is the same or less than the scope ratio
the basis for this is simple geometry the ratio between two sides of a triangle stays the same regardless of the size of the triangle as long as the angles do not change
generally the rode should be between and times the depth to the seabed giving a scope of or the larger the number the shallower the angle is between the cable and the seafloor and the less upwards force is acting on the anchor
a scope gives the greatest holding power but also allows for much more drifting due to the longer amount of cable paid out
anchoring with sufficient scope and or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed
this is particularly important for light modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom where scopes of to are common whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use a scope of or less
some modern anchors such as the ultra holds with a scope of but unless the anchorage is crowded a longer scope always reduces shock stresses
the basic anchoring consists of determining the location dropping the anchor laying out the scope setting the hook and assessing where the vessel ends up
the ship seeks a location that is sufficiently protected has suitable holding ground enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing
the location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current whichever is stronger
as the chosen spot is approached the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back
the anchor should initially be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom
the vessel should continue to drift back and the cable should be veered out under control so it is relatively straight
once the desired scope is laid out the vessel should be gently forced astern usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail
a hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts indicating the anchor is dragging or a smooth tension indicative of digging in
as the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set
if the anchor continues to drag or sets after having dragged too far it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position lowering a concentrated heavy weight down the anchor line rope or chain directly in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchor
if the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag
in light conditions a kellet reduces the swing of the vessel considerably
in heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective
known as an anchor chum weight or angel in the uk
using two anchors set approximately apart or wider angles up to from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds
to set anchors in this way first one anchor is set in the normal fashion
then taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back a second anchor is set approximately a half scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind
after this second anchor is set the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable
this moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessels swing to a narrower oval
care should be taken that other vessels do not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range
in the bow and stern technique an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern which can severely limit a vessels swing range and also align it to steady wind current or wave conditions
one method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally then drop back to the limit of the bow cable to lower a stern anchor
by taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set
after both anchors are set tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel
similar to the above a bahamian moor is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel but allows it to swing to a current
one of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows the first anchor is set normally and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable
a second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable and is dropped and set
a swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable and the vessel connected to that
the vessel now swings in the middle of two anchors which is acceptable in strong reversing currents but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors as they are not aligned for this load
also known as tandem anchoring in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other on the same rode
with the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft most this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in ultimate storm circumstances
it does not limit swinging range and might not be suitable in some circumstances
there are complications and the technique requires careful preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor
kedging or warping is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor
in yachts a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main or bower anchors and usually stowed aft
every yacht should carry at least two anchors the main or bower anchor and a second lighter kedge anchor
it is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored such as in a narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area
kedge anchors are sometimes used to recover vessels that have run aground
for ships a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ships boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream
historically it was of particular relevance to sailing warships that used them to outmaneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined shoal water to place it in a more desirable position provided she had enough manpower
club hauling is an archaic technique
when a vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow
this is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway
as the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack
the anchor is then normally cut away
since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor at this point the anchor chain is up and down in naval parlance
if necessary motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it
anchors are sometimes fitted with a trip line attached to the crown by which they can be unhooked from rocks coral chain or other underwater hazards
the term aweigh describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom
this is linked to the term to weigh anchor meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed allowing the ship or boat to move
an anchor is described as aweigh when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be stowed
aweigh should not be confused with under way which describes a vessel that is not moored to a dock or anchored whether or not the vessel is moving through the water
aweigh is also often confused with away which is incorrect
an anchor frequently appears on the flags and coats of arms of institutions involved with the sea both naval and commercial as well as of port cities and seacoast regions and provinces in various countries
there also exists in heraldry the anchored cross or mariners cross a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor
the symbol can be used to signify fresh start or hope
the new testament refers to the christians hope as an anchor of the soul
the mariners cross is also referred to as st
clements cross in reference to the way this saint was killed
anchored crosses are occasionally a feature of coats of arms in which context they are referred to by the heraldic terms anchry or ancre
in the delta gamma fraternity adopted the anchor as its badge to signify hope
the unicode anchor is represented by
anbar also known by its original ancient name peroz shapur was an ancient and medieval town in central iraq
it played a role in the roman persian wars of the rd th centuries and briefly became the capital of the abbasid caliphate before the founding of baghdad in
it remained a moderately prosperous town through the th century but quickly declined thereafter
as a local administrative centre it survived until the th century but was later abandoned
its ruins are near modern fallujah
the city gives its name to the al anbar governorate
the city is located on the left bank of the middle euphrates at the junction with the nahr isa canal the first of the navigable canals that link the euphrates to the river tigris to the east
the origins of the city are unknown but ancient perhaps dating to the babylonian era and even earlier the local artificial mound of tell aswad dates to
the town was originally known as misiche mesiche or massice
as a major crossing point of the euphrates and occupying the northernmost point of the complex irrigation network of the sawad the town was of considerable strategic significance
as the western gate to central mesopotamia it was fortified by the sasanian ruler shapur i to shield his capital ctesiphon from the roman empire
after his decisive defeat of the roman emperor gordian iii at the battle of misiche in shapur renamed the town to peroz shapur
it became known as pirisapora or bersabora to the greeks and romans
the city was fortified by a double wall possibly through the use of roman prisoner labour it was sacked and burned after an agreement with its garrison in march by the roman emperor julian during his invasion of the sasanian empire
it was rebuilt by shapur ii
by it is attested as a bishopric both for the church of the east and for the syriac orthodox church
the towns garrison was persian but it also contained sizeable arab and jewish populations
anbar was adjacent or identical to the babylonian jewish center of nehardea and lies a short distance from the present day town of fallujah formerly the babylonian jewish center of pumbedita
the city fell to the rashidun caliphate in july after a fiercely fought siege
when ali ibn abi talib passed through the city he was warmly welcomed by ninety thousand jews who then lived there and he received them with great friendliness
the arabs retained the name for the surrounding district but the town itself became known as anbar from the granaries in its citadel a name that had appeared already during the th century
according to baladhuri the third mosque to be built in iraq was erected in the city by sad ibn abi waqqas
ibn abi waqqas initially considered anbar as a candidate for the location of one of the first muslim garrison towns but the fever and fleas endemic in the area persuaded him otherwise
according to medieval arabic sources most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to found the city of hdatta south of mosul
the famous governor al hajjaj ibn yusuf cleared the canals of the city
abul abbas as saffah the founder of the abbasid caliphate made it his capital in constructing a new town half a farsakh to the north for his khurasani troops
there he died and was buried at the palace he had built
his successor al mansur remained in the city until the founding of baghdad in
the abbasids also dug the great nahr isa canal to the south of the city which carried water and commerce east to baghdad
the nahr al saqlawiyya or nahr al qarma canal which branches off from the euphrates to the west of the city is sometimes erroneously held to be the nahr isa but it is more likely that it is to be identified with the pre islamic nahr al rufayl
it continued to be a place of much importance throughout the abbasid period
caliph harun al rashid stayed at the town in and in
the towns prosperity was founded on agricultural activities but also on trade between iraq and syria
the town was still prosperous in the early th century but the decline of abbasid authority during the later th century exposed it to bedouin attacks in and
in the qarmatians under abu tahir al jannabi sacked the city during their invasion of iraq and the devastation was compounded by another bedouin attack two years later
the towns decline accelerated after that while the early th century geographer istakhri still calls the town modest but populous with the ruins of the buildings of as saffah still visible ibn hawqal and al maqdisi who wrote a generation later attest to its decline and the diminution of its population
the town was sacked again in by the mongols under kerboka
the ilkhanids retained anbar as an administrative centre a role it retained until the first half of the th century the ilkhanid minister shams al din juvayni had a canal dug from the city to najaf and the city was surrounded by a wall of sun dried bricks
anbar used to host an assyrian community from the fifth century the town was the seat of a bishopric of the church of the east
the names of fourteen of its bishops of the period are known three of whom became chaldean patriarchs of babylon
anbar is listed by the catholic church as a titular see of the chaldean catholic church established as titular bishopric in
it is now entirely deserted occupied only by mounds of ruins whose great number indicate the citys former importance
its ruins are northwest of fallujah with a circumference of some
the remains include traces of the late medieval wall a square fortification and the early islamic mosque
anazarbus also known as justinopolis was an ancient cilician city
under the late roman empire it was the capital of cilicia secunda
roman emperor justinian i rebuilt the city in after a strong earthquake hit it
it was destroyed in by the forces of the mamluk empire after their conquest of cilician armenia
it was situated in anatolia in modern turkey in the present ukurova about km west of the main stream of the present ceyhan river and near its tributary the sempas su
a lofty isolated ridge formed its acropolis
though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre roman the sudas identification of it with cyinda famous as a treasure city in the wars of eumenes of cardia cannot be accepted in the face of strabos express location of cyinda in western cilicia
according to the suda the original name of the place was cyinda or kyinda or quinda and that it was next called diocaesarea
a city in cilicia called kundu rebelled against the assyrian king esarhaddon in th century bc but its unclear if there is a connection
at least its known a city called anazarbus and anazarba and anazarbon situated on the river pyramus existed in the first century bc and was a part of the small client kingdom of tarcondimotus i until it was annexed by rome
how the city obtained the name is a matter of conjecture
according to stephanus of byzantium after the city was destroyed by an earthquake the emperor nerva sent thither one anazarbus a man of senatorial rank who rebuilt the city and gave to it his own name
this account cannot be accurate as valesius remarks for it was called anazarbus in plinys time
dioscorides is called a native of anazarbus but the period of dioscorides is not certain
it was also the home of the poet oppian
its later name was caesarea ad anazarbum and there are many medals of the place in which it is both named anazarbus and caesarea at or under anazarbus
on the division of cilicia it became the chief place of the roman province of cilicia secunda with the title of metropolis
early in the sixth century in the reign of eastern roman emperor justin i it was named justinopolis or ioustinoupolis
the city suffered from an earthquake in and was rebuilt by justinian i and renamed justinianopolis or ioustinianoupolis but the old name persisted and when thoros i king of lesser armenia made it his capital early in the th century it was known as anazarva
its great natural strength and situation not far from the mouth of the sis pass and near the great road which debouched from the cilician gates made anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the eastern roman empire and the early muslim invaders
it had been rebuilt by harun al rashid in refortified at great expense by the hamdanid sayf al dawla and again destroyed in by nikephoros ii phokas
in the th century it was again a major fortress comparable to tarsos and marash and belonged to the realm of philaretos brachamios before it was captured around by the seljuk turks
in late or early it was captured by the armies of the first crusade and after the conquest of antioch it was incorporated into bohemond of tarantos principality of antioch
the site briefly exchanged hands between the byzantine empire and armenians until it was formally part of the armenian kingdom of cilicia
anazarbus was one of a chain of armenian fortifications stretching through cilicia
the castle of sis lies to the north while tumlu castle and yilankale are to the south and the fortresses of amouda and sarvandikar are to the east
the mamluk empire of egypt finally destroyed the city in
the crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop
most of the remaining fortifications including the curtain walls massive horseshoe shaped towers undercrofts cisterns and free standing structures date from the armenian periods of occupation which began with the arrival of the rubenid baron toros i
within the fortress are two armenian chapels and the magnificent three aisle church built by toros i to celebrate his conquests
the church was once surrounded by a continuous well executed dedicatory inscription in armenian
the present wall of the lower city is of late construction
it encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine triumphal arch the colonnades of two streets a gymnasium etc
a stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south
the remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting including roads and ditches hewn in the rock
there are no notable structures in the upper town
for picturesqueness the site is not equaled in cilicia and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine aqueducts to their sources
a necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations
a modest turkish farming village lies to the southwest of the ancient city
a small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee
also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field
a visit in december showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed
only small isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood
a powerful earthquake that struck the area in is thought to be responsible for the destruction
in excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double lane road of the ancient world meters wide and meters long also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse
in archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess hygieia and the god eros
the statue is thought to date to the third or fourth century bc anazarbus was the capital and so also from the metropolitan see of the late roman province of cilicia secunda
in the th century one of the bishops of anazarbus was athanasius a consistent expounder of the theology of arius
his theological opponent athanasius of alexandria in de synodis refers to anazarbus as
maximin of anazarbus attended the council of chalcedon
a th century notitia episcopatuum indicates that it had as suffragan sees epiphania alexandria minor irenopolis flavias castabala and aegeae
rhosus was also subject to anazarbus but after the th century was made exempt and mopsuestia was raised to the rank of autocephalous metropolitan see though without suffragans
the titular archbishopric was revived in the th century as a see of the latin catholic church anazarbus
it is vacant having had the following incumbents generally of the highest rank with an episcopal exception in the th century an armenian catholic titular bishopric of anazarbus was established
an anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase typically using all the original letters exactly once
for example the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode
the original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram
any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram
someone who creates anagrams may be called an anagrammatist and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject
anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject
they may be a parody a criticism or satire
for example an anagram may also be a synonym of the original word
for example an anagram that has a meaning opposed to that of the original word or phrase is called an antigram
for example they can change part of speech such as the adjective silent to the verb listen
anagrams itself can be anagrammatized as ars magna
anagrams can be traced back to the time of the ancient greeks and were used to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names
they were popular throughout europe during the middle ages for example with the poet and composer guillaume de machaut
they are said to date back at least to the greek poet lycophron in the third century bce but this relies on an account of lycophron given by john tzetzes in the th century
in the talmudic and midrashic literature anagrams were used to interpret the hebrew bible notably by eleazar of modiim
later kabbalists took this up with enthusiasm calling anagrams temurah
anagrams in latin were considered witty over many centuries
est vir qui adest explained below was cited as the example in samuel johnsons a dictionary of the english language
they became hugely popular in the early modern period especially in germany
any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question
in particular spelling in english only slowly became fixed
there were attempts to regulate anagram formation an important one in english being that of george puttenhams of the anagram or posy transposed in the art of english poesie
as a literary game when latin was the common property of the literate latin anagrams were prominent
two examples are the change of ave maria gratia plena dominus tecum into virgo serena pia munda et immaculata and the anagrammatic answer to pilates question quid est veritas namely est vir qui adest
the origins of these are not documented
latin continued to influence letter values
there was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be perfect if the letters were all used once but allowing for these interchanges
this can be seen in a popular latin anagram against the jesuits societas jesu turned into vitiosa seces
puttenham in the time of elizabeth i wished to start from elissabet anglorum regina to obtain multa regnabis ense gloria he explains carefully that h is a note of aspiration only and no letter and that z in greek or hebrew is a mere ss
the rules were not completely fixed in the th century
william camden in his remains commented singling out some letters k w and z not found in the classical roman alphabet when it comes to the th century and anagrams in english or other languages there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest
the lawyer thomas egerton was praised through the anagram gestat honorem the physician george ent took the anagrammatic motto genio surget which requires his first name as georgius
james is courtiers discovered in james stuart a just master and converted charles james stuart into claims arthurs seat
walter quin tutor to the future charles i worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father james
a notorious murder scandal the overbury case threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by simonds dewes francis howard became car findes a whore with the letters e hardly counted and the victim thomas overbury as thomas overburie was written as o o a busie murther with a v counted as u
william drummond of hawthornden in an essay on the character of a perfect anagram tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions and letter omissions
william camden provided a definition of anagrammatisme as a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters as his elements and a new connection of it by artificial transposition without addition subtraction or change of any letter into different words making some perfect sense appliable to the person named
dryden in macflecknoe disdainfully called the pastime the torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways
eleanor audeley wife of sir john davies is said to have been brought before the high commission in for extravagances stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to reveale o daniel and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by sir john lambe the dean of the arches dame eleanor davies never soe mad a ladie
an example from france was a flattering anagram for cardinal richelieu comparing him to hercules or at least one of his hands where armand de richelieu became ardue main dhercule
examples from the th century are the transposition of horatio nelson into honor est a nilo and of florence nightingale into flit on cheering angel
the victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by the mathematician augustus de morgan using his own name as an example great gun do us a sum is attributed to his son william de morgan but a family friend john thomas graves was prolific and a manuscript with over has been preserved
with the advent of surrealism as a poetic movement anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the baroque period
the german poet unica zrn who made extensive use of anagram techniques came to regard obsession with anagrams as a dangerous fever because it created isolation of the author
the surrealist leader andr breton coined the anagram avida dollars for salvador dal to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism
while anagramming is certainly a recreation first there are ways in which anagrams are put to use and these can be more serious or at least not quite frivolous and formless
for example psychologists use anagram oriented tests often called anagram solution tasks to assess the implicit memory of young adults and adults alike
natural philosophers of the th century transposed their discoveries into latin anagrams to establish their priority
in this way they laid claim to new discoveries before their results were ready for publication
galileo used for for discovering the rings of saturn in
galileo announced his discovery that venus had phases like the moon in the form that is when rearranged
in both cases johannes kepler had solved the anagrams incorrectly assuming they were talking about the moons of mars and a red spot on jupiter respectively
by coincidence he turned out to be right about the actual objects existing
in christiaan huygens using a better telescope than those available to galileo figured that galileos earlier observations of saturn actually meant it had a ring and like galileo had published an anagram
upon confirming his observations three years later he revealed it to mean
when robert hooke discovered hookes law in he first published it in anagram form for
anagrams are connected to pseudonyms by the fact that they may conceal or reveal or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity
for example jim morrison used an anagram of his name in the doors song la woman calling himself mr mojo risin
the use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names as happened in the th century when edward cave wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the house of commons
in a genre such as farce or parody anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect
pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names thus calvinus becomes alcuinus or franois rabelais alcofribas nasier
the name voltaire of franois marie arouet fits this pattern and is allowed to be an anagram of arouet lj ratio has been estimated to range from in small dark clouds up to in the dense core of the orion molecular cloud complex
although a total of total production routes have been proposed the principal formation mechanism for interstellar is the reaction the rate constant k of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment with a value of at k
the rate constant was calculated from the formula
for the primary formation reaction and
assuming an abundance of and an electron abundance of typical of molecular clouds the formation will proceed at a rate of in a molecular cloud of total density
all other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between and orders of magnitude smaller making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant
as an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play the reaction has a rate constant of assuming densities of and ratio of this reaction proceeds at a rate of more than orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above
there are total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of
of these were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among c n and o compounds
a review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms with rate constants of and respectively
the above equations run at a rate of and respectively
these calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of and total densities of n typical of cold dense molecular clouds
clearly between these two primary reactions equation is the dominant destruction reaction with a rate times faster than equation
this is due to the relatively high abundance of
radio observations of from the effelsberg m radio telescope reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components a background ridge and an unresolved core
the background corresponds well with the locations previously detected co
the m chilbolton telescope in england detected radio signatures of ammonia in h ii regions hnho masers h h objects and other objects associated with star formation
a comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds
microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including w orion a w w and five sources in the galactic centre
the high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high density regions are common in the galaxy
vla observations of in seven regions with high velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than pc in l s and cepheus a
three individual condensations were detected in cepheus a one of them with a highly elongated shape
they may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region
extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the vla in ic
the hot gas has temperatures above k which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in co
was also monitored by vla toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact hii regions g g g and g
based upon temperature and density diagnostics it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact hii region
absorption at micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the becklin neugebauer object and probably in ngc ir as well
this detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines
a spectrum of the disk of jupiter was obtained from the kuiper airborne observatory covering the to cm spectral range
analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze
a total of dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of dense cores by using the rotating inversion line of nh
in general the cores are not spherically shaped with aspect ratios ranging from to it is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars
ammonia has been detected in the draco nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds which are associated with the high latitude galactic infrared cirrus
the finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the population i metallicity b type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk
by balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission it is possible to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density
moreover since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a level system at low temperatures this calculation is fairly simple
this premise can be applied to dark clouds regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation
detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow linesindicative not only of low temperatures but also of a low level of inner cloud turbulence
line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous co observations
the ammonia observations were consistent with co measurements of rotation temperatures of k
with this densities can be determined and have been calculated to range between and cm in dark clouds
mapping of gives typical clouds sizes of pc and masses near solar mass
these cold dense cores are the sites of future star formation
ultra compact hii regions are among the best tracers of high mass star formation
the dense material surrounding uchii regions is likely primarily molecular
since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material
since this molecular material can be spatially resolved it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources temperatures masses and sizes of the regions
doppler shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars
ammonia has been detected in external galaxies and by simultaneously measuring several lines it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies
line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc
this picture is consistent with the picture within our milky way galaxyhot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc
amethyst is a violet variety of quartz
the name comes from the koine greek amethystos from a not and intoxicate a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness
ancient greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication
amethyst a semiprecious stone is often used in jewelry
amethyst is a purple variety of quartz and owes its violet color to irradiation impurities of iron and in some cases other transition metals and the presence of other trace elements which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions
the irradiation causes the iron fe atoms that replace si in the lattice to lose an electron and form a color center
amethyst is a three dimensional network of tetrahedra where the silicon atoms are in the center and are surrounded by four oxygen atoms located at the vertices of a tetrahedron
this structure is quite rigid and results in quartzs hardness and resistance to weathering
the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz thus making it suitable for use in jewelry
amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light lavender or pale violet to a deep purple
amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues red and blue
high quality amethyst can be found in siberia sri lanka brazil uruguay and the far east
the ideal grade called deep siberian has a primary purple hue of around with blue and red secondary hues
rose de france is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple reminiscent of a lavender lilac shade
these pale colors were once considered undesirable but have recently become popular due to intensive marketing
green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst this is a misnomer and not an appropriate name for the material as the proper terminology is prasiolite
other names for green quartz are vermarine or lime citrine
amethyst frequently shows color zoning with the most intense color typically found at the crystal terminations
it is the most prized variety of quartz
one of a gem cutters tasks is to make a finished product with even color
sometimes only a thin layer of a natural uncut amethyst is violet colored or the color is very uneven
the uncut gem may have only a small portion that is suitable for faceting
the color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron for silicon in the structure in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius and to a certain extent the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low
natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet but when heated turns yellow orange yellow brown or dark brownish and may resemble citrine but loses its dichroism unlike genuine citrine
when partially heated amethyst can result in ametrine
amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation
it does not fluoresce under either short wave or long wave uv light
amethyst is found in many locations around the world
between and the greatest production was from marab and pau darco par and the paran basin rio grande do sul brazil sandoval santa cruz bolivia artigas uruguay kalomo zambia and thunder bay ontario
lesser amounts are found in many other locations in africa brazil spain argentina russia afghanistan south korea mexico and the united states
is produced in abundance in the state of rio grande do sul in brazil where it occurs in large geodes within volcanic rocks
many of the hollow agates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior
artigas uruguay and neighboring brazilian state rio grande do sul are large world producers with lesser quantities mined in minas gerais and bahia states
the largest amethyst geode found to date was the empress of uruguay found in artigas uruguay in
it stands at a height of meters lays open along its length and weighs tons
amethyst is also found and mined in south korea
the large opencast amethyst vein at maissau lower austria was historically important but is no longer included among significant producers
much fine amethyst comes from russia especially near mursinka in the ekaterinburg district where it occurs in drusy cavities in granitic rocks
amethyst was historically mined in many localities in south india though these are no longer significant producers
one of the largest global amethyst producers is zambia in southern africa with an annual production around tons
amethyst occurs at many localities in the united states
the most important production is at four peaks gila and maricopa counties arizona and jacksons crossroads wilkes county georgia
smaller occurrences have been reported in the red feather lakes near fort collins colorado amethyst mountain texas yellowstone national park delaware county pennsylvania haywood county north carolina deer hill and stow maine and in the lake superior region of minnesota wisconsin and michigan
amethyst is relatively common in the canadian provinces of ontario and nova scotia
the largest amethyst mine in north america is located in thunder bay ontario
amethyst is the official state gemstone of south carolina
several south carolina amethysts are on display at the smithsonian museum of natural history
amethyst was used as a gemstone by the ancient egyptians and was largely employed in antiquity for intaglio engraved gems
the ancient greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication while medieval european soldiers wore amethyst amulets as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal people and keep them cool headed
beads of amethyst were found in anglo saxon graves in england
anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an amethyst an allusion to the description of the apostles as not drunk at pentecost in acts
a large geode or amethyst grotto from near santa cruz in southern brazil was presented at a exhibition in dsseldorf germany
the meaning of amethyst varies from time to time and culture which is why amethyst has different meanings in feng shui and focuses on increasing wealth
in ancient china it was also used as a powerful tool to remove negative energies and drive away the hazards of daily life
synthetic amethyst is produced by a synthesis method called hydrothermal growth which grows the crystals inside a high pressure autoclave
synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst
its chemical and physical properties are the same as those of natural amethyst and it cannot be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing
one test based on brazil law twinning can be used to identify most synthetic amethyst rather easily
synthesizing twinned amethyst is possible but this type is not available in large quantities in the market
treated amethyst is produced by gamma ray x ray or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz which has been first doped with ferric impurities
exposure to heat partially cancels the irradiation effects and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green
much of the citrine cairngorm or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely burnt amethyst
the greek word amethystos may be translated as not drunken from greek a not intoxicated
amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness which is why wine goblets were often carved from it
in his poem lamethyste ou les amours de bacchus et damethyste the french poet rmy belleau invented a myth in which bacchus the god of intoxication of wine and grapes was pursuing a maiden named amethyste who refused his affections
amethyste prayed to the gods to remain chaste a prayer which the chaste goddess diana answered transforming her into a white stone
humbled by amethystes desire to remain chaste bacchus poured wine over the stone as an offering dyeing the crystals purple
variations of the story include that dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath
the mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman amethystos who was on her way to pay tribute to artemis
her life was spared by artemis who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws
dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue
the gods tears then stained the quartz purple
this myth and its variations are not found in classical sources
however the goddess rhea does present dionysus with an amethyst stone to preserve the wine drinkers sanity in historical text
tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the buddha and make prayer beads from it
amethyst is considered the birthstone of february
in the middle ages it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate english regalia
in the old world amethyst was considered one of the cardinal gems in that it was one of the five gemstones considered precious above all others until large deposits were found in brazil
until the th century amethyst was included in the cardinal or most valuable gemstones but since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as brazil it has lost most of its value
it is now considered a semiprecious stone
collectors look for depth of color possibly with red flashes if cut conventionally
as amethyst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by carat weight
this is different from most gemstones since the carat weight typically exponentially increases the value of the stone
the biggest factor in the value of amethyst is the color displayed
the highest grade amethyst is exceptionally rare
when one is found its value is dependent on the demand of collectors
the highest grade sapphires or rubies are still orders of magnitude more expensive than amethyst
the most suitable setting for gem amethyst is a prong or a bezel setting
the channel method must be used with caution
amethyst has a good hardness and handling it with proper care will prevent any damage to the stone
amethyst is sensitive to strong heat and may lose or change its colour when exposed to prolonged heat or light
polishing the stone or cleaning it by ultrasonic or steamer must be done with caution

albertosaurus is a genus of large tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in northwestern north america during the early to middle maastrichtian age of the late cretaceous period about million years ago
the type species a
sarcophagus was apparently restricted in range to the modern day canadian province of alberta after which the genus is named although an indeterminate species has been discovered in the corral de enmedio and packard formations of mexico
scientists disagree on the content of the genus and some recognize gorgosaurus libratus as a second species
as a tyrannosaurid albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with short arms two fingered hands and a massive head with dozens of large sharp teeth a strong sense of smell powerful binocular vision and a bone crushing bite force
it may have even been the apex predator in its local ecosystem
while albertosaurus was certainly large for a theropod it was still much smaller than its larger and more famous relative tyrannosaurus rex growing up to in length and weighing
since the first discovery in fossils of more than individuals have been recovered that provide scientists with a more detailed knowledge of albertosaurus anatomy than what is available for most other tyrannosaurids
the discovery of individuals in one particular site provides evidence of gregarious behavior and allows for studies of ontogeny and population biology
these are near impossible with lesser known dinosaurs because their remains are rarer and more fragmentary when compared to those of albertosaurus
albertosaurus was named by henry fairfield osborn in a one page note at the end of his description of tyrannosaurus rex
its namesake is alberta the canadian province established the very same year where the first remains were found
the generic name also incorporates the greek word sauros meaning lizard which is the most common suffix in dinosaur names
the type species is albertosaurus sarcophagus and the specific name is derived from the ancient greek term meaning flesh eating and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name which is a combination of the greek words and
more than specimens of all ages are known to science
the type specimen is a partial skull collected on june from an outcrop of the horseshoe canyon formation alongside the red deer river in alberta
it was recovered by an expedition of the geological survey of canada led by the famous geologist joseph burr tyrrell
due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured
in tyrrells colleague thomas chesmer weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby
the two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species laelaps incrassatus by edward drinker cope in
although the name laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to dryptosaurus in by othniel charles marsh cope stubbornly refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival
however lawrence lambe used the name dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in and which was a combination first coined by oliver perry hay in
shortly later osborn pointed out that d
incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth so the two horseshoe canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species
the horseshoe canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of d
aquilunguis type species of dryptosaurus so osborn gave them the new name albertosaurus sarcophagus in
he did not describe the remains in any great detail citing lambes complete description the year before
both specimens the holotype cmn and the paratype cmn are stored in the canadian museum of nature in ottawa
by the early twenty first century some concerns had arisen that due to the damaged state of the holotype albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it
however in thomas carr established that the holotype the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy
the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone proves that albertosaurus is a valid taxon
on august american paleontologist barnum brown discovered the remains of a large group of albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the red deer river
because of the large number of bones and the limited time available browns party did not collect every specimen but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bone bed
among the bones deposited in the american museum of natural history collections in new york city are seven sets of right metatarsals along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size
this indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry
palaeontologist philip j
currie of the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in and resumed fieldwork at the site which is now located inside dry island buffalo jump provincial park
further excavation from to turned up the remains of more individuals of various ages including a diminutive two year old and a very old individual estimated at over long
none of these individuals are known from complete skeletons and most are represented by remains in both museums
excavations continued until when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at and at if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny
a total of albertosaurus bones had been secured which is the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the cretaceous
in barnum brown during the second year of the american museum of natural historys operations in alberta uncovered a fragmentary partial albertosaurus skull at the red deer river near tolman bridge
william parks described a new species in albertosaurus arctunguis based on a partial skeleton lacking a skull that was excavated by gus lindblad and ralph hornell near the red deer river in but this species has been considered identical to a
sarcophagus since
parks specimen is housed in the royal ontario museum in toronto
no albertosaurus fossils were found from but there has been an increase in findings since then
apart from the dry island bonebed six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in alberta and are housed in various canadian museums
specimen rtmp was found in by amateur paleontologist maurice stefanuk
rtmp was found by stefanuk on june
rtmp was found in december of
rtmp was found in
rtmp was found in and then there is cmn
unfortunately none of these skeletons were found with complete skulls
fossils have also been reported from the american states of montana new mexico wyoming and missouri but they are doubted to be from a
sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus albertosaurus
two specimens from cf albertosaurus sp have been found in mexico
in paleontologist charles h
sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older dinosaur park formation in alberta
lawrence lambe named this dinosaur gorgosaurus libratus in
other specimens were later found in alberta and the us state of montana
finding no significant differences to separate the two taxa dale russell declared the name gorgosaurus a junior synonym of albertosaurus which had been named first and g
libratus was renamed albertosaurus libratus in
a species distinction was maintained because of the age difference
the addition extended the temporal range of the genus albertosaurus earlier by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres
in philip j
currie benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought
as the two species are sister taxa they are more closely related to each other than to any other species of tyrannosaurid
recognizing this currie nevertheless recommended that albertosaurus and gorgosaurus be kept as separate genera as he concluded that they were no more similar than daspletosaurus and tyrannosaurus which are almost always separated
in addition to this several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from alaska and new mexico
currie suggested that the albertosaurus gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are fully described
most authors have followed curries recommendation but some have not
in anatoly nikolaevich riabinin named albertosaurus pericolosus based on a tooth from china that probably belonged to tarbosaurus
in friedrich von huene renamed dryptosaurus incrassatus not considered a nomen dubium by him to albertosaurus incrassatus
because he had identified gorgosaurus with albertosaurus in russell also renamed gorgosaurus sternbergi into albertosaurus sternbergi and gorgosaurus lancensis into albertosaurus lancensis
the former species is today seen as a juvenile form of gorgosaurus libratus and the latter is seen as either identical to tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus nanotyrannus
in gregory s
paul based albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton specimen lacm from the hell creek formation of montana
it was renamed dinotyrannus in but is now thought to represent a juvenile tyrannosaurus rex
also in paul renamed alectrosaurus olseni into albertosaurus olseni but this has found no general acceptance
in gorgosaurus novojilovi was renamed by bryn mader and robert bradley as albertosaurus novojilovi
on two occasions species based on valid albertosaurus material were reassigned to a different genus deinodon
in william diller matthew renamed a
sarcophagus into deinodon sarcophagus
in german paleontologist oskar kuhn renamed a
arctunguis into deinodon arctunguis
albertosaurus was a fairly large bipedal predator but smaller than tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus rex
typical albertosaurus adults measured up to long and weighed between in body mass
albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids gorgosaurus in particular
typical for a theropod albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced its large heavy head and torso with a long muscular tail
however tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two functional fingers the second being longer than the first
the legs were long and ended in a four toed foot on which the first toe the hallux was very short and did not reach the ground
the third toe was longer than the rest
albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of km hour
at least for the younger individuals a high running speed is plausible
two skin impressions from albertosaurus are known and both show scales
one patch is found associated with some gastralic ribs and the impression of a long unknown bone indicating that the patch is from the belly
the scales are pebbly and gradually become larger and somewhat hexagonal in shape
also preserved are two larger feature scales placed cm apart from each other making albertosaurus along with carnotaurus the only known theropods with preserved feature scales
another skin impression is from an unknown part of the body
these scales are small diamond shaped and arranged in rows
the massive skull of albertosaurus which was perched on a muscular short s shaped neck was about long in the largest adults
wide openings in the skull called fenestrae provided space for muscle attachment sites and sensory organs that reduced its overall weight
its long jaws contained both sides combined or more banana shaped teeth
larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth but gorgosaurus had
unlike most theropods albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth
the premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw four per side were much smaller than the rest more closely packed and d shaped in cross section
like with tyrannosaurus rex the maxillary teeth of albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey animal
the bite force of albertosaurus was less formidable however with the maximum force by the back teeth reaching newtons
above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and possibly used by males in particular in courtship to attract a mate
in william abler observed that albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla
tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat the tension could cause a purely crack like serration to spread through the tooth
however the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain
the presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering
guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to as abler describes impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity to wood that they work on
the use of a drill to create an ampulla of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces
abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called kerfs and drilled holes was more than stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions
unlike tyrannosaurs more ancient predators like phytosaurs and dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding
albertosaurus is a member of the theropod family tyrannosauridae specifically the subfamily albertosaurinae
its closest relative is the slightly older gorgosaurus libratus
these two species are the only described albertosaurines but other undescribed species may exist
thomas holtz found appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in but his more recent unpublished work places it as a basal eotyrannosaurian just outside of tyrannosauridae in agreement with other authors
the other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is tyrannosaurinae which includes members like daspletosaurus tarbosaurus and tyrannosaurus
compared with the more robust tyrannosaurines albertosaurines had slender builds with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower legs and feet
below is the cladogram of tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by loewen et al
most age categories of albertosaurus are represented in the fossil record
using bone histology the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species
the youngest known albertosaurus is a two year old discovered in the dry island bonebed which would have weighed about kilograms and measured slightly more than long
the specimen from the same quarry is years old the oldest and largest one known
when specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph an s shaped growth curve results with the most rapid growth occurring in a four year period ending around the sixteenth year of life a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids
the growth rate during this phase was per year based on an adult weighing tonnes
other studies have suggested higher adult weights which would affect the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern
tyrannosaurids similar in size to albertosaurus had similar growth rates although the much larger tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate at its peak
the end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in albertosaurus although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals lives
sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals like humans and elephants
this pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing
during growth thickening of the tooth morphology changed so much that had the association of young and adult skeletons on the dry island bonebed not proven that they belonged to the same taxon the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species
most known albertosaurus individuals were aged years or older at the time of death
juvenile animals are rarely fossilized for several reasons mainly preservation bias where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults and collection bias where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field
young albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals but their remains are still rare in the fossil record when compared to adults
it has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history rather than bias and that fossils of juvenile albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did
a hypothesis of albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers but have not been preserved in the fossil record because of their small size and fragile construction
after just two years juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult albertosaurus and more fleet footed than most of their prey animals
this resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains
mortality rates doubled at age twelve perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen
this elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources and the eventual ever increasing effects of senescence
the higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation
very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such size
high infant mortality rates followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity with very few animals reaching maximum size is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals including elephants african buffalo and rhinoceros
the same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids
the comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role especially since more than two thirds of all albertosaurus specimens are known from the exact same locality
the dry island bonebed discovered by barnum brown and his crew contains the remains of albertosaurus the most individuals found in one locality of any large cretaceous theropod and the second most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the allosaurus assemblage at the cleveland lloyd dinosaur quarry in utah
the group seems to be composed of one very old adult eight adults between and years old seven sub adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between and years old and six juveniles between the ages of and years old that had not yet reached the growth phase
the near absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the albertosaurus bonebed quarry led currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap such as the la brea tar pits in california and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time
currie claims this as evidence of pack behavior
other scientists are skeptical observing that the animals may have been driven together by a drought flood or other reasons
there is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs
however only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site
small theropods like deinonychus and coelophysis have been found in aggregations as have larger predators such as allosaurus and mapusaurus
there is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well as fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside sue the tyrannosaurus mounted in the field museum of natural history in chicago and a bonebed in the two medicine formation of montana contains at least three specimens of daspletosaurus preserved alongside several hadrosaurs
these findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in albertosaurus although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations
others have speculated that instead of social groups at least some of these finds represent komodo dragon like mobbing of carcasses where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and even cannibalized
currie has also speculated on the pack hunting habits of albertosaurus
the leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs
younger albertosaurus were probably equally fleet footed or at least faster than their prey
currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults who were larger and more powerful but also slower
juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult albertosaurus in mass
a similar situation is observed in modern komodo dragons with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands
however as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare these ideas cannot readily be tested
in currie though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood
in researchers hypothesized that smooth edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to trichomonas gallinae which infects birds
they suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other and that the infection impaired their ability to eat
in bruce rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior
they found that only one of the albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did
the scientists found that stress fractures were significantly less common in albertosaurus than in the carnosaur allosaurus
rom the holotype of a
arctunguis had a deep hole in the iliac blade although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological
the specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal
in two of the five albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by dale russel as having pathological damage to them
in the health of the dry island albertosaurus assembly was reported upon
most specimens showed no sign of disease
on three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs that consisted of abnormal ossifications of the tendons so called enthesophytes were present but their cause is unknown
two ribs and a belly rib showed signs of breaking and healing
one adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks
the low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a majungasaurus population of which it was established in that of individuals showed bone pathologies
most fossils of albertosaurus sarcophagus are known from the upper horseshoe canyon formation in alberta
these younger units of this geologic formation date to the early maastrichtian age of the late cretaceous period about to million years ago
immediately below this formation is the bearpaw shale a marine formation representing a section of the western interior seaway
the inland sea was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the cretaceous thus exposing land that had previously been underwater
it was not a smooth process however and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout horseshoe canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after
due to the changing sea levels many different environments are represented in the horseshoe canyon formation including offshore and near shore marine habitats and coastal habitats such as lagoons estuaries and tidal flats
numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps
like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of horseshoe canyon times
the fauna of the horseshoe canyon formation is well known as vertebrate fossils including those of dinosaurs are very common
sharks rays sturgeons bowfins gars and the gar like aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna
mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial didelphodon
the saltwater plesiosaur leurospondylus has been found in marine sediments in the horseshoe canyon while freshwater environments were populated by turtles champsosaurus and crocodilians like leidyosuchus and stangerochampsa
dinosaurs dominate the fauna especially hadrosaurs which make up half of all dinosaurs known
these include the genera edmontosaurus saurolophus and hypacrosaurus
ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common together making up another third of the known fauna
along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods including troodontids dromaeosaurids and caenagnathids
intermingled with the albertosaurus remains of the dry island bonebed the bones of the small theropod albertonykus were found
adult albertosaurus were the apex predators in their environment with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurus
in computer programming assembly language often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as asm or asm is any low level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architectures machine code instructions
assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction but constants comments assembler directives symbolic labels of eg memory locations registers and macros are generally also supported
the first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in kathleen and andrew donald booths work coding for arc
assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler
the term assembler is generally attributed to wilkes wheeler and gill in their book the preparation of programs for an electronic digital computer who however used the term to mean a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program
the conversion process is referred to as assembly as in assembling the source code
the computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time
because assembly depends on the machine code instructions each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture
sometimes there is more than one assembler for the same architecture and sometimes an assembler is specific to an operating system or to particular operating systems
most assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest
in contrast to assembly languages most high level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling much more complicated tasks than assembling
in the first decades of computing it was commonplace for both systems programming and application programming to take place entirely in assembly language
while still irreplaceable for some purposes the majority of programming is now conducted in higher level interpreted and compiled languages
in no silver bullet fred brooks summarised the effects of the switch away from assembly language programming surely the most powerful stroke for software productivity reliability and simplicity has been the progressive use of high level languages for programming
most observers credit that development with at least a factor of five in productivity and with concomitant gains in reliability simplicity and comprehensibility
today it is typical to use small amounts of assembly language code within larger systems implemented in a higher level language for performance reasons or to interact directly with hardware in ways unsupported by the higher level language
for instance just under of version of the linux kernel source code is written in assembly more than is written in c
assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent eg each low level machine instruction or opcode each directive typically also each architectural register flag etc
some of the mnemonics may be built in and some user defined
many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction
most assemblers permit named constants registers and labels for program and memory locations and can calculate expressions for operands
thus programmers are freed from tedious repetitive calculations and assembler programs are much more readable than machine code
depending on the architecture these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offsets or other data as well as fixed addresses
many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development to control the assembly process and to aid debugging
some are column oriented with specific fields in specific columns this was very common for machines using punched cards in the s and early s
some assemblers have free form syntax with fields separated by delimiters eg punctuation white space
some assemblers are hybrid with eg labels in a specific column and other fields separated by delimiters this became more common than column oriented syntax in the s
all of the ibm assemblers for system by default have a label in column fields separated by delimiters in columns a continuation indicator in column and a sequence number in columns
the delimiter for label opcode operands and comments is spaces while individual operands are separated by commas and parentheses
an assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents
this representation typically includes an operation code as well as other control bits and data
the assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities
the use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications
most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution eg to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline instead of called subroutines
some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set specific optimizations
one concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x assemblers from various vendors
called jump sizing most of them are able to perform jump instruction replacements in any number of passes on request
others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions such as some assemblers for risc architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the cpu pipeline as efficiently as possible
assemblers have been available since the s as the first step above machine language and before high level programming languages such as fortran algol cobol and lisp
there have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages with speedcode as perhaps one of the better known examples
there may be several assemblers with different syntax for a particular cpu or instruction set architecture
for instance an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x family processor might be codice in original intel syntax whereas this would be written codice in the att syntax used by the gnu assembler
despite different appearances different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric machine code
a single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations
there are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed to produce the object file
in both cases the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols
this means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation and if necessary pad it with one or more no operation instructions in a later pass or the errata
in an assembler with peephole optimization addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target
the original reason for the use of one pass assemblers was memory size and speed of assembly often a second pass would require storing the symbol table in memory rewinding and rereading the program source on tape or rereading a deck of cards or punched paper tape
later computers with much larger memories had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re reading
the advantage of the multi pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the linking process faster
example in the following code snippet a one pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference bkwd when assembling statement s but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference fwd when assembling the branch statement s indeed fwd may be undefined
a two pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass so they would be known when generating code in pass
see language design below for more details
a program written in assembly language consists of a series of mnemonic processor instructions and meta statements comments and data
assembly language instructions usually consist of an opcode mnemonic followed by an operand which might be a list of data arguments or parameters
some instructions may be implied which means the data upon which the instruction operates is implicitly defined by the instruction itself such an instruction does not take an operand
the resulting statement is translated by an assembler into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed
for example the instruction below tells an x ia processor to move an immediate bit value into a register
the binary code for this instruction is followed by a bit identifier for which register to use
the identifier for the al register is so the following machine code loads the al register with the data
this binary computer code can be made more human readable by expressing it in hexadecimal as follows
here codice means move a copy of the following value into al and codice is a hexadecimal representation of the value which is in decimal
assembly language for the family provides the mnemonic mov for instructions such as this so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language complete with an explanatory comment if required after the semicolon
this is much easier to read and to remember
mov al h load al with decimal in some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as mov may be used for a family of related instructions for loading copying and moving data whether these are immediate values values in registers or memory locations pointed to by values in registers or by immediate addresses
other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as l for move memory to register st for move register to memory lr for move register to register mvi for move immediate operand to memory etc
if the same mnemonic is used for different instructions that means that the mnemonic corresponds to several different binary instruction codes excluding data depending on the operands that follow the mnemonic
for example for the x ia cpus the intel assembly language syntax codice represents an instruction that moves the contents of register ah into register al
the hexadecimal form of this instruction is the first byte h identifies a move between a byte sized register and either another register or memory and the second byte eh is encoded to specify that both operands are registers the source is ah and the destination is al
in a case like this where the same mnemonic can represent more than one binary instruction the assembler determines which instruction to generate by examining the operands
in the first example the operand codice is a valid hexadecimal numeric constant and is not a valid register name so only the codice instruction can be applicable
in the second example the operand codice is a valid register name and not a valid numeric constant so only the codice instruction can be applicable
assembly languages are always designed so that this sort of unambiguousness is universally enforced by their syntax
for example in the intel x assembly language a hexadecimal constant must start with a numeral digit so that the hexadecimal number a would be written as codice or codice not codice specifically so that it cannot appear to be the name of register ah
returning to the original example while the x opcode copies an bit value into the al register moves it into cl and does so into dl
assembly language examples for these follow
mov al h load al with immediate value mov cl h load cl with immediate value mov dl h load dl with immediate value the syntax of mov can also be more complex as the following examples show
mov eax move the bytes in memory at the address contained in ebx into eax mov cl move the contents of cl into the byte at address esieax mov ds dx move the contents of dx into segment register ds in each case the mov mnemonic is translated directly into one of the opcodes c e a a b bf c or c by an assembler and the programmer normally does not have to know or remember which
transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a disassembler
unlike high level languages there is a one to one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions
however in some cases an assembler may provide pseudoinstructions which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality
for example for a machine that lacks a branch if greater or equal instruction an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machines set if less than and branch if zero
most full featured assemblers also provide a rich macro language which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences
since the information about pseudoinstructions and macros defined in the assembler environment is not present in the object program a disassembler cannot reconstruct the macro and pseudoinstruction invocations but can only disassemble the actual machine instructions that the assembler generated from those abstract assembly language entities
likewise since comments in the assembly language source file are ignored by the assembler and have no effect on the object code it generates a disassembler is always completely unable to recover source comments
each computer architecture has its own machine language
computers differ in the number and type of operations they support in the different sizes and numbers of registers and in the representations of data in storage
while most general purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality the ways they do so differ the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences
multiple sets of mnemonics or assembly language syntax may exist for a single instruction set typically instantiated in different assembler programs
in these cases the most popular one is usually that supplied by the cpu manufacturer and used in its documentation
two examples of cpus that have two different sets of mnemonics are the intel family and the intel
because intel claimed copyright on its assembly language mnemonics some companies that independently produced cpus compatible with intel instruction sets invented their own mnemonics
the zilog z cpu an enhancement of the intel a supports all the a instructions plus many more zilog invented an entirely new assembly language not only for the new instructions but also for all of the a instructions
for example where intel uses the mnemonics mov mvi lda sta lxi ldax stax lhld and shld for various data transfer instructions the z assembly language uses the mnemonic ld for all of them
a similar case is the nec v and v cpus enhanced copies of the intel and respectively
like zilog with the z nec invented new mnemonics for all of the and instructions to avoid accusations of infringement of intels copyright
it is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the v and v actually wrote in necs assembly language rather than intels since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are isomorphic there is no requirement to use a manufacturers own published assembly language with that manufacturers products
there is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use
in particular some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo operation
a typical assembly language consists of types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations instructions in assembly language are generally very simple unlike those in high level languages
generally a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction
each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands
most instructions refer to a single value or a pair of values
operands can be immediate registers specified in the instruction or implied or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage
this is determined by the underlying processor architecture the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works
extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand eg the system assemblers use as an extended mnemonic for with a mask of and for with a mask of
extended mnemonics are often used to support specialized uses of instructions often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name
for example many cpus do not have an explicit nop instruction but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose
in cpus the instruction is used for with being a pseudo opcode to encode the instruction
some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the instruction as
similarly ibm assemblers for system and system use the extended mnemonics and for and with zero masks
for the sparc architecture these are known as synthetic instructions
some assemblers also support simple built in macro instructions that generate two or more machine instructions
for instance with some z assemblers the instruction is recognized to generate followed by
these are sometimes known as pseudo opcodes
mnemonics are arbitrary symbols in the ieee published standard for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers
the standard has since been withdrawn
there are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables
they define the type of data the length and the alignment of data
these instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs or only to the program in which the data section is defined
some assemblers classify these as pseudo ops
assembly directives also called pseudo opcodes pseudo operations or pseudo ops are commands given to an assembler directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions
directives affect how the assembler operates and may affect the object code the symbol table the listing file and the values of internal assembler parameters
sometimes the term pseudo opcode is reserved for directives that generate object code such as those that generate data
the names of pseudo ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions
pseudo ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer so that one program can be assembled in different ways perhaps for different applications
or a pseudo op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain
another common use of pseudo ops is to reserve storage areas for run time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values
symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names with memory locations and various constants
usually every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name thus promoting self documenting code
in executable code the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point so any calls to a subroutine can use its name
inside subroutines goto destinations are given labels
some assemblers support local symbols which are often lexically distinct from normal symbols
some assemblers such as nasm provide flexible symbol management letting programmers manage different namespaces automatically calculate offsets within data structures and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler
labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses
assembly languages like most other computer languages allow comments to be added to program source code that will be ignored during assembly
judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine
the raw assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made
many assemblers support predefined macros and others support programmer defined macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded
the macro definition is most commonly a mixture of assembler statements eg directives symbolic machine instructions and templates for assembler statements
this sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives
once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic
when the assembler processes such a statement it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro then processes them as if they existed in the source code file
macros in this sense date to ibm autocoders of the s
macro assemblers typically have directives to eg define macros define variables set variables to the result of an arithmetic logical or string expression iterate conditionally generate code
some of those directives may be restricted to use within a macro definition eg mexit in hlasm while others may be permitted within open code eg aif and copy in hlasm
in assembly language the term macro represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts such as the pre processor in the c programming language where its define directive typically is used to create short single line macros
assembler macro instructions like macros in pl i and some other languages can be lengthy programs by themselves executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly
since macros can have short names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter requiring fewer lines of source code as with higher level languages
they can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features
macro assemblers often allow macros to take parameters
some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages incorporating such high level language elements as optional parameters symbolic variables conditionals string manipulation and arithmetic operations all usable during the execution of a given macro and allowing macros to save context or exchange information
thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions based on the macro arguments
this could be used to generate record style data structures or unrolled loops for example or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters
for instance a sort macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key not needing the run time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification
an organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher level language since such programmers are not working with a computers lowest level conceptual elements
underlining this point macros were used to implement an early virtual machine in snobol which was written in the snobol implementation language an assembly language for a virtual machine
the target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assembler
this allowed a high degree of portability for the time
macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems
this was done for example by systems programmers working with ibms conversational monitor system virtual machine and with ibms real time transaction processing add ons customer information control system cics and acp tpf the airline financial system that began in the s and still runs many large computer reservation systems and credit card systems today
it is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages for example to generate a version of a program in cobol using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of cobol code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code
ibm os uses macros to perform system generation
the user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros
assembling these macros generates a job stream to build the system including job control language and utility control statements
this is because as was realized in the s the concept of macro processing is independent of the concept of assembly the former being in modern terms more word processing text processing than generating object code
the concept of macro processing appeared and appears in the c programming language which supports preprocessor instructions to set variables and make conditional tests on their values
unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers the c preprocessor is not turing complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or go to the latter allowing programs to loop
despite the power of macro processing it fell into disuse in many high level languages while remaining a perennial for assemblers
macro parameter substitution is strictly by name at macro processing time the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name
the most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name
in the macro the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable and the global variable or constant b would be used to multiply a
if foo is called with the parameter codice the macro expansion of codice occurs
to avoid any possible ambiguity users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions or callers can parenthesize the input parameters
packages of macros have been written providing structured programming elements to encode execution flow
the earliest example of this approach was in the concept macro set originally proposed by harlan mills and implemented by marvin kessler at ibms federal systems division which provided if else endif and similar control flow blocks for os assembler programs
this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of goto operations in assembly code one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language
this approach was widely accepted in the early s
ibms high level assembler toolkit includes such a macro package
a curious design was a natural a stream oriented assembler for z processors from whitesmiths ltd
the language was classified as an assembler because it worked with raw machine elements such as opcodes registers and memory references but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order
parentheses and other special symbols along with block oriented structured programming constructs controlled the sequence of the generated instructions
a natural was built as the object language of a c compiler rather than for hand coding but its logical syntax won some fans
there has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large scale assembly language development
in spite of that they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target systems architecture prevent the effective use of higher level languages
include masmincludemasmrtinc use the masm library code switch rv generate a number between and mov ecx case print case case ecx in contrast to most other programming languages print case the masm switch allows variable cases case

kathleen booth is credited with inventing assembly language based on theoretical work she began in while working on the arc at birkbeck university of london following consultation by andrew booth with mathematician john von neumann and physicist herman goldstine at the institute for advanced study
in late the electronic delay storage automatic calculator had an assembler integrated into its bootstrap program
it used one letter mnemonics developed by david wheeler who is credited by the ieee computer society as the creator of the first assembler
reports on the edsac introduced the term assembly for the process of combining fields into an instruction word
soap was an assembly language for the ibm computer written by stan poley in
assembly languages eliminate much of the error prone tedious and time consuming first generation programming needed with the earliest computers freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses
they were once widely used for all sorts of programming
however by the late s their use had largely been supplanted by higher level languages in the search for improved programming productivity
today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation access to specialized processor instructions or to address critical performance issues
typical uses are device drivers low level embedded systems and real time systems
numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language
the burroughs mcp was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language it was written in executive systems problem oriented language an algol dialect
many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well including a large amount of the ibm mainframe software written by large corporations
cobol fortran and some pl i eventually displaced much of this work although a number of large organizations retained assembly language application infrastructures well into the s
assembly language has long been the primary development language for bit home computers such atari bit family apple ii msx zx spectrum and commodore
interpreted basic dialects on these systems offer insufficient execution speed and insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware
these systems have severe resource constraints idiosyncratic memory and display architectures and provide limited system services
there are also few high level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use
similarly assembly language is the default choice for bit consoles such as the atari and nintendo entertainment system
key software for ibm pc compatibles was written in assembly language such as ms dos turbo pascal and the lotus spreadsheet
as computer speed grew exponentially assembly language became a tool for speeding up parts of programs such as the rendering of doom rather than a dominant development language
in the s assembly language was used to get performance out of systems such as the sega saturn and as the primary language for arcade hardware based on the tms integrated cpu gpu such as mortal kombat and nba jam
there has been debate over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high level languages
although assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important there are other tools for optimization
the tiobe index of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at ahead of visual basic for example
assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size
in the case of speed optimization modern optimizing compilers are claimed to render high level languages into code that can run as fast as hand written assembly despite the counter examples that can be found
the complexity of modern processors and memory sub systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers as well as for assembly programmers
moreover increasing processor performance has meant that most cpus sit idle most of the time with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses i o operations and paging
this has made raw code execution speed a non issue for many programmers
assembly language is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs
although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool the underlying concepts remain important
such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic memory allocation stack processing character set encoding interrupt processing and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level
since a computers behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language
most modern computers have similar instruction sets
therefore studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn i the basic concepts ii to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate and iii to see how efficient executable code can be created from high level languages
in the ancient greek myths ambrosia the food or drink of the greek gods is often depicted as conferring longevity or immortality upon whoever consumed it
it was brought to the gods in olympus by doves and served either by hebe or by ganymede at the heavenly feast
ancient art sometimes depicted ambrosia as distributed by the nymph named ambrosia a nurse of dionysus
ambrosia is very closely related to the gods other form of sustenance nectar
the two terms may not have originally been distinguished though in homers poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods it was with ambrosia that hera cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh and with ambrosia athena prepared penelope in her sleep so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors the effects of years had been stripped away and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her
on the other hand in alcman nectar is the food and in sappho and anaxandrides ambrosia is the drink
a character in aristophanes knights says i dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head out of a ladle
both descriptions could be correct as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food
the consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings
upon his assumption into immortality on olympus heracles is given ambrosia by athena while the hero tydeus is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains
in one version of the myth of tantalus part of tantalus crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself he attempts to steal some to give to other mortals
those who consume ambrosia typically have ichor not blood in their veins
both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant and may be used as perfume in the odyssey menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore but the goddess saved us she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils
homer speaks of ambrosial raiment ambrosial locks of hair even the gods ambrosial sandals
among later writers ambrosia has been so often used with generic meanings of delightful liquid that such late writers as athenaeus paulus and dioscurides employ it as a technical term in contexts of cookery medicine and botany
pliny used the term in connection with different plants as did early herbalists
additionally some modern ethnomycologists such as danny staples identify ambrosia with the hallucinogenic mushroom amanita muscaria it was the food of the gods their ambrosia and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices staples asserts
roscher thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of honey in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey and because fermented honey preceded wine as an entheogen in the aegean world on some minoan seals goddesses were represented with bee faces
the concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two ancient indo european languages greek and sanskrit
the greek is semantically linked to the sanskrit as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality
the two words appear to be derived from the same indo european form m ts un dying
a semantically similar etymology exists for nectar the beverage of the gods presumed to be a compound of the pie roots nek death and tar overcoming
lycurgus king of thrace forbade the cult of dionysus whom he drove from thrace and attacked the gods entourage when they celebrated the god
among them was ambrosia who turned herself into a grapevine to hide from his wrath
dionysus enraged by the kings actions drove him mad
in his fit of insanity he killed his son whom he mistook for a stock of ivy and then himself
ambrose of milan venerated as saint ambrose was a theologian and statesman who served as bishop of milan from to
he expressed himself prominently as a public figure fiercely promoting roman christianity against arianism and paganism
he left a substantial collection of writings of which the best known include the ethical commentary de officiis ministrorum and the exegetical
his preachings his actions and his literary works in addition to his innovative musical hymnography made him one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the th century
ambrose was serving as the roman governor of aemilia liguria in milan when he was unexpectedly made bishop of milan in by popular acclamation
as bishop he took a firm position against arianism and attempted to mediate the conflict between the emperors theodosius i and magnus maximus
tradition credits ambrose with developing an antiphonal chant known as ambrosian chant and for composing the te deum hymn though modern scholars now reject both of these attributions
ambroses authorship on at least four hymns including the well known veni redemptor gentium is secure they form the core of the ambrosian hymns which includes others that are sometimes attributed to him
he also had notable influence on augustine of hippo whom he helped convert to christianity
western christianity identified ambrose as one of its four traditional doctors of the church
he is considered a saint by the catholic church eastern orthodox church anglican communion and various lutheran denominations and venerated as the patron saint of milan and beekeepers
legends about ambrose had spread through the empire long before his biography was written making it difficult for modern historians to understand his true character and fairly place his behavior within the context of antiquity
most agree he was the personification of his era
this would make ambrose a genuinely spiritual man who spoke up and defended his faith against opponents an aristocrat who retained many of the attitudes and practices of a roman governor and also an ascetic who served the poor
ambrose was born into a roman christian family in the year
ambrose himself wrote that he was years old in his letter number which has been dated to
he began life in augusta trevorum the capital of the roman province of gallia belgica in what was then northeastern gaul and is now in the rhineland palatinate in germany
scholars disagree on who exactly his father was
his father is sometimes identified with aurelius ambrosius a praetorian prefect of gaul but some scholars identify his father as an official named uranius who received an imperial constitution dated february
what does seem certain is that ambrose was born in trier and his father was either the praetorian prefect or part of his administration
a legend about ambrose as an infant recounts that a swarm of bees settled on his face while he lay in his cradle leaving behind a drop of honey
his father is said to have considered this a sign of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue
bees and beehives often appear in the saints symbology
ambrose mother was a woman of intellect and piety
it was probable that she was a member of the roman family aurelii symmachi which would make ambrose a cousin of the orator quintus aurelius symmachus
the family had produced one martyr in its history
ambrose was the youngest of three children
his siblings were satyrus the subject of ambroses de excessu fratris satyri and marcellina who made a profession of virginity sometime between and pope liberius himself conferred the veil upon her
both ambroses siblings also became venerated as saints
some time early in the life of ambrose his father died
at an unknown later date his mother fled trier with her three children and the family moved to rome
there ambrose studied literature law and rhetoric
he then followed in his fathers footsteps and entered public service
praetorian prefect sextus claudius petronius probus first gave him a place as a judicial councillor and then in about made him governor of the province of liguria and emilia with headquarters at milan
in the bishop of milan auxentius an arian died and the arians challenged the succession
ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place to prevent an uproar which seemed probable in this crisis
his address was interrupted by a call ambrose bishop which was taken up by the whole assembly
ambrose though known to be nicene christian in belief was considered acceptable to arians due to the charity he had shown concerning their beliefs
at first he energetically refused the office of bishop for which he felt he was in no way prepared ambrose was a relatively new christian who was not yet baptized nor formally trained in theology
ambrose fled to a colleagues home seeking to hide
upon receiving a letter from the emperor gratian praising the appropriateness of rome appointing individuals worthy of holy positions ambroses host gave him up
within a week he was baptized ordained and duly consecrated as the new bishop of milan
this was the first time in the west that a member of the upper class of high officials had accepted the office of bishop
as bishop he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle apportioned his money to the poor donating all of his land making only provision for his sister marcellina
this raised his standing even further it was his popularity with the people that gave him considerable political leverage throughout his career
upon the unexpected appointment of ambrose to the episcopate his brother satyrus resigned a prefecture in order to move to milan where he took over managing the dioceses temporal affairs
arius was a christian priest who asserted that god the father must have created the son making the son a lesser being who was not eternal and of a different essence than god the father
this christology though contrary to tradition quickly spread through egypt and libya and other roman provinces
bishops engaged in wordy warfare and the people divided into parties sometimes demonstrating in the streets in support of one side or the other
arianism appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the western and eastern empires
although the western emperor gratian supported orthodoxy his younger half brother valentinian ii who became his colleague in the empire in adhered to the arian creed
ambrose sought to refute arian propositions theologically but ambrose did not sway the young princes position
in the east emperor theodosius i likewise professed the nicene creed but there were many adherents of arianism throughout his dominions especially among the higher clergy
in this state of religious ferment two leaders of the arians bishops palladius of ratiaria and secundianus of singidunum confident of numbers prevailed upon gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire
this request appeared so equitable that gratian complied without hesitation
however ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the western bishops
accordingly a synod composed of thirty two bishops was held at aquileia in the year
ambrose was elected president and palladius being called upon to defend his opinions declined
a vote was then taken and palladius and his associate secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices
ambrose struggled with arianism for over half of his term in the episcopate
ecclesiastical unity was important to the church but it was no less important to the state and as a roman ambrose felt strongly about that
judaism was more attractive for those seeking conversion than previous scholars have realized and pagans were still in the majority
conflict over heresies loomed large in an age of religious ferment comparable to the reformation of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
orthodox christianity was determining how to define itself as it faced multiple challenges on both a theological and a practical level and ambrose exercised crucial influence at a crucial time
ambrose had good relations and varying levels of influence with the roman emperors gratian valentinian ii and theodosius i but exactly how much influence what kind of influence and in what ways when has been debated in the scholarship of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries
it has long been convention to see gratian and ambrose as having a personal friendship putting ambrose in the dominant role of spiritual guide but modern scholars now find this view hard to support from the sources
the ancient christian historian sozomen is the only ancient source that shows ambrose and gratian together in any personal interaction
in that interaction sozomen relates that in the last year of gratians reign ambrose crashed gratians private hunting party in order to appeal on behalf of a pagan senator sentenced to die
after years of acquaintance this indicates that ambrose could not take for granted that gratian would see him so instead ambrose had to resort to such maneuverings to make his appeal
gratian was personally devout long before meeting ambrose
modern scholarship indicates gratians religious policies do not evidence capitulation to ambrose more than they evidence gratians own views
gratians devotion did lead ambrose to write a large number of books and letters of theology and spiritual commentary dedicated to the emperor
the sheer volume of these writings and the effusive praise they contain has led many historians to conclude that gratian was dominated by ambrose and it was that dominance that produced gratians anti pagan actions
mclynn asserts that effusive praises were common in everyones correspondence with the crown
he adds that gratians actions were determined by the constraints of the system as much as by his own initiatives or ambroses influence
mclynn asserts that the largest influence on gratians policy was the profound change in political circumstances produced by the battle of adrianople in
gratian had become involved in fighting the goths the previous year and had been on his way to the balkans when his uncle and the cream of the eastern army were destroyed at adrianople
gratian withdrew to sirmium and set up his court there
several rival groups including the arians sought to secure benefits from the government at sirmium
in an arian attempt to undermine ambrose whom gratian had not yet met gratian was warned that ambrose faith was suspect
gratian took steps to investigate by writing to ambrose and asking him to explain his faith
ambrose and gratian first met after this in during a visit to milan
the bishop made a good impression on gratian and his court which was pervasively christian and aristocratic much like ambrose himself
the emperor returned to milan in to find that ambrose had complied with his request for a statement of his faith in two volumes known as de fide a statement of orthodoxy and of ambrose political theology as well as a polemic against the arian heresy intended for public discussion
the emperor had not asked to be instructed by ambrose and in de fide ambrose states this clearly
nor was he asked to refute the arians
he was asked to justify his own position but in the end he did all three
it seems that by ambrose had replaced ausonius to become a major influence in gratians court
ambrose had not yet become the conscience of kings he would in the later s but he did speak out against reinstating the altar of victory
in gratian was the first to divert public financial subsidies that had previously supported romes cults
before that year contributions in support of the ancient customs had continued unchallenged by the state
the childless gratian had treated his younger brother valentinian ii like a son
ambrose on the other hand had incurred the lasting enmity of valentinian iis mother the empress justina in the winter of by helping to appoint a nicene bishop in sirmium
not long after this valentinian ii his mother and the court left sirmium sirmium had come under theodosius control so they went to milan which was ruled by gratian
in gratian was assassinated at lyon in gaul by magnus maximus
valentinian was twelve years old and the assassination left his mother justina in a position of something akin to a regent
in the emperor valentinian ii and his mother justina along with a considerable number of clergy the laity and the military professed arianism
conflict between ambrose and justina soon followed
the arians demanded that valentinian allocate to them two churches in milan one in the city the other in the suburbs
ambrose refused to surrender the churches
he answered by saying that what belongs to god is outside the emperors power
in this ambrose called on an ancient roman principle a temple set apart to a god became the property of that god
ambrose now applied this ancient legal principle to the christian churches seeing the bishop as a divine representative as guardian of his gods property
subsequently while ambrose was performing the liturgy of the hours in the basilica the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give it up to the arians
ambrose again refused
certain deans were sent to take possession of the basilica by hanging upon it imperial escutcheons
instead soldiers from the ranks the emperor had placed around the basilica began pouring into the church assuring ambrose of their fidelity
the escutcheons outside the church were removed and legend says the children tore them to shreds
ambrose refused to surrender the basilica and sent sharp answers back to his emperor if you demand my person i am ready to submit carry me to prison or to death i will not resist but i will never betray the church of christ
i will not call upon the people to succour me i will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it
the tumult of the people i will not encourage but god alone can appease it
by thursday the emperor gave in bitterly responding soon if ambrose gives the orders you will be sending me to him in chains
in justina and valentinian ii received the arian bishop auxentius the younger and ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in milan for arian usage
ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church and again the imperial order was rescinded
there was an attempted kidnapping and another attempt to arrest him and to force him to leave the city
several accusations were made but unlike in the case of john chrysostom no formal charges were brought
the emperor certainly had the power to do so and probably did not solely because of ambrose popularity with the people and what they might do
when magnus maximus usurped power in gaul and was considering a descent upon italy valentinian sent ambrose to dissuade him and the embassy was successful
a second later embassy was unsuccessful
magnus maximus entered italy and milan was taken
justina and her son fled but ambrose remained and had the plate of the church melted for the relief of the poor
while ambrose was writing de fide theodosius published his own statement of faith in in an edict establishing nicene catholic christianity as the only legitimate version of the christian faith
there is unanimity amongst scholars that this represents the emperors own beliefs
the aftermath of the death of valens had left many questions for the church unresolved and theodosius edict can be seen as an effort to begin addressing those questions
theodosius natural generosity was tempered by his pressing need to establish himself and to publicly assert his personal piety
on february theodosius issued the edict of thessalonica a decree addressed to the city of constantinople determining that only christians who did not support arian views were catholic and could have their places of worship officially recognized as churches
the edict opposed arianism and attempted to establish unity in christianity and to suppress heresy
german ancient historian writes that the edict of thessalonica was neither anti pagan nor antisemitic it did not declare christianity to be the official religion of the empire and it gave no advantage to christians over other faiths
liebeschuetz and hill indicate that it was not until after during theodosius stay in milan following the defeat of maximus in that theodosius and ambrose first met
after the massacre of thessalonica in theodosius made an act of public penance at ambroses behest
ambrose was away from court during the events at thessalonica but after being informed of them he wrote theodosius a letter
in that still existing letter ambrose presses for a semi public demonstration of penitence from the emperor telling him that as his bishop he will not give theodosius communion until it is done
wolf liebeschuetz says theodosius duly complied and came to church without his imperial robes until christmas when ambrose openly admitted him to communion
formerly some scholars credited ambrose with having an undue influence over the emperor theodosius i from this period forward prompting him toward major anti pagan legislation beginning in february of
however this interpretation has been heavily disputed since the late twentieth century
mclynn argues that theodosiuss anti pagan legislation was too limited in scope for it to be of interest to the bishop
the fabled encounter at the door of the cathedral in milan with ambrose as the mitred prelate braced blocking theodosius from entering which has sometimes been seen as evidence of ambrose dominance over theodosius has been debunked by modern historians as a pious fiction
there was no encounter at the church door
the story is a product of the imagination of theodoret a historian of the fifth century who wrote of the events of using his own ideology to fill the gaps in the historical record
the twenty first century view is that ambrose was not a power behind the throne
the two men did not meet each other frequently and documents that reveal the relationship between the two are less about personal friendship than they are about negotiations between two formidable leaders of the powerful institutions they represent the roman state and the italian church
cameron says there is no evidence that ambrose was a significant influence on the emperor
for centuries after his death theodosius was regarded as a champion of christian orthodoxy who decisively stamped out paganism
this view was recorded by theodoret who is recognized as an unreliable historian in the century following their deaths
theodosiuss predecessors constantine constantius and valens had all been semi arians
therefore it fell to the orthodox theodosius to receive from christian literary tradition most of the credit for the final triumph of christianity
modern scholars see this as an interpretation of history by orthodox christian writers more than as a representation of actual history
the view of a pious theodosius submitting meekly to the authority of the church represented by ambrose is part of the myth that evolved within a generation of their deaths
in april arbogast and his puppet emperor eugenius marched into italy to consolidate their position in regard to theodosius i and his son honorius whom theodosius had appointed augustus to govern the western portion of the empire
arbogast and eugenius courted ambroses support by very obliging letters but before they arrived at milan he had retired to bologna where he assisted at the translation of the relics of saints vitalis and agricola
from there he went to florence where he remained until eugenius withdrew from milan to meet theodosius in the battle of the frigidus in early september
soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the roman empire theodosius died at milan in and ambrose gave the eulogy
two years later ambrose also died
he was succeeded as bishop of milan by simplician
ambroses body may still be viewed in the church of saint ambrogio in milan where it has been continuously venerated along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of saints gervase and protase
ambrose is remembered in the calendar of the roman rite of the catholic church on december and is also honored in the church of england and in the episcopal church on december
in neil b
mclynn wrote a complex study of ambrose that focused on his politics and intended to demonstrate that ambrose viewed community as a means to acquire personal political power
subsequent studies of how ambrose handled his episcopal responsibilities his nicene theology and his dealings with the arians in his episcopate his pastoral care his commitment to community and his personal asceticism have mitigated this view
all of ambrose writings are works of advocacy of his religion and even his political views and actions were closely related to his religion
he was rarely if ever concerned about simply recording what had happened he did not write to reveal his inner thoughts and struggles he wrote to advocate for his god
boniface ramsey writes that it is difficult not to posit a deep spirituality in a man who wrote on the mystical meanings of the song of songs and wrote many extraordinary hymns
in spite of an abiding spirituality ambrose had a generally straightforward manner and a practical rather than a speculative tendency in his thinking
de officiis is a utilitarian guide for his clergy in their daily ministry in the milanese church rather than an intellectual tour de force
christian faith in the third century developed the monastic life style which subsequently spread into the rest of roman society in a general practice of virginity voluntary poverty and self denial for religious reasons
this life style was embraced by many new converts including ambrose even though they did not become actual monks
the bishops of this era had heavy administrative responsibilities and ambrose was also sometimes occupied with imperial affairs but he still fulfilled his primary responsibility to care for the well being of his flock
he preached and celebrated the eucharist multiple times a week sometimes daily dealt directly with the needs of the poor as well as widows and orphans virgins and his own clergy
he replied to letters personally practiced hospitality and made himself available to the people
ambrose had the ability to maintain good relationships with all kinds of people
local church practices varied quite a bit from place to place at this time and as the bishop ambrose could have required that everyone adapt to his way of doing things
it was his place to keep the churches as united as possible in both ritual and belief
instead he respected local customs adapting himself to whatever practices prevailed instructing his mother to do the same
as bishop ambrose undertook many different labors in an effort to unite people and provide some stability during a period of religious political military and social upheavals and transformations
brown says ambrose had the makings of a faction fighter
while he got along well with most people ambrose was not averse to conflict and even opposed emperors with a fearlessness born of self confidence and a clear conscience and not from any belief he would not suffer for his decisions
having begun his life as a roman aristocrat and a governor it is clear that ambrose retained the attitude and practice of roman governance even after becoming a bishop
his acts and writings show he was quite clear about the limits of imperial power over the churchs internal affairs including doctrine moral teaching and governance
he wrote to valentinian in matters of faith bishops are the judges of christian emperors not emperors of bishops
he also famously told to the arian bishop chosen by the emperor the emperor is in the church not over the church
ambroses acts and writings created a sort of model which was to remain valid in the latin west for the relations of the church and the christian state
both powers stood in a basically positive relationship to each other but the innermost sphere of the churchs life faith the moral order ecclesiastical discipline remained withdrawn from the states influence
ambrose was also well aware of the limits of his power
at the height of his career as a venerable respected and well loved bishop in imperial agents marched into his church pushing past him and his clergy who had crowded the altar to protect a political suspect from arrest and dragged the man from the church in front of ambrose who could do nothing to stop it
when it came to the central functions of the roman state even the vivid ambrose was a lightweight
the most notorious example of ambroses anti jewish animus occurred in when emperor theodosius i was informed that a crowd of christians had retaliated against the local jewish community by destroying the synagogue at callinicum on the euphrates
the synagogue most likely existed within the fortified town to service the soldiers serving there and theodosius ordered that the offenders be punished and that the synagogue be rebuilt at the expense of the bishop
ambrose wrote to the emperor arguing against this basing his argument on two assertions first if the bishop obeyed the order it would be a betrayal of his faith
second if the bishop instead refused to obey the order he would become a martyr and create a scandal for the emperor
ambrose referring to a prior incident where magnus maximus issued an edict censuring christians in rome for burning down a jewish synagogue warned theodosius that the people in turn exclaimed the emperor has become a jew implying theodosius would receive the same lack of support from the people
theodosius rescinded the order concerning the bishop
that was not enough for ambrose and when theodosius next visited milan ambrose confronted him directly in an effort to get the emperor to drop the entire case
mclynn argues that ambrose failed to win the emperors sympathy and was mostly excluded from his counsels thereafter
the callinicum affair was not an isolated incident
generally speaking ambrose presents a strong anti jewish polemic
while mclynn says this makes ambrose look like a bully and a bigot to modern eyes scholars also agree ambrose attitudes toward the jews cannot be fairly summarized in one sentence as not all of ambrose attitudes toward jews were negative
ambrose makes extensive and appreciative use of the works of philo of alexandria a jew in ambrose own writings treating philo as one of the faithful interpreters of the scriptures
philo was an educated man of some standing and a prolific writer during the era of second temple judaism
forty three of his treatises have been preserved and these by christians rather than jews
philo became foundational in forming the christian literary view on the six days of creation through basils hexaemeron
eusebius the cappadocian fathers and didymus the blind appropriated material from philo as well but none did so more than ambrose
as a result of this extensive referencing philo was accepted into the christian tradition as an honorary church father
in fact one byzantine catena even refers to him as bishop philo
this high regard for philo even led to a number of legends of his conversion to christianity although this assertion stands on very dubious evidence
ambrose also used josephus maccabees and other jewish sources for his writings
he praises some individual jews
ambrose tended to write negatively of all non nicenes as if they were all one category
this served a rhetorical purpose in his writing and should be considered accordingly
modern scholarship indicates paganism was a lesser concern than heresy for christians in the fourth and fifth centuries which was the case for ambrose but it was still a concern
writings of this period were commonly hostile and often contemptuous toward a paganism christianity saw as already defeated in heaven
the great christian writers of the third to fifth centuries attempted to discredit continuation in these defeated practices by searching pagan writings particularly those of varro for everything that could be regarded by christian standards as repulsive and irreligious
ambrose work reflects this triumphalism
throughout his time in the episcopate ambrose was active in his opposition to any state sponsorship of pagan cults
when gratian ordered the altar of victory to be removed it roused the aristocracy of rome to send a delegation to the emperor to appeal the decision but pope damasus i got the christian senators to petition against it and ambrose blocked the delegates from getting an audience with the emperor
under valentinian ii an effort was made to restore the altar of victory to its ancient station in the hall of the roman senate and to again provide support for the seven vestal virgins
the pagan party was led by the refined senator quintus aurelius symmachus who used all his prodigious skill and artistry to create a marvelous document full of the maiestas populi romani
hans lietzmann writes that pagans and christians alike were stirred by the solemn earnestness of an admonition which called all men of goodwill to the aid of a glorious history to render all worthy honor to a world that was fading away
then ambrose wrote valentinian ii a letter asserting that the emperor was a soldier of god not simply a personal believer but one bound by his position to serve the faith under no circumstances could he agree to something that would promote the worship of idols
ambrose held up the example of valentinians brother gratian reminding valentinian that the commandment of god must take precedence
the bishops intervention led to the failure of symmachus appeal
in ambrose intervened against a pagan senatorial delegation who wished to see the emperor theodosius i
although theodosius refused their requests he was irritated at the bishops presumption and refused to see him for several days
later ambrose wrote a letter to the emperor eugenius complaining that some gifts the latter had bestowed on pagan senators could be used for funding pagan cults
ambrose joins augustine jerome and gregory the great as one of the latin doctors of the church
theologians compare him with hilary who they claim fell short of ambroses administrative excellence but demonstrated greater theological ability
he succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of biblical and doctrinal subjects
ambroses intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing doctrine of the church and its sacerdotal ministry while the prevalent asceticism of the day continuing the stoic and ciceronian training of his youth enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of christian ethics
thus we have the de officiis ministrorum de viduis de virginitate and de paenitentia
ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping god and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place
his advice to augustine of hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom
when i am at rome i fast on a saturday when i am at milan i do not
follow the custom of the church where you are
thus ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the right liturgical form where there was no substantial problem
his advice has remained in the english language as the saying when in rome do as the romans do
one interpretation of ambroses writings is that he was a christian universalist
it has been noted that ambroses theology was significantly influenced by that of origen and didymus the blind two other early christian universalists
one quotation cited in favor of this belief is one could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream christian belief in a general resurrection or an allusion to purgatory
several other works by ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation
for example the jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into god and therefore have lost the grace of redemption because they reject that on which salvation depends
in de officiis the most influential of his surviving works and one of the most important texts of patristic literature he reveals his views connecting justice and generosity by asserting these practices are of mutual benefit to the participants
ambrose draws heavily on cicero and the biblical book of genesis for this concept of mutual inter dependence in society
in the bishops view it is concern for one anothers interests that binds society together
ambrose asserts that avarice leads to a breakdown in this mutuality therefore avarice leads to a breakdown in society itself
in the late s the bishop took the lead in opposing the greed of the elite landowners in milan by starting a series of pointed sermons directed at his wealthy constituents on the need for the rich to care for the poor
some scholars have suggested ambrose endeavors to lead his people as both a roman and a christian caused him to strive for what a modern context would describe as a type of communism or socialism
he was not just interested in the church but was also interested in the condition of contemporary italian society
ambrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders but a part of a united people to be stood with in solidarity
giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but a repayment of resources that god had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped
he defines justice as providing for the poor whom he describes as our brothers and sisters because they share our common humanity
the theological treatises of ambrose of milan would come to influence popes damasus siricius and leo xiii
central to ambrose is the virginity of mary and her role as mother of god
ambrose viewed celibacy as superior to marriage and saw mary as the model of virginity
ambrose studied theology with simplician a presbyter of rome
using his excellent knowledge of greek which was then rare in the west ambrose studied the old testament and greek authors like philo origen athanasius and basil of caesarea with whom he was also exchanging letters
ambrose became a famous rhetorician whom augustine came to hear speak
augustine wrote in his confessions that faustus the manichean rhetorician was a more impressive speaker but the content of ambroses sermons began to affect augustines faith
augustine sought guidance from ambrose and again records in his confessions that ambrose was too busy to answer his questions
in a passage of augustines confessions in which augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with ambrose he comments ambrose himself i esteemed a happy man as the world counted happiness because great personages held him in honor
only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden
simplician regularly met with augustine however and augustine writes of simplicians fatherly affection for him
it was simplician who introduced augustine to christian neoplatonism
it is commonly understood in the christian tradition that ambrose baptized augustine
this is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion
the practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become
in a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds in which the production of books was very labor intensive the majority of the population was illiterate and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection
however there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual
ambroses writings extend past literature and into music where he was an important innovator in early christian hymnography
his contributions include the successful invention of christian latin hymnody while the hymnologist guido maria dreves designated him to be the father of church hymnody
he was not the first to write latin hymns the bishop hilary of poitiers had done so a few decades before
however the hymns of hilary are thought to have been largely inaccessible because of their complexity and length
only fragments of hymns from hilarys liber hymnorum exist making those of ambrose the earliest extant complete latin hymns
the assembling of ambroses surviving oeuvre remains controversial the almost immediate popularity of his style quickly prompted imitations some which may even date from his lifetime
there are four hymns for which ambroses authorship is universally accepted as they are attributed to him by augustine each of these hymns has eight four line stanzas and is written in strict iambic tetrameter
marked by dignified simplicity they served as a fruitful model for later times
scholars such as the theologian brian p
dunkle have argued for the authenticity of as many as thirteen other hymns while the musicologist james mckinnon contends that further attributions could include perhaps some ten others
ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of ambrosian chant also known simply as antiphonal chant a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other
however ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the church
with augustine ambrose was traditionally credited with composing the hymn te deum
since the hymnologist guido maria dreves in however scholars have dismissed this attribution
source all works are originally in latin
following each is where it may be found in a standard compilation of ambroses writings
his first work was probably de paradiso
most have approximate dates and works such as de helia et ieiunio expositio evangelii secundum lucam and de officiis ministrorum have been given a wide variety of datings by scholars
his best known work is probably de officiis ministrorum while the and de obitu theodosii are among his most noted works
in matters of exegesis he is like hilary an alexandrian
in dogma he follows basil of caesarea and other greek authors but nevertheless gives a distinctly western cast to the speculations of which he treats
this is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human sin and divine grace and in the place which he assigns to faith in the individual christian life
there has been debate on the attribution of some writings for example de mysteriis is usually attributed to ambrose while the related de sacramentis is written in a different style with some silent disagreements so there is less consensus over its author
the history of the editions of the works of st
ambrose is a long one
erasmus edited them in four tomes at basle
a valuable roman edition was brought out in in five volumes the result of many years labour it was begun by sixtus v while yet the monk felice peretti
prefixed to it is the life of st
ambrose composed by baronius for his annales ecclesiastici
the excellent maurist edition of du frische and le nourry appeared at paris in two folio volumes it was twice reprinted at venice
the latest edition of the writings of st
ambrose is that of paolo angelo ballerini in six folio volumes
several of ambroses works have recently been published in the bilingual latin german fontes christiani series
ambracia was a city of ancient greece on the site of modern arta
it was founded by the corinthians in bc and was situated about from the ambracian gulf on a bend of the navigable river arachthos in the midst of a fertile wooded plain
ambracia was founded between and bc by gorgus son of the corinthian tyrant cypselus at which time its economy was based on farmlands fishing timber for shipbuilding and the exportation of the produce of epirus
after the expulsion of gorguss son periander its government developed into a strong democracy
the early policy of ambracia was determined by its loyalty to corinth and its consequent aversion to corcyra and corinth
ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the amphilochians and acarnanians
hence it took a prominent part in the peloponnesian war until the crushing defeat at idomene which crippled its resources
in the th century bc it continued its traditional policy but in was besieged by philip ii of macedon
with the assistance of corinth and athens it escaped complete domination at philips hands but was nevertheless forced to accept a macedonian garrison
in bc after forty three years of semi autonomy under macedonian suzerainty ambracia was given by the son of cassander to pyrrhus king of epirus who made it his capital and adorned it with palace temples and theatres
in the wars of philip v of macedon and the epirotes against the aetolian league ambracia passed from one alliance to the other but ultimately joined the latter confederacy
during the struggle of the aetolians against rome it stood a stubborn siege including the first known use of poison gas against the romans siege tunnels
ambracia was captured and plundered by marcus fulvius nobilior in bc after which it was declared by rome a free city and gradually fell into insignificance
the foundation by augustus of nicopolis into which the remaining inhabitants were drafted left the site desolate
in byzantine times a new settlement took its place under the name of arta
some fragmentary walls of large well dressed blocks near this latter town indicate the early prosperity of ambracia
amber is fossilized tree resin that has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since neolithic times
much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone amber is made into a variety of decorative objects
amber is used in jewelry and has been used as a healing agent in folk medicine
there are five classes of amber defined on the basis of their chemical constituents
because it originates as a soft sticky tree resin amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as inclusions
amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within new zealand coal seams
the english word amber derives from arabic via middle latin ambar and middle french ambre
the word referred to what is now known as ambergris a solid waxy substance derived from the sperm whale
the word in its sense of ambergris was adopted in middle english in the th century
in the romance languages the sense of the word was extended to baltic amber from as early as the late th century
at first called white or yellow amber this meaning was adopted in english by the early th century
as the use of ambergris waned this became the main sense of the word
the two substances conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches
ambergris is less dense than water and floats whereas amber is too dense to float though less dense than stone
the classical names for amber latin electrum and ancient greek are connected to a term meaning beaming sun
according to myth when phaton son of helios was killed his mourning sisters became poplar trees and their tears became elektron amber
the word elektron gave rise to the words electric electricity and their relatives because of ambers ability to bear a charge of static electricity
pliny the elder says that the german name of amber was glsum for which reason the romans when germanicus commanded the fleet in those parts gave to one of these islands the name of glsaria which by the barbarians was known as austeravia
this is confirmed by the recorded old high german word glas and by the old english word glr for amber
in middle low german amber was known as berne barn brnstn
the low german term became dominant also in high german by the th century thus modern german bernstein besides dutch barnsteen
in the baltic languages the lithuanian term for amber is gintaras and the latvian dzintars
these words and the slavic jantar and hungarian gyanta are thought to originate from phoenician jainitar
earlier pliny says that pytheas refers to a large island three days sail from the scythian coast and called balcia by xenophon of lampsacus as basilia a name generally equated with abalus
given the presence of amber the island could have been heligoland zealand the shores of gdask bay the sambia peninsula or the curonian lagoon which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern europe
it is assumed that there were well established trade routes for amber connecting the baltic with the mediterranean
pliny states explicitly that the germans exported amber to pannonia from where the veneti distributed it onwards
the ancient italic peoples of southern italy used to work amber the national archaeological museum of siritide at policoro in the province of matera displays important surviving examples
it has been suggested that amber used in antiquity as at mycenae and in the prehistory of the mediterranean came from deposits in sicily
pliny also cites the opinion of nicias according to whom amber besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is produced by the sun pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin citing the native latin name of succinum
in book section xi of natural history pliny wrote he also states that amber is also found in egypt and india and he even refers to the electrostatic properties of amber by saying that in syria the women make the whorls of their spindles of this substance and give it the name of harpax to drag from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it chaff and the light fringe of tissues
amber has a long history of use in china with the first written record from bce
early in the th century the first reports of amber found in north america came from discoveries in new jersey along crosswicks creek near trenton at camden and near woodbury
amber is heterogeneous in composition but consists of several resinous more or less soluble in alcohol ether and chloroform associated with an insoluble bituminous substance
amber is a macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family eg communic acid cummunol and biformene
these labdanes are diterpenes and trienes equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization
as amber matures over the years more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions crosslinking and cyclization
most amber has a hardness between and on the mohs scale a refractive index of a specific gravity between and and a melting point of c
heated above amber decomposes yielding an oil of amber and leaves a black residue which is known as amber colophony or amber pitch when dissolved in oil of turpentine or in linseed oil this forms amber varnish or amber lac
molecular polymerization resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment transforms the resin first into copal
sustained heat and pressure drives off terpenes and results in the formation of amber
for this to happen the resin must be resistant to decay
many trees produce resin but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes
exposure to sunlight rain microorganisms and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate the resin
for the resin to survive long enough to become amber it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them
fossil resins from europe fall into two categories the baltic ambers and another that resembles the agathis group
fossil resins from the americas and africa are closely related to the modern genus hymenaea while baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from plants of the family sciadopityaceae that once lived in north europe
the abnormal development of resin in living trees can result in the formation of amber
impurities are quite often present especially when the resin has dropped onto the ground so the material may be useless except for varnish making
such impure amber is called firniss
such inclusion of other substances can cause the amber to have an unexpected color
pyrites may give a bluish color
bony amber owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin
however so called black amber is really a kind of jet
in darkly clouded and even opaque amber inclusions can be imaged using high energy high contrast high resolution x rays
pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves and collected by hand dredging or diving
elsewhere amber is mined both in open works and underground galleries
then nodules of blue earth have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water
erosion removes this crust from sea worn amber
dominican amber is mined through bell pitting which is dangerous because of the risk of tunnel collapse
an important source of amber is kachin state in northern myanmar which has been a major source of amber in china for at least years
contemporary mining of this deposit has attracted attention for unsafe working conditions and its role in funding internal conflict in the country
amber from the rivne oblast of ukraine referred to as rivne amber is mined illegally by organised crime groups who deforest the surrounding areas and pump water into the sediments to extract the amber causing severe environmental deterioration
the vienna amber factories which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools turn it on a lathe and polish it with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil
the final luster is given by polishing with flannel
when gradually heated in an oil bath amber becomes soft and flexible
two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil heating them and then pressing them together while hot
cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil bath as the oil fills the numerous pores that cause the turbidity
small fragments formerly thrown away or used only for varnish are now used on a large scale in the formation of ambroid or pressed amber
the pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate
the product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking
this pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light
amber has often been imitated by other resins like copal and kauri gum as well as by celluloid and even glass
baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially but also called true amber
amber occurs in a range of different colors
as well as the usual yellow orange brown that is associated with the color amber amber can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow to brown and almost black
other uncommon colors include red amber green amber and even blue amber which is rare and highly sought after
yellow amber is a hard fossil resin from evergreen trees and despite the name it can be translucent yellow orange or brown colored
known to the iranians by the pahlavi compound word kah ruba which entered arabic as kahraba or kahraba it too was called amber in europe
found along the southern shore of the baltic sea yellow amber reached the middle east and western europe via trade
its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris
moreover like ambergris the resin could be burned as an incense
the resins most popular use was however for ornamentation easily cut and polished it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry
much of the most highly prized amber is transparent in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber
opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles
this kind of amber is known as bony amber
although all dominican amber is fluorescent the rarest dominican amber is blue amber
it turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly ultraviolet light source
in long wave uv light it has a very strong reflection almost white
only about is found per year which makes it valuable and expensive
sometimes amber retains the form of drops and stalactites just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees
it is thought that in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form
amber can be classified into several forms
most fundamentally there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization
terpenoids produced by conifers and angiosperms consist of ring structures formed of isoprene units
phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms and tend to serve functional uses
the extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin which is often found as amber within their veins
the composition of resins is highly variable each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry
the overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes
there is also a separate classification of amber gemstones according to the way of production
this class is by far the most abundant
it comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids
it is further split into three sub classes
classes ia and ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes while ic uses enantio labdanoids
class ia includes succinite and glessite
they have a communic acid base and they also include much succinic acid
baltic amber yields on dry distillation succinic acid the proportion varying from about to and being greatest in the pale opaque or bony varieties
the aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly from this acid
baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid hence the name succinite
succinite has a hardness between and which is greater than many other fossil resins
its specific gravity varies from to
it can be distinguished from other ambers via infrared spectroscopy through a specific carbonyl absorption peak
infrared spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample
succinic acid may not be an original component of amber but rather a degradation product of abietic acid
class ib ambers are based on communic acid however they lack succinic acid
class ic is mainly based on enantio labdatrienonic acids such as ozic and zanzibaric acids
its most familiar representative is dominican amber
which is mostly transparent and often contains a higher number of fossil inclusions
this has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long vanished tropical forest
resin from the extinct species hymenaea protera is the source of dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics
it is not succinite but retinite
these ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base such as cadinene
these ambers are polystyrenes
class iv is something of a catch all its ambers are not polymerized but mainly consist of cedrene based sesquiterpenoids
class v resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative
they comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and n alkyl compounds
their main variety is highgate copalite
the oldest amber recovered dates to the late carboniferous period
its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers it is most similar to the resins produced by flowering plants however there are no flowering plant fossils known from before the cretaceous and they were not common until the late cretaceous
amber becomes abundant long after the carboniferous in the early cretaceous when it is found in association with insects
the oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the late triassic of italy where four microscopic mites triasacarus ampezzoa minyacarus and cheirolepidoptus and a poorly preserved nematoceran fly were found in millimetre sized droplets of amber
the oldest amber with significant numbers of arthropod inclusions comes from lebanon
this amber referred to as lebanese amber is roughly million years old is considered of high scientific value providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled ecosystems
in lebanon more than outcrops of lower cretaceous amber were discovered by dany azar a lebanese paleontologist and entomologist
among these outcrops have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods
even older jurassic amber has been found recently in lebanon as well
many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of jordan including the oldest zorapterans clerid beetles umenocoleid roaches and achiliid planthoppers
burmese amber from the hukawng valley in northern myanmar is the only commercially exploited cretaceous amber
uranium lead dating of zircon crystals associated with the deposit have given an estimated depositional age of approximately million years ago
over species have been described from the amber with over in alone
baltic amber is found as irregular nodules in marine glauconitic sand known as blue earth occurring in upper eocene strata of sambia in prussia
it appears to have been partly derived from older eocene deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations such as glacial drift
relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh suggesting relations with the flora of eastern asia and the southern part of north america
heinrich gppert named the common amber yielding pine of the baltic forests pinites succiniter but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called pinus succinifera
it is improbable that the production of amber was limited to a single species and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber flora
amber is a unique preservational mode preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms the chemical composition of the resin however is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer
amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted
insects spiders and even their webs annelids frogs crustaceans bacteria and amoebae marine microfossils wood flowers and fruit hair feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in cretaceous ambers
the preservation of prehistoric organisms in amber forms a key plot point in michael crichtons novel jurassic park and the movie adaptation by steven spielberg
in the story scientists are able to extract the preserved blood of dinosaurs from prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber from which they genetically clone living dinosaurs
scientifically this is as yet impossible since no amber with fossilized mosquitoes has ever yielded preserved blood
amber is however conducive to preserving dna since it dehydrates and thus stabilizes organisms trapped inside
one projection in estimated that dna trapped in amber could last up to million years far beyond most estimates of around million years in the most ideal conditions although a later study was unable to extract dna from insects trapped in much more recent holocene copal
in year old david attenborough was given a piece of amber containing prehistoric creatures from his adoptive sister it would be the focus of his bbc documentary the amber time machine
amber has been used since prehistory in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments and also in folk medicine
amber has been used as jewelry since the stone age from years ago
amber ornaments have been found in mycenaean tombs and elsewhere across europe
to this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces
ambers place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value palanga amber museum is dedicated to the fossilized resin
amber has long been used in folk medicine for its purported healing properties
amber and extracts were used from the time of hippocrates in ancient greece for a wide variety of treatments through the middle ages and up until the early twentieth century
traditional chinese medicine uses amber to tranquilize the mind
amber necklaces are a traditional european remedy for colic or teething pain with purported analgesic properties of succinic acid although there is no evidence that this is an effective remedy or delivery method
the american academy of pediatrics and the fda have warned strongly against their use as they present both a choking and a strangulation hazard
in ancient china it was customary to burn amber during large festivities
if amber is heated under the right conditions oil of amber is produced and in past times this was combined carefully with nitric acid to create artificial musk a resin with a peculiar musky odor
although when burned amber does give off a characteristic pinewood fragrance modern products such as perfume do not normally use actual amber because fossilized amber produces very little scent
in perfumery scents referred to as amber are often created and patented to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil
the scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and or the plant resin labdanum but since sperm whales are endangered the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum
the term amber is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm musky rich and honey like and also somewhat earthy
benzoin is usually part of the recipe
vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma
amber perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum benzoin resin copal vanilla dammara resin and or synthetic materials
in arab muslim tradition popular scents include amber jasmine musk and oud
amalaric was king of the visigoths from until his death in battle in
he was a son of king alaric ii and his first wife theodegotha daughter of theoderic the great
when alaric ii was killed while fighting clovis i king of the franks in the battle of vouill his kingdom fell into disarray
more serious than the destruction of the gothic army writes herwig wolfram than the loss of both aquitanian provinces and the capital of toulose was the death of the king
alaric had made no provision for a successor and although he had two sons one was of age but illegitimate and the other amalaric the offspring of a legal marriage but still a child
amalaric was carried for safety into spain which country and provence were thenceforth ruled by his maternal grandfather theodoric the great acting through his vice regent an ostrogothic nobleman named theudis
the older son gesalec was chosen as king but his reign was disastrous
king theoderic of the ostrogoths sent an army led by his sword bearer theudis against gesalec ostensibly on behalf of amalaric gesalec fled to africa
the ostrogoths then drove back the franks and their burgundian allies regaining possession of the south of novempopulana rodez probably even albi and even toulose
following the death of clovis theoderic negotiated a peace with clovis successors securing visigothic control of the southernmost portion of gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom
in the young amalaric was proclaimed king and four years later on theoderics death he assumed full royal power although relinquishing provence to his cousin athalaric
his kingdom was faced with a frankish threat from the north according to peter heather this was his motivation for marrying chrotilda the daughter of clovis
however this was not successful for according to gregory of tours amalaric pressured her to forsake orthodoxy and convert to arian christianity at one point beating her until she bled she sent to her brother childebert i king of paris a towel stained with her own blood
it is worth noting ian woods advice that although gregory provides the fullest information for this period where it touches merovingian affairs he often allowed his religious bias to determine his interpretation of the events
peter heather agrees with woods implication in this instance i doubt that this is the full story but the effects of frankish intervention are clear enough
childebert defeated the visigothic army and took narbonne
amalaric fled south to barcelona where according to isidore of seville he was assassinated by his own men
according to peter heather theoderics former governor theudis was implicated in amalarics murder and was certainly its prime beneficiary
as for chrotilda in gregorys words she died on the journey home by some ill chance
childebert had her body brought to paris where she was buried alongside her father clovis
the alphorn or alpenhorn or alpine horn is a labrophone consisting of a straight several meter long wooden natural horn of conical bore with a wooden cup shaped mouthpiece
traditionally the alphorn was made of one single piece or two parts at most and made from the wood of a red pine tree
sometimes the trees would bend from the weight of snow during the wintertime and this caused them to have the larger and bent mouthpiece at their ends
modern alphorns are sometimes made from three distinct parts that can be stuck together this is to make them easier to transport via automobile or even carried by hand and today are more frequently made from the wood of a spruce tree or fir tree
it is used by mountain dwellers in the swiss alps
similar wooden horns were used for communication in most mountainous regions of europe from the alps to the carpathians
alphorns are today used as musical instruments
for a long time scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the roman etruscan lituus because of their resemblance in shape and because of the word liti meaning alphorn in the dialect of obwalden
there is no documented evidence for this theory however and also the word liti was probably borrowed from th th century writings in latin where the word lituus could describe various wind instruments such as the horn the crumhorn or the cornett
swiss naturalist conrad gesner used the words lituum alpinum for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his de raris et admirandis herbis in
the oldest known document using the german word alphorn is a page from a account book from the former cistercian abbey st
urban near pfaffnau mentioning the payment of two batzen for an itinerant alphorn player from the valais
th th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since old times or earlier sometimes substituting for the lack of church bells
surviving artifacts dating back to as far as ca
ad include wooden labrophones in their stretched form like the alphorn or coiled versions such as the bchel and the allguisches waldhorn or ackerhorn
the alphorns exact origins remain indeterminate and the ubiquity of horn like signal instruments in valleys throughout europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage
the alphorn is carved from solid softwood generally spruce but sometimes pine
in former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn but modern makers piece the wood together at the base
a cup shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete
an alphorn made at rigi kulm schwyz and now in the victoria and albert museum measures in length and has a straight tube
the swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality being curved near the bell in the bernese oberland
michael praetorius mentions an alphorn like instrument under the name of hlzern trummet in syntagma musicum
the alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure natural harmonic series of the open pipe
the notes of the natural harmonic series overlap but do not exactly correspond to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard western equal temperament
most prominently within the alphorns range the th and th harmonics are particularly noticeable because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale
accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves consisting of the nd through the th notes of the harmonic series
the availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn
the well known ranz des vaches is a traditional swiss melody often heard on the alphorn
the song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at milk making time
rossini introduced the ranz des vaches into his masterpiece william tell along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well suited to the alphorn
brahms wrote to clara schumann that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his first symphony was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the rigi area of switzerland
for claras birthday in brahms sent her a greeting that was to be sung with the melody
an army ground force or land force is an armed force that fights primarily on land
in the broadest sense it is the land based military branch service branch or armed service of a nation or country
it may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component
within a national military force the word army may also mean a field army
in some countries such as france and china the term army especially in its plural form armies has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces
to differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force the term is qualified for example in france the land force is called meaning land army and the air and space force is called arme de lair et de lespace meaning air and space army
the naval force although not using the term army is also included in the broad sense of the term armies thus the french navy is an integral component of the collective french armies under the ministry of the armies
a similar pattern is seen in china with the peoples liberation army being the overall military the land force being the pla ground force and so forth for the pla air force the pla navy and other branches
by convention irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia
regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines uniforms organizations etc
regular military can also refer to full time status versus reserve or part time personnel
other distinctions may separate statutory forces from de facto non statutory forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies
armies may also be expeditionary or fencible
armies are always divided into various specialties according to the mission role and training of individual units and sometimes individual soldiers within a unit
indias armies were among the first in the world
in the first recorded battle the battle of the ten kings a hindu aryan king named sudas defeated an alliance of ten kings and their supportive chieftains
during the iron age the maurya and nanda empires had the largest armies in the world the peak being approximately over infantry cavalry war chariots and war elephants not including tributary state allies
in the gupta age large armies of longbowmen were recruited to fight off invading horse archer armies
elephants pikemen and cavalry were other featured troops
in rajput times the main piece of equipment was iron or chain mail armor a round shield either a curved blade or a straight sword a chakra disc and a katar dagger
the states of china raised armies for at least years before the spring and autumn annals
by the warring states period the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret with bronze bolts that could pierce any armor
thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization
china underwent political consolidation of the states of han wei chu yan zhao and qi until by bce qin shi huang the first emperor of the qin dynasty attained absolute power
this first emperor of china could command the creation of a terracotta army to guard his tomb in the city of xian as well as a realignment of the great wall of china to strengthen his empire against insurrection invasion and incursion
sun tzus the art of war remains one of chinas seven military classics even though it is two thousand years old
since no political figure could exist without an army measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies
civil bureaucracies arose to control the productive power of the states and their military power
the spartan army was one of the earliest known professional armies
boys were sent to a barracks at the age of seven or eight to train for becoming a soldier
at the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family
after that men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of
the spartan army was largely composed of hoplites equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other
each hoplite bore the spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform
the main pieces of this armor were a round shield a spear and a helmet
the roman army had its origins in the citizen army of the republic which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for rome
reforms turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens but these citizens served continuously for years before being discharged
the romans were also noted for making use of auxiliary troops non romans who served with the legions and filled roles that the traditional roman military could not fill effectively such as light skirmish troops and heavy cavalry
after their service in the army they were made citizens of rome and then their children were citizens also
they were also given land and money to settle in rome
in the late roman empire these auxiliary troops along with foreign mercenaries became the core of the roman army moreover by the time of the late roman empire tribes such as the visigoths were paid to serve as mercenaries
in the earliest middle ages it was the obligation of every aristocrat to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment archers and infantry
this decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time but could lead to motley forces with variable training equipment and abilities
the more resources the noble had access to the better his troops would be
initially the words knight and noble were used interchangeably as there was not generally a distinction between them
while the nobility did fight upon horseback they were also supported by lower class citizens and mercenaries and criminals whose only purpose was participating in warfare because most often than not they held brief employment during their lords engagement
as the middle ages progressed and feudalism developed in a legitimate social and economic system knights started to develop into their own class with a minor caveat they were still in debt to their lord
no longer primarily driven by economic need the newly established vassal class were instead driven by fealty and chivalry
as central governments grew in power a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began as central levies of the peasantry began to be the central recruiting tool
england was one of the most centralized states in the middle ages and the armies that fought in the hundred years war were predominantly composed of paid professionals
in theory every englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days
forty days was not long enough for a campaign especially one on the continent
thus the scutage was introduced whereby most englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army
however almost all high medieval armies in europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops and there was a large mercenary market in europe from at least the early th century
as the middle ages progressed in italy italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region
these would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate
mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers especially in combination with standing forces but in italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states
this made them considerably less reliable than a standing army
mercenary on mercenary warfare in italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles
in the french legislature known as the estates general passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone
there was a new tax to be raised known as the taille that was to provide funding for a new royal army
the mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the royal army as compagnies dordonnance on a permanent basis or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused
france gained a total standing army of around men which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own
the new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors
the reforms of the s eventually led to the french victory at castillon in and the conclusion of the hundred years war
by the companies were divided into the field army known as the grande ordonnance and the garrison force known as the petite ordonnance
first nation states lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces so they tended to hire mercenaries to serve in their armies during wartime
such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict when men at arms were no longer needed by their respective governments
the veteran soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment often becoming mercenaries
free companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia
as late as the s most troops were mercenaries
however after the th century most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops
for a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators but soon these tasks were also taken by the state
the massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators
the newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state
the combination of increased taxes and increased centralization of government functions caused a series of revolts across europe such as the fronde in france and the english civil war
in many countries the resolution of this conflict was the rise of absolute monarchy
only in england and the netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative
from the late th century states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions
the first state to master this process was the dutch republic
this transformation in the armies of europe had great social impact
the defense of the state now rested on the commoners not on the aristocrats
however aristocrats continued to monopolize the officer corps of almost all early modern armies including their high command
moreover popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes
the new armies because of their vast expense were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society
the great commercial powers of the dutch and english matched much larger states in military might
as any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket it became far easier to form massive armies
the inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers
this led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies
for the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat rather than just the highly skilled professionals
it has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism and during this period the modern notion of the nation state was born
however this would only become apparent after the french revolutionary wars
at this time the leve en masse and conscription would become the defining paradigm of modern warfare
before then however most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities
in spain armies were recruited from all the spanish european territories including spain italy wallonia and germany
the french recruited some soldiers from germany switzerland as well as from piedmont
britain recruited hessian and hanovrian troops until the late th century
irish catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many catholic european states
prior to the english civil war in england the monarch maintained a personal bodyguard of yeomen of the guard and the honourable corps of gentlemen at arms or gentlemen pensioners and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as berwick on tweed or portsmouth
troops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an ad hoc basis
noblemen and professional regular soldiers were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops raising their quotas by indenture from a variety of sources
on january charles ii issued the royal warrant that created the genesis of what would become the british army although the scottish and english armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of england and scotland in
the small force was represented by only a few regiments
after the american revolutionary war the continental army was quickly disbanded as part of the americans distrust of standing armies and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the united states with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding west points arsenal
then first american regiment was established in
however because of continuing conflict with native americans it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army
the first of these the legion of the united states was established in
until the common soldiers of prussian army consisted largely of peasantry recruited or impressed from brandenburg prussia leading many to flee to neighboring countries
to halt this trend frederick william i divided prussia into regimental cantons
every youth was required to serve as a soldier in these recruitment districts for three months each year this met agrarian needs and added extra troops to bolster the regular ranks
russian tsars before peter i of russia maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps that were highly unreliable and undisciplined
in times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants
peter i introduced a modern regular army built on german model but with a new aspect officers not necessarily from nobility as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officers rank
conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system per settlement
initially it was based on the number of households later it was based on the population numbers
the term of service in the th century was for life
in it was reduced to years
in it was reduced to years plus years in reserve and in to years plus years of reserve
the first ottoman standing army were janissaries
they replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted
the first janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one fifth share of his armys booty in kind rather than cash
from the s onwards their ranks were filled under the devirme system where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan
the recruits were mostly christian youths reminiscent of mamluks
china organized the manchu people into the eight banner system in the early th century
defected ming armies formed the green standard army
these troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service
conscription allowed the french republic to form the grande arme what napoleon bonaparte called the nation in arms which successfully battled european professional armies
conscription particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies
in developed nations the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better trained fighting forces make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future
russia as well as many other nations retains mainly a conscript army
there is also a very rare citizen army as used in switzerland
a particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general
for example the first united states army and the army of northern virginia
in the british army it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army whereas lower formations use figures
armies are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size composition and scope of responsibility
in the soviet red army and the soviet air force armies could vary in size but were subordinate to an army group sized front in wartime
in peacetime a soviet army was usually subordinate to a military district
viktor suvorovs inside the soviet army describes how cold war era soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co located for administration and deception reasons
the family alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators caimans and their extinct relatives
the superfamily alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians that are more closely related to the american alligator than to either the nile crocodile or the gharial
this is a stem based definition for alligators and is more inclusive than the crown group alligatoridae
as a crown group alligatoridae only includes the last common ancestor of all extant alligators caimans and their descendants whereas alligatoroidea as a stem based group also includes more basal extinct alligator ancestors that are more closely related to living alligators than to crocodiles or gavialids
when considering only living taxa this makes alligatoroidea and alligatoridae redundant
the simplified cladogram below shows alligatoridaes relationships to other extant crocodilians
the below detailed cladogram shows one proposal for the internal relationships within alligatoridae
the superfamily alligatoroidea is thought to have split from the crocodile gharial lineage in the late cretaceous about million years ago
leidyosuchus of alberta is the earliest known genus
fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout eurasia as land bridges across both the north atlantic and the bering strait have connected north america to eurasia during the cretaceous paleogene and neogene periods
alligators and caimans split in north america during the early tertiary or late cretaceous and the latter reached south america by the paleogene before the closure of the isthmus of panama during the neogene period
the chinese alligator split from the american alligator about million years ago and likely descended from a lineage that crossed the bering land bridge during the neogene
the modern american alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the pleistocene
the alligators full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the s
the full genome published in suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds
the lineage including alligators proper occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the upper chalk in europe where they did not die out until the pliocene age
the true alligators are today represented by two species a
mississippiensis in the southeastern united states which can grow to ft and weigh lbs with unverified sizes of up to ft
and the small a
sinensis in the yangtze river china which grows to an average of ft
their name derives from the spanish el lagarto which means the lizard
in central and south america the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily caimaninae which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture
besides the three species in caiman the smooth fronted caimans in genus paleosuchus and the black caiman in melanosuchus are described
caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile like in their movements and have longer sharper teeth than alligators
crocodilus the spectacled caiman has the widest distribution from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina and grows to a modest size of about
the largest is the near threatened melanosuchus niger the jacar au or large or black caiman of the amazon river basin
black caimans grow to with the unverified size of up to
the black caiman and american alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family
although caimans have not been studied in depth scientists have learned their mating cycles are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels which increases chances of survival for their offspring
extinct alders are trees comprising the genus alnus in the birch family betulaceae
the genus comprises about species of monoecious trees and shrubs a few reaching a large size distributed throughout the north temperate zone with a few species extending into central america as well as the northern and southern andes
with a few exceptions alders are deciduous and the leaves are alternate simple and serrated
the flowers are catkins with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins often before leaves appear they are mainly wind pollinated but also visited by bees to a small extent
these trees differ from the birches in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many conifer cones
the largest species are red alder on the west coast of north america and black alder native to most of europe and widely introduced elsewhere both reaching over
by contrast the widespread alnus alnobetula is rarely more than a shrub
the oldest fossil pollen that can be identified as alnus is from northern bohemia dating to the late paleocene around million years ago
the common name alder evolved from the old english word alor which in turn is derived from proto germanic root aliso
the generic name alnus is the equivalent latin name from whence french aulne and spanish alamo
alders are commonly found near streams rivers and wetlands
sometimes where the prevalence of alders is particularly prominent these are called alder carrs
in the pacific northwest of north america the white alder unlike other northwest alders has an affinity for warm dry climates where it grows along watercourses such as along the lower columbia river east of the cascades and the snake river including hells canyon
alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous butterflies and moths
glutinosa and a
viridis are classed as environmental weeds in new zealand
alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients
alder is particularly noted for its important symbiotic relationship with frankia alni an actinomycete filamentous nitrogen fixing bacterium
this bacterium is found in root nodules which may be as large as a human fist with many small lobes and light brown in colour
the bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and makes it available to the tree
alder in turn provides the bacterium with sugars which it produces through photosynthesis
as a result of this mutually beneficial relationship alder improves the fertility of the soil where it grows and as a pioneer species it helps provide additional nitrogen for the successional species to follow
because of its abundance red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils
red alder stands have been found to supply between of nitrogen annually to the soil
from alaska to oregon alnus viridis subsp
sinuata characteristically pioneer fresh gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers
studies show that sitka alder a more shrubby variety of alder adds nitrogen to the soil at an average rate of per year helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest
alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods windstorms fires landslides etc
alder groves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers
their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires
in addition the light weight of alder seedsnumbering allows for easy dispersal by the wind
although it outgrows coastal douglas fir for the first years it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than years
red alder is the pacific northwests largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad leaved tree in the coastal northwest
groves of red alder in diameter intermingle with young douglas fir forests west of the cascades attaining a maximum height of in about sixty years and then are afflicted by heart rot
alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them
alder roots are parasitized by northern groundcone
the catkins of some alder species have a degree of edibility and may be rich in protein
reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste they are more useful for survival purposes
the wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items such as coffee salmon and other seafood
most of the pilings that form the foundation of venice were made from alder trees
alder bark contains the anti inflammatory salicin which is metabolized into salicylic acid in the body
some native american cultures use red alder bark to treat poison oak insect bites and skin irritations
blackfeet indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis
recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains betulin and lupeol compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors
the inner bark of the alder as well as red osier dogwood or chokecherry is used by some indigenous peoples of the americas in smoking mixtures known as kinnikinnick to improve the taste of the bearberry leaf
alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the austrian town of grossarl
electric guitars most notably those manufactured by the fender musical instruments corporation have been built with alder bodies since the s
alder is appreciated for its tone that is claimed to be tight and evenly balanced especially when compared to mahogany and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers
as a hardwood alder is used in making furniture cabinets and other woodworking products
alder bark and wood contain tannin and are traditionally used to tan leather
a red dye can also be extracted from the outer bark and a yellow dye from the inner bark
ermanno olmis movie the tree of wooden clogs refers in its title to alder typically used to make clogs as in this movies plot
amos bronson alcott was an american teacher writer philosopher and reformer
as an educator alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students focusing on a conversational style and avoided traditional punishment
he hoped to perfect the human spirit and to that end advocated a plant based diet
he was also an abolitionist and an advocate for womens rights
born in wolcott connecticut in alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman
worried that the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul he turned to teaching
his innovative methods however were controversial and he rarely stayed in one place very long
his most well known teaching position was at the temple school in boston
his experience there was turned into two books records of a school and conversations with children on the gospels
alcott became friends with ralph waldo emerson and became a major figure in transcendentalism
his writings on behalf of that movement however are heavily criticized for being incoherent
based on his ideas for human perfection alcott founded fruitlands a transcendentalist experiment in community living
the project failed after seven months
alcott and his family struggled financially for most of his life
nevertheless he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in
he died in
alcott married abby may in and they had four surviving children all daughters
their second was louisa may who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel little women in
a native new englander amos bronson alcott was born in wolcott connecticut on november
his parents were joseph chatfield alcott and anna bronson alcott
the family home was in an area known as spindle hill and his father joseph alcox traced his ancestry to colonial era settlers in eastern massachusetts
the family originally spelled their name alcock later changed to alcocke then alcox
amos bronson the oldest of eight children later changed the spelling to alcott and dropped his first name
at age six young bronson began his formal education in a one room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother
the school taught only reading writing and spelling and he left this school at the age of
at age his uncle reverend tillotson bronson invited alcott into his home in cheshire connecticut to be educated and prepared for college
bronson gave it up after only a month and was self educated from then on
he was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin william alcott with whom he shared books and ideas
bronson alcott later reflected on his childhood at spindle hill it kept me pure
i dwelt amidst the hills
god spoke to me while i walked the fields
starting at age he worked for clockmaker seth thomas in the nearby town of plymouth
at age alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher
instead he left home and became a traveling salesman in the american south peddling books and merchandise
he hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents to make their cares and burdens less
and get them free from debt though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit
at first he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well being
in march alcott wrote to his brother peddling is a hard place to serve god but a capital one to serve mammon
near the end of his life he fictionalized this experience in his book new connecticut originally circulated only among friends before its publication in
by the summer of alcott returned to connecticut in debt to his father who had bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips
he took a job as a schoolteacher in cheshire with the help of his uncle tillotson
he quickly set about reforming the school
he added backs to the benches on which students sat improved lighting and heating de emphasized rote learning and provided individual slates to each student paid for by himself
alcott had been influenced by educational philosophy of the swiss pedagogue johann heinrich pestalozzi and even renamed his school the cheshire pestalozzi school
his style attracted the attention of samuel joseph may who introduced alcott to his sister abby may
she called him an intelligent philosophic modest man and found his views on education very attractive
locals in cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods
many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently reopened private school for boys
on november alcott started teaching in bristol connecticut still using the same methods he used in cheshire but opposition from the community surfaced quickly he was unemployed by march
he moved to boston on april and was immediately impressed referring to the city as a place where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen
he opened the salem street infant school two months later on june
abby may applied as his teaching assistant instead the couple were engaged without consent of the family
they were married at kings chapel on may he was years old and she was
her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her fathers house
after their marriage the alcotts moved to franklin street in boston a boarding house run by a mrs newall
around this time alcott also first expressed his public disdain for slavery
in november he and william lloyd garrison founded what he later called a preliminary anti slavery society though he differed from garrison as a nonresistant
alcott became a member of the boston vigilance committee
attendance at alcotts school was falling when a wealthy quaker named reuben haines iii proposed that he and educator william russell start a new school in pennsylvania associated with the germantown academy
alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on december
the school was established in germantown and the alcotts were offered a rent free home by haines
alcott and russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby philadelphia instead
unsuccessful they went back to germantown though the rent free home was no longer available and the alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding house
it was there that their first child a daughter they named anna bronson alcott was born on march after hours of labor
by the fall of that year their benefactor haines died suddenly and the alcotts again suffered financial difficulty
we hardly earn the bread wrote abby may to her brother the butter we have to think about
the couples only son was born on april but lived only a few minutes
the mother recorded gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living
it was in germantown that the couples second daughter was born
louisa may alcott was born on her fathers birthday november at a half hour past midnight
bronson described her as a very fine healthful child much more so than anna was at birth
the germantown school however was faltering soon only eight pupils remained
their benefactor haines died before louisas birth
he had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them
as abby wrote his death has prostrated all our hopes here
on april the family moved to philadelphia where alcott ran a day school
as usual alcotts methods were controversial a former student later referred to him as the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind
alcott began to believe boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish
he contacted theologian william ellery channing for support
channing approved of alcotts methods and promised to help find students to enroll including his daughter mary
channing also secured aid from justice lemuel shaw and boston mayor josiah quincy jr on september alcott opened a school of about students mostly from wealthy families
it was named the temple school because classes were held at the masonic temple on tremont street in boston
his assistant was elizabeth palmer peabody later replaced by margaret fuller
mary peabody mann served as a french instructor for a time
the school was briefly famous and then infamous because of alcotts method of discarding text books and teaching by conversation his questioning attitude toward the bible and his reception of a colored girl into his classes
before primary and secondary teaching of writing consisted of rote drills in grammar spelling vocabulary penmanship and transcription of adult texts
in that decade however progressive reformers such as alcott influenced by pestalozzi friedrich frbel and johann friedrich herbart began to advocate compositions based on students own experiences
these reformers opposed beginning instruction with rules and preferred to have students learn to write by expressing their personal understanding of the events of their lives
alcott sought to develop instruction on the basis of self analysis with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill
a similar interest in instructive conversation was shared by abby may who describing her idea of a family post office set up to curb potential domestic tension said i thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children indeed all of us to interchange thought and sentiment
alongside writing and reading alcott gave lessons in spiritual culture which included interpretation of the gospels and advocated object teaching in writing instruction
he even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning paintings books comfortable furniture and busts or portraits of plato socrates jesus and william ellery channing
during this time the alcotts had another child
born on june she was named elizabeth peabody alcott in honor of the teaching assistant at the temple school
by age three however her mother changed her name to elizabeth sewall alcott after her own mother perhaps because of the recent rupture between bronson alcott and elizabeth palmer peabody
in july peabody published her account as an assistant to the temple school as record of a school exemplifying the general principles of spiritual culture
while working on a second book alcott and peabody had a falling out and conversations with children on the gospels was prepared with help from peabodys sister sophia published at the end of december
alcotts methods were not well received many found his conversations on the gospels close to blasphemous
for example he asked students to question if biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of god
in the boston daily advertiser nathan hale criticized alcotts flippant and off hand conversation about serious topics from the virgin birth of jesus to circumcision
joseph t
buckingham called alcott either insane or half witted and an ignorant and presuming charlatan
the book did not sell well a boston lawyer bought copies to use as waste paper
the temple school was widely denounced in the press
reverend james freeman clarke was one of alcotts few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from boston periodicals
alcott was rejected by most public opinion and by the summer of he had only students left and no assistant after margaret fuller moved to providence rhode island
the controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and as the school closed alcott became increasingly financially desperate
remaining steadfast to his pedagogy a forerunner of progressive and democratic schooling he alienated parents in a later parlor school by admitting an african american child to the class whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests
beginning in alcotts membership in the transcendental club put him in the company of such as ralph waldo emerson orestes brownson and theodore parker
he became a member at the clubs second meeting and hosted its third
a biographer of emerson described the group as the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers agreeing in nothing but their liberality
frederic henry hedge wrote similarly that here was no club in the strict sense
only occasional meetings of like minded men and women
alcott preferred the term symposium for their group
in late april alcott moved to the town of concord urged by emerson
he rented a home for a year within walking distance of emersons house
he named it dove cottage
a supporter of his philosophies emerson offered to help alcott with his writing
this proved a difficult task
for example after several revisions of the essay psyche emerson deemed it unpublishable
alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of german writer johann wolfgang von goethe which was published in the transcendentalists journal the dial
emerson had written to margaret fuller then editor that alcotts so called orphic sayings might pass muster even pass for just great but they were widely mocked as silly and unintelligible
fuller herself disliked them but did not want to hurt alcotts feelings
the following example appeared in the first issue with financial support from emerson and leaving his family in the care of his brother junius alcott departed concord for a visit to england on may
there he met admirers charles lane and henry c
wright supporters of alcott house an experimental school outside london based on alcotts temple school methods
the two men followed alcott back to the united states and in an early communitarian experiment lane and his son moved in with the alcotts
persuaded in part by lanes abolitionist views alcott took a stand against president tylers plan to annex texas as a slave territory and refused to pay his poll tax
abby may wrote in her journal on january a day of some excitement as mr alcott refused to pay his town tax
after waiting some time to be committed jail he was told it was paid by a friend
thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles
the incident inspired henry david thoreau whose similar protest against the poll tax led to a night in jail and his essay civil disobedience
lane and alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a utopian society
alcott however was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community
in a letter lane wrote i do not see anyone to act the money part but myself
in may he purchased a farm in harvard massachusetts
up front he paid of the total value of the property the rest was meant to be paid by the alcotts over a two year period
they moved to the farm on june and optimistically named it fruitlands despite only ten old apple trees on the property
in july alcott announced their plans in the dial we have made an arrangement with the proprietor of an estate of about a hundred acres which liberates this tract from human ownership
their goal was to regain eden to find the formula for agriculture diet and reproduction that would provide the perfect way for the individual to live in harmony with nature the animal world his fellows himself his creator
in order to achieve this they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently styling themselves a consociate family
unlike a similar project named brook farm the participants at fruitlands avoided interaction with other local communities
at first scorning animal labor as exploitative they found human spadework insufficient to their needs and eventually allowed some cattle to be enslaved
they banned coffee tea alcoholic drinks milk and warm bathwater
as alcott had published earlier our wine is water flesh bread drugs fruits
one member samuel bower gave the community the reputation of refusing to eat potatoes because instead of aspiring toward the sky they grew downward in the earth for clothing they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it as well as cotton silk and wool because they were products of slave labor
alcott had high expectations but was often away attempting to recruit more members when the community most needed him
the experimental community was never successful partly because most of the land was not arable
alcott lamented none of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed
so we fell apart
its founders were often away as well in the middle of harvesting they left for a lecture tour through providence rhode island new york city and new haven connecticut
in its seven months only people joined included the alcotts and lanes
other than abby may and her daughters only one other woman joined ann page
one rumor is that page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor
lane believed alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the nuclear family
he quit the project and moved to a nearby shaker family with his son
after lanes departure alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days
abby may thought lane purposely sabotaged her family
she wrote to her brother all mr lanes efforts have been to disunite us
but mr alcotts
paternal instincts were too strong for him
when the final payment on the farm was owed sam may refused to cover his brother in laws debts as he often did possibly at abby mays suggestion
the experiment failed the alcotts had to leave fruitlands
the members of the alcott family were not happy with their fruitlands experience
at one point abby may threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere leaving bronson behind
louisa may alcott who was ten years old at the time later wrote of the experience in transcendental wild oats the band of brothers began by spading garden and field but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly
in january alcott moved his family to still river a village within harvard but on march the family returned to concord to live in a home they named the hillside
both emerson and sam may assisted in securing the home for the alcotts
while living in the home louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room
she later said her years at the home were the happiest years of her life many of the incidents in her novel little women are based on this period
alcott renovated the property moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color as well as tending to over six acres of land
on may abby may was granted a sum from her fathers estate which was put into a trust fund granting minor financial security
that summer bronson alcott let henry david thoreau borrow his ax to prepare his home at walden pond
the alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at the hillside including fugitive slaves which they hosted in secret as a station of the underground railroad
alcotts opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the mexican american war which began in
he considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of a people bent on conquest on getting the golden treasures of mexico into our hands and of subjugating foreign peoples in abby may insisted they leave concord which she called cold heartless brainless soulless
the alcott family put the hillside up for rent and moved to boston
there next door to peabodys book store on west street bronson alcott hosted a series based on the conversations model by margaret fuller called a course on the conversations on man his history resources and expectations
participants both men and women were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures
in march alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at harvard divinity school in an extracurricular non credit course
alcott and his family moved back to concord after where he and his family lived in the orchard house until
in alcott was named superintendent of concord schools
alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in
in his journal for november he wrote at town house and cast my vote for lincoln and the republican candidates generally the first vote i ever cast for a president and state officers
alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical william lloyd garrison
he had attended a rally led by wendell phillips on behalf of year old thomas sims a fugitive slave on trial in boston
alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse when gunshots were heard he was the only one who stood his ground though the effort was unsuccessful
he had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of anthony burns
a group had broken down the door of the boston courthouse but guards beat them back
alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group thomas wentworth higginson why are we not within he then walked calmly into the courthouse was threatened with a gun and turned back but without hastening a step according to higginson
in louisa moved to washington dc to volunteer as a nurse
on january the alcotts received a telegram that louisa was sick bronson immediately went to bring her home briefly meeting abraham lincoln while there
louisa turned her experience into the book hospital sketches
her father wrote of it i see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of louisas merits as a woman and a writer
henry david thoreau died on may likely from an illness he caught from alcott two years earlier
at emersons request alcott helped arrange thoreaus funeral which was held at first parish sanctuary in concord despite thoreau having disavowed membership in the church when he was in his early twenties
emerson wrote a eulogy and alcott helped plan the preparations
only two years later neighbor nathaniel hawthorne died as well
alcott served as a pallbearer along with louis agassiz james t
fields oliver wendell holmes sr henry wadsworth longfellow and others
with hawthornes death alcott worried that few of the concord notables remained
he recorded in his journal fair figures one by one are fading from sight
the next year lincoln was assassinated which alcott called appalling news
in alcott met with publisher thomas niles an admirer of hospital sketches
alcott asked niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter instead he suggested she write a book about girls
louisa may was not interested initially but agreed to try
they want a book of pages or more alcott told his daughter
the result was little women published later that year
the book which fictionalized the alcott family during the girls coming of age years recast the father figure as a chaplain away from home at the front in the civil war
alcott spoke as opportunity arose before the lyceums then common in various parts of the united states or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him
these conversations as he called them were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics spiritual aesthetic and practical in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of american transcendentalists led by emerson who was always his supporter and discreet admirer
he often discussed platonic philosophy the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with spirit upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life
alcotts published books all from late in his life include tablets concord days new connecticut and sonnets and canzonets
louisa may attended to her fathers needs in his final years
she purchased a house for her sister anna which had been the last home of henry david thoreau now known as the thoreau alcott house
louisa and her parents moved in with anna as well
after the death of his wife abby may on november alcott never returned to orchard house too heartbroken to live there
he and louisa may collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers letters and journals
my heart bleeds with the memories of those days he wrote and even long years of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence
louisa noted her father had become restless with his anchor gone
they gave up on the memoir project and louisa burned many of her mothers papers
on january alcott and franklin benjamin sanborn wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country
the result was the concord school of philosophy and literature which held its first session in in alcotts study in the orchard house
in the school moved to the hillside chapel a building next to the house where he held conversations and over the course of successive summers as he entered his eighties invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy religion and letters
the school considered one of the first formal adult education centers in america was also attended by foreign scholars
it continued for nine years
in april alcotts friend and benefactor ralph waldo emerson was sick and bedridden
after visiting him alcott wrote concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud
emerson died the next day
alcott himself moved out of concord for his final years settling at louisburg square in boston beginning in
as he was bedridden at the end of his life alcotts daughter louisa may came to visit him at louisburg on march
he said to her i am going up
come with me
she responded i wish i could
he died three days later on march louisa may died only two days after her father
alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to corporal punishment as a means of disciplining his students
instead beginning at the temple school he would appoint a daily student superintendent
when that student observed an infraction he or she reported it to the rest of the class and as a whole they deliberated on punishment
at times alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike saying that any failing was the teachers responsibility
the shame and guilt this method induced he believed was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment when he used physical correction he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application even including the student to be punished
the most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay observations on the principles and methods of infant instruction
alcott believed that early education must draw out unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment
he noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind
alcotts ideas as an educator were controversial
writer harriet martineau for example wrote dubiously that the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth and that his business is to bring it out into expression
even so his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in america and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education
many of alcotts educational principles are still used in classrooms today including teach by encouragement art education music education acting exercises learning through experience risk taking in the classroom tolerance in schools physical education recess and early childhood education
the teachings of william ellery channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the concord transcendentalists
the concord school of philosophy which closed following alcotts death in was reopened almost years later in the s
it has continued functioning with a summer conversational series in its original building at orchard house now run by the louisa may alcott memorial association
while many of alcotts ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal radical edge they are still common themes in society including vegetarian veganism sustainable living and temperance self control
alcott described his sustenance as a pythagorean diet meat eggs butter cheese and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water
alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well being to mental improvement
he further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and in a sense predicted modern environmentalism by condemning pollution and encouraging humankinds role in sustaining ecology
alcotts philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent hazy or abrupt
he formulated no system of philosophy and shows the influence of plato german mysticism and immanuel kant as filtered through the writings of samuel taylor coleridge
margaret fuller referred to alcott as a philosopher of the balmy times of ancient greece a man whom the worldlings of boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of athens held socrates
in his later years alcott related a story from his boyhood during a total solar eclipse he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder
he reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be tilting at the sun and always catching the fall
like emerson alcott was always optimistic idealistic and individualistic in thinking
writer james russell lowell referred to alcott in his poem studies for two heads as an angel with clipped wings
even so emerson noted that alcotts brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing
when he sits down to write emerson wrote all his genius leaves him he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought
his orphic sayings published in the dial became famous for their hilarity as dense pretentious and meaningless
in new york for example the knickerbocker published a parody titled gastric sayings in november
a writer for the boston post referred to alcotts orphic sayings as a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger
modern critics often fault alcott for not being able to financially support his family
alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man once writing to his mother that he was still at my old trade hoping
alcott held his principles above his and his familys well being
shortly before his marriage for example his future father in law colonel joseph may helped him find a job teaching at a school in boston run by the society of free enquirers followers of robert owen for a lucrative to annual salary
he refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs writing i shall have nothing to do with them
from the other perspective the alcotts created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers
arachnophobia is a specific phobia brought about by the irrational fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions and ticks
the word arachnophobia comes from the words arachnid and phobia
people with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence such as webs
if arachnophobes see a spider they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia
some people scream cry have emotional outbursts experience trouble breathing sweat and experience increased heart rates when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs
in some extreme cases even a picture a toy or a realistic drawing of a spider can trigger intense fear
arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly european societies
an evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved
one view especially held in evolutionary psychology is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy
like all traits there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic
being relatively small spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a factor but they can have medically significant venom and or cause skin irritation with their setae
however a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear
by ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments giving them a slight advantage over non arachnophobes in terms of survival
however having a disproportionate fear of spiders in comparison to other potentially dangerous creatures present during homo sapiens environment of evolutionary adaptiveness may have had drawbacks
in the handbook of the emotions psychologist arne hman studied pairing an unconditioned stimulus with evolutionarily relevant fear response neutral stimuli versus evolutionarily irrelevant fear response neutral stimuli on human subjects and found that ophidiophobia and arachnophobia required only one pairing to develop a conditioned response while mycophobia anthophobia phobias of physical representations of polyhedra firearms and electrical outlets required multiple pairings and went extinct without continued conditioning while the conditioned ophidiophobia and arachnophobia were permanent
psychiatrist randolph m
nesse notes that while conditioned fear responses to evolutionarily novel dangerous objects such as electrical outlets is possible the conditioning is slower because such cues have no prewired connection to fear noting further that despite the emphasis of the risks of speeding and drunk driving in drivers education it alone does not provide reliable protection against traffic collisions and that nearly one quarter of all deaths in of people aged to in the united states were in traffic collisions
nesse psychiatrist isaac marks and evolutionary biologist george c
williams have noted that people with systematically deficient responses to various adaptive phobias are more temperamentally careless and more likely to receive unintentional injuries that are potentially fatal and have proposed that such deficient phobia should be classified as hypophobia due to its selfish genetic consequences
a study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders
the researchers suggested that this was because fast response to spiders was more relevant to human evolution
an alternative view is that the dangers such as from spiders are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution
instead inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival rather than being an aid
for some communities such as in papua new guinea and cambodia spiders are included in traditional foods
this suggests arachnophobia may at least in part be a cultural rather than genetic trait
stories about spiders in the media often contain errors and use sensationalistic vocabulary which could contribute to the fear of spiders
the fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias
the first line of treatment is systematic desensitization also known as exposure therapy
before engaging in systematic desensitization it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques which will help keep the patient calm
systematic desensitization can be done in vivo or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders
this technique can be effective in just one session although it generally takes more time
recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy
these techniques have proven to be effective
it has been suggested that exposure to short clips from the spider man movies may help to reduce an individuals arachnophobia
arachnophobia affects to percent of the global population
alabaster is a mineral or rock that is soft often used for carving and is processed for plaster powder
archaeologists and the stone processing industry use the word differently from geologists
the former use it in a wider sense that includes varieties of two different minerals the fine grained massive type of gypsum and the fine grained banded type of calcite
geologists define alabaster only as the gypsum type
chemically gypsum is a hydrous sulfate of calcium while calcite is a carbonate of calcium
the two types of alabaster have similar properties
they are usually lightly colored translucent and soft stones
they have been used throughout history primarily for carving decorative artifacts
the calcite type is also denominated onyx marble egyptian alabaster and oriental alabaster and is geologically described as either a compact banded travertine or a stalagmitic limestone marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown
onyx marble is a traditional but geologically inaccurate name as both onyx and marble have geological definitions that are distinct from even the broadest definition of alabaster
in general ancient alabaster is calcite in the wider middle east including egypt and mesopotamia while it is gypsum in medieval europe
modern alabaster is most likely calcite but may be either
both are easy to work and slightly soluble in water
they have been used for making a variety of indoor artwork and carving as they will not survive long outdoors
the two kinds are readily distinguished by their different hardnesses gypsum alabaster is so soft that a fingernail scratches it while calcite cannot be scratched in this way but yields to a knife
moreover calcite alabaster being a carbonate effervesces when treated with hydrochloric acid while gypsum alabaster remains almost unaffected
the origin of alabaster is in middle english through old french in turn derived from latin and that from greek or
the greek words denoted a vase of alabaster
the name may be derived further from ancient egyptian which refers to vessels of the egyptian goddess bast
she was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels
ancient roman authors pliny the elder and ptolemy wrote that the stone used for ointment jars called alabastra came from a region of egypt known as alabastron or alabastrites
the purest alabaster is a snow white material of fine uniform grain but it often is associated with an oxide of iron which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone
the coarser varieties of gypsum alabaster are converted by calcination into plaster of paris and are sometimes known as plaster stone
the softness of alabaster enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work
if alabaster with a smooth polished surface is washed with dishwashing liquid it will become rough dull and whiter losing most of its translucency and lustre
the finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an ornamental stone especially for ecclesiastical decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls
alabaster is mined and then sold in blocks to alabaster workshops
there they are cut to the needed size and then are processed in different techniques turned on a lathe for round shapes carved into three dimensional sculptures chiselled to produce low relief figures or decoration and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency colour and texture
in order to diminish the translucency of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually nearly to the boiling point an operation requiring great care because if the temperature is not regulated carefully the stone acquires a dead white chalky appearance
the effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum
if properly treated it very closely resembles true marble and is known as marmo di castellina
alabaster is a porous stone and can be dyed into any colour or shade a technique used for centuries
for this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to a specific temperature
the technique can be used to disguise alabaster
in this way a very misleading imitation of coral that is called alabaster coral is produced
typically only one type is sculpted in any particular cultural environment but sometimes both have been worked to make similar pieces in the same place and time
this was the case with small flasks of the alabastron type made in cyprus from the bronze age into the classical period
when cut in thin sheets alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows
it was used for this purpose in byzantine churches and later in medieval ones especially in italy
large sheets of aragonese gypsum alabaster are used extensively in the contemporary cathedral of our lady of the angels which was dedicated in by the los angeles california archdiocese
the cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque
the ancients used the calcite type while the modern los angeles cathedral is using gypsum alabaster
there are also multiple examples of alabaster windows in ordinary village churches and monasteries in northern spain
calcite alabaster harder than the gypsum variety was the kind primarily used in ancient egypt and the wider middle east and is also used in modern times
it is found as either a stalagmitic deposit from the floor and walls of limestone caverns or as a kind of travertine similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water
its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross section from which its name is derived onyx marble or alabaster onyx or sometimes simply as onyx
egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near suez and assiut
this stone variety is the alabaster of the ancient egyptians and bible and is often termed oriental alabaster since the early examples came from the far east
the greek name alabastrites is said to be derived from the town of alabastron in egypt where the stone was quarried
the locality probably owed its name to the mineral the origin of the mineral name is obscure
the oriental alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called alabastra the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name
in egypt craftsmen used alabaster for canopic jars and various other sacred and sepulchral objects
the sarcophagus of seti i found in his tomb near thebes is on display in sir john soanes museum london it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from alabastron
algerian onyx marble has been quarried largely in the province of oran
calcite alabaster was quarried in ancient israel in the cave known today as the twins cave near beit shemesh
herod used this alabaster for baths in his palaces
in mexico there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at la pedrara in the district of tecali near puebla
onyx marble occurs also in the district of tehuacn and at several localities in the us including california arizona utah colorado and virginia
gypsum alabaster is the softer of the two varieties the other being calcite alabaster
it was used primarily in medieval europe and is also used in modern times
mosul marble is a kind of gypsum alabaster found in the north of modern iraq which was used for the assyrian palace reliefs of the th to th centuries bc these are the largest type of alabaster sculptures to have been regularly made
the relief is very low and the carving detailed but large rooms were lined with continuous compositions on slabs around high
the lion hunt of ashurbanipal and military lachish reliefs both th century and in the british museum are some of the best known
gypsum alabaster was widely used for small sculpture for indoor use in the ancient world especially in ancient egypt and mesopotamia
fine detail could be obtained in a material with an attractive finish without iron or steel tools
alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity bast in the culture of the ancient egyptians and thousands of gypsum alabaster artifacts dating to the late th millennium bc also have been found in tell brak in syria
in mesopotamia gypsum alabaster was the material of choice for figures of deities and devotees in temples as in a figure believed to represent the deity abu dating to the first half of the rd millennium bc and currently kept in new york
much of the worlds alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the ebro valley in aragon spain which has the worlds largest known exploitable deposits
according to a brochure published by the aragon government alabaster has elsewhere either been depleted or its extraction is so difficult that it has almost been abandoned or is carried out at a very high cost
there are two separate sites in aragon both are located in tertiary basins
the most important site is the fuentes azaila area in the tertiary ebro basin
the other is the calatayud teruel basin which divides the iberian range in two main sectors
the abundance of aragonese alabaster was crucial for its use in architecture sculpture and decoration
there is no record of likely use by pre roman cultures so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in aragon were the romans who produced vessels from alabaster following the greek and egyptian models
it seems that since the reconstruction of the roman wall in zaragoza in the rd century ad with alabaster the use of this material became common in building for centuries
muslim saraqusta was also called medina albaida the white city due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces which stood out among gardens groves and orchards by the ebro and huerva rivers
the oldest remains in the aljafera palace together with other interesting elements like capitals reliefs and inscriptions were made using alabaster but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the renaissance that aragonese alabaster reached its golden age
in the th century sculptors in aragon chose alabaster for their best works
they were adept at exploiting its lighting qualities and generally speaking the finished art pieces retained their natural color
in europe the centre of the alabaster trade today is florence italy
tuscan alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone interstratified with marls of miocene and pliocene age
the mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries in the district of volterra
several varieties are recognized veined spotted clouded agatiform and others
the finest kind obtained principally from castellina is sent to florence for figure sculpture while the common kinds are carved locally into vases lights and various ornamental objects
these items are objects of extensive trade especially in florence pisa and livorno
in the rd century bc the etruscans used the alabaster of tuscany from the area of modern day volterra to produce funeral urns possibly taught by greek artists
during the middle ages the craft of alabaster was almost completely forgotten
a revival started in the mid th century and until the beginning of the th century alabaster work was strictly artistic and did not expand to form a large industry
in the th and th centuries production of artistic high quality renaissance style artifacts stopped altogether being replaced by less sophisticated cheaper items better suited for large scale production and commerce
the new industry prospered but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working
the th century brought a boom to the industry largely due to the traveling artisans who went and offered their wares to the palaces of europe as well as to america and the east
in the th century new processing technology was also introduced allowing for the production of custom made unique pieces as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials
apart from the newly developed craft artistic work became again possible chiefly by volterran sculptor albino funaioli
after a short slump the industry was revived again by the sale of mass produced mannerist expressionist sculptures and was further enhanced in the s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the art deco style and culminating in the participation at the international exposition of modern industrial and decorative arts from paris
important names from the evolution of alabaster use after world war ii are volterran umberto borgna the first alabaster designer and later on the architect and industrial designer angelo mangiarotti
gypsum alabaster is a common mineral which occurs in england in the keuper marls of the midlands especially at chellaston in derbyshire at fauld in staffordshire and near newark in nottinghamshire
deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively
in the th and th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of relief panels for altarpieces was a valuable local industry in nottingham as well as a major english export
these were usually painted or partly painted
it was also used for the effigies often life size on tomb monuments as the typical recumbent position suited the materials lack of strength and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble
after the english reformation the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued
besides examples of these carvings still in britain trade in mineral alabaster has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the muse de cluny spain and scandinavia
alabaster also is found although in smaller quantity at watchet in somerset near penarth in glamorganshire and elsewhere
in cumbria it occurs largely in the new red rocks but at a lower geological horizon
the alabaster of nottinghamshire and derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or floors in spheroidal masses known as balls or bowls and in smaller lenticular masses termed cakes
at chellaston where the local alabaster is known as patrick it has been worked into ornaments under the name of derbyshire spar a term more properly applied to fluorspar
black alabaster is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum based mineral
this black form is found in only three veins in the world one each in united states italy and china
alabaster caverns state park near freedom oklahoma is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster
there are several types of alabaster found at the site including pink white and the rare black alabaster
ahab was the seventh king of israel the son and successor of king omri and the husband of jezebel of sidon according to the hebrew bible
the hebrew bible presents ahab as a wicked king particularly for condoning jezebels influence on religious policies and his principal role behind naboths arbitrary execution
the existence of ahab is historically supported outside the bible
shalmaneser iii of assyria documented in bc that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the battle of qarqar one of these was ahab
he is also mentioned on the inscriptions of the mesha stele
ahab became king of israel in the thirty eighth year of king asa of judah and reigned for twenty two years according to kings
william f
albright dated his reign to bc while edwin r
thiele offered the dates bc
most recently michael coogan has dated ahabs reign to bc
king omri ahabs father and founder of the short lived omri dynasty seems to have been a successful military leader he is reported in the text of the moabite mesha stele to have oppressed moab for many days
during ahabs reign moab which had been conquered by his father remained tributary
ahab was allied by marriage with jehoshaphat who was king of judah
only with aram damascus is he believed to have had strained relations though the two kingdoms also shared an alliance for some years
ahab married jezebel the daughter of the king of tyre
tells the story of ahab and jezebel and indicates that jezebel was a dominant influence on ahab persuading him to abandon yahweh and establish the religion of baal in israel
ahab lived in samaria the royal capital established by omri and built a temple and altar to baal there
these actions were said to have led to severe consequences for israel including a drought that lasted for several years and jezebels fanatical religious persecution of the prophets of yahweh which ahab condoned
his reputation was so negative that in kings the author attributed to his reign the deaths of abiram and segub the sons of hiel of bethel caused by their fathers invocation of joshuas curse several centuries before
according to war later erupted between ahab and king hadadezer of aram damascus and that ahab was able to defeat and capture him however soon after that a peace treaty was made between the two and alliance between israel and aram damascus was formed
the battle of qarqar is mentioned in extra biblical records and was perhaps at apamea where shalmaneser iii of assyria fought a great confederation of princes from cilicia northern syria israel ammon and the tribes of the syrian desert including arabs ahab the israelite and hadadezer
ahabs contribution was estimated at chariots and men
in reality however the number of chariots in ahabs forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds
if however the numbers are referring to allies they could possibly include forces from tyre judah edom and moab
the assyrian king claimed a victory but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in bc and bc against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success
jezreel has been identified as ahabs fortified chariot and cavalry base
after some years ahab with jehoshaphat of judah went to recover ramoth gilead from the arameans
during this battle ahab disguised himself but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow
the hebrew bible says that dogs licked his blood according to the prophecy of elijah
but the septuagint adds that pigs also licked his blood symbolically making him unclean to the israelites who abstained from pork
ahab was succeeded by his sons ahaziah and jehoram
jezebels death however was more dramatic than ahabs
as recorded in jehu had his servants throw jezebel out of a window causing her death
the dogs ate jezebels body leaving nothing but her skull her feet and the palms of her hands as prophesied by elijah
kings through contains the narrative of ahabs reign
his reign was slightly more emphasized upon than the previous kings due to his blatant trivialization of the sins of jeroboam which the previous kings of israel were plagued by and his subsequent marriage with a pagan princess the nationwide institution of baal worship the persecution of yahwehs prophets and naboths shocking murder
these offenses and atrocities stirred up populist resentment from figures such as elijah and micaiah
indeed he is referred to by the author of kings as being more evil than all the kings before him
nonetheless there were achievements that the author took note of including his ability to fortify numerous israelite cities and build an ivory palace
adherents of the yahwist religion found their principal champion in elijah
his denunciation of the royal dynasty of israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of yahweh and yahweh alone illustrated by the contest between yahweh and baal on mount carmel form the keynote to a period that culminated in the accession of jehu an event in which elijahs chosen disciple elisha was the leading figure and the omride dynasty was brutally defeated
ahab was one of the three or four wicked kings of israel singled out by tradition as being excluded from the future world of bliss
midrash konen places him in the fifth department of gehenna as having the heathen under his charge
though held up as a warning to sinners ahab is also described as displaying noble traits of character
talmudic literature represents him as an enthusiastic idolater who left no hilltop in the land of israel without an idol before which he bowed and to which he or his wife jezebel brought his weight in gold as a daily offering
so defiant in his apostasy was he that he had inscribed on all the doors of the city of samaria the words ahab hath abjured the living god of israel
nevertheless he paid great respect to the representatives of learning to the torah given in twenty two letters for which reason he was permitted to reign for twenty two successive years
he generously supported the students of the law out of his royal treasury in consequence of which half his sins were forgiven him
a type of worldliness the crsus of his time he was according to ancient tradition ruler over the whole world
two hundred and thirty subject kings had initiated a rebellion but he brought their sons as hostages to samaria and jerusalem
all the latter turned from idolaters into worshipers of the god of israel
each of his seventy sons had an ivory palace built for him
since however it was ahabs idolatrous wife who was the chief instigator of his crimes some of the ancient teachers gave him the same position in the world to come as a sinner who had repented
like manasseh he was made a type of repentance
accordingly he is described as undergoing fasts and penances for a long time praying thrice a day to god for forgiveness until his prayer was heard
hence the name of ahab in the list of wicked kings was changed to ahaz
pseudo epiphanius makes micah an ephraimite
confounding him with micaiah son of imlah he states that micah for his inauspicious prophecy was killed by order of ahab through being thrown from a precipice and was buried at morathi near the cemetery of enakim
according to gelilot ere yisrael micah was buried in chesil a town in southern judah
naboths soul was the lying spirit that was permitted to deceive ahab to his death
ahab is portrayed by eduard franz in the film sins of jezebel
he is also the namesake of captain ahab in moby dick by herman melville

dasyproctidae is a family of large south american rodents comprising the agoutis and acouchis
their fur is a reddish or dark colour above with a paler underside
they are herbivorous often feeding on ripe fruit that falls from trees
they live in burrows and like squirrels will bury some of their food for later use
dasyproctids exist in central and south america which are the tropical parts of the new world
the fossil record of this family can be traced back to the late oligocene
as with all rodents members of this family have incisors pre molars and molars but no canines
the cheek teeth are hypsodont and flat crowned
fossil taxa follow mckenna and bell with modifications following kramarz
the pacas are placed by some authorities in dasyproctidae but molecular studies have demonstrated they do not form a monophyletic group
algol designated beta persei known colloquially as the demon star is a bright multiple star in the constellation of perseus and one of the first non nova variable stars to be discovered
algol is a three star system consisting of beta persei aa aa and ab in which the hot luminous primary persei aa and the larger but cooler and fainter persei aa regularly pass in front of each other causing eclipses
thus algols magnitude is usually near constant at but regularly dips to every days during the roughly hour long partial eclipses
the secondary eclipse when the brighter primary star occults the fainter secondary is very shallow and can only be detected photoelectrically
algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable known as algol variables
an ancient egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days composed some years ago is said to be the oldest historical documentation of the discovery of algol
the association of algol with a demon like creature suggests that its variability was known long before the th century but there is still no indisputable evidence for this
the arabic astronomer al sufi said nothing about any variability of the star in his book of fixed stars published c
the variability of algol was noted in by italian astronomer geminiano montanari but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later when the british amateur astronomer john goodricke also proposed a mechanism for the stars variability
in may he presented his findings to the royal society suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star
for his report he was awarded the copley medal
in the harvard astronomer edward charles pickering presented evidence that algol was actually an eclipsing binary
this was confirmed a few years later in when the potsdam astronomer hermann carl vogel found periodic doppler shifts in the spectrum of algol inferring variations in the radial velocity of this binary system
thus algol became one of the first known spectroscopic binaries
joel stebbins at the university of illinois observatory used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first ever photoelectric study of a variable star
the light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars
some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct
algol is a multiple star system with three confirmed and two suspected stellar components
from the point of view of the earth algol aa and algol aa form an eclipsing binary because their orbital plane contains the line of sight to the earth
the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only astronomical units from each other whereas the third star in the system is at an average distance of au from the pair and the mutual orbital period of the trio is earth days
the total mass of the system is about solar masses and the mass ratios of aa aa and ab are about to to
the three components of the bright triple star used to be and still sometimes are referred to as per a b and c
the washington double star catalog lists them as aa aa and ab with two very faint stars b and c about one arcmin distant
a further five faint stars are also listed as companions
the close pair consists of a b main sequence star and a much less massive k subgiant which is highly distorted by the more massive star
these two orbit every days and undergo the eclipses that cause algol to vary in brightness
the third star orbits these two every days and is an a or f type main sequence star
it has been classified as an am star but this is now considered doubtful
studies of algol led to the algol paradox in the theory of stellar evolution although components of a binary star form at the same time and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars the more massive component algol aa is still in the main sequence but the less massive algol aa is a subgiant star at a later evolutionary stage
the paradox can be solved by mass transfer when the more massive star became a subgiant it filled its roche lobe and most of the mass was transferred to the other star which is still in the main sequence
in some binaries similar to algol a gas flow can be seen
the gas flow between the primary and secondary stars in algol has been imaged using doppler tomography
this system also exhibits x ray and radio wave flares
the x ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the a and b components interacting with the mass transfer
the radio wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of sunspots but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the sun these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent
the secondary component was identified as the radio emitting source in algol using very long baseline interferometry by lestrade and co authors
magnetic activity cycles in the chromospherically active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of via the applegate mechanism
mass transfer between the components is small in the algol system but could be a significant source of period change in other algol type binaries
algol is about light years from the sun but about million years ago it passed within light years of the solar system and its apparent magnitude was about which is considerably brighter than the star sirius is today
because the total mass of the algol system is about solar masses at the closest approach this might have given enough gravity to perturb the oort cloud of the solar system somewhat and hence increase the number of comets entering the inner solar system
however the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small
beta persei is the stars bayer designation
the name algol derives from arabic ras al ghl head of the ogre
the english name demon star was taken from the arabic name
in the international astronomical union organized a working group on star names to catalog and standardize proper names for stars
the wgsns first bulletin of july included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the wgsn which included algol for this star
it is so entered on the iau catalog of star names
in hebrew folklore algol was called rsh ha sn or satans head as stated by edmund chilmead who called it divels head or rosch hassatan
a latin name for algol from the th century was caput larvae or the spectres head
hipparchus and pliny made this a separate though connected constellation
in chinese meaning mausoleum refers to an asterism consisting of persei persei persei persei persei persei persei and persei
consequently the chinese name for persei itself is
according to rh allen the star bore the grim name of tseih she meaning piled up corpses but this appears to be a misidentification and di sh is correctly persei which is inside the mausoleum
historically the star has received a strong association with bloody violence across a wide variety of cultures
in the tetrabiblos the nd century astrological text of the alexandrian astronomer ptolemy algol is referred to as the gorgon of perseus and associated with death by decapitation a theme which mirrors the myth of the hero perseuss victory over the snake haired gorgon medusa
in the astrology of fixed stars algol is considered one of the unluckiest stars in the sky and was listed as one of the behenian stars
amazing grace is a christian hymn published in with words written in by english anglican clergyman and poet john newton
it is an immensely popular hymn particularly in the united states where it is used for both religious and secular purposes
newton wrote the words from personal experience he grew up without any particular religious conviction but his lifes path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by others reactions to what they took as his recalcitrant insubordination
he was pressed into service with the royal navy and after leaving the service he became involved in the atlantic slave trade
in a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of county donegal ireland so severely that he called out to god for mercy
while this moment marked his spiritual conversion he continued slave trading until or when he ended his seafaring altogether
newton began studying christian theology and later became an abolitionist
ordained in the church of england in newton became the curate of olney buckinghamshire where he began to write hymns with poet william cowper
amazing grace was written to illustrate a sermon on new years day of
it is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses it may have been chanted by the congregation
it debuted in print in in newtons and cowpers olney hymns but settled into relative obscurity in england
in the united states amazing grace became a popular song used by baptist and methodist preachers as part of their evangelizing especially in the american south during the second great awakening of the early th century
it has been associated with more than melodies
in american composer william walker set it to the tune known as new britain in a shape note format this is the version most frequently sung today
with the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of god amazing grace is one of the most recognisable songs in the english speaking world
american historian gilbert chase writes that it is without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns and jonathan aitken a newton biographer estimates that the song is performed about million times annually
it has had particular influence in folk music and has become an emblematic black spiritual
its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music
amazing grace became newly popular during the s revival of american folk music and it has been recorded thousands of times during and since the th century
according to the dictionary of american hymnology amazing grace is john newtons spiritual autobiography in verse
in newton was born in wapping a district in london near the thames
his father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a catholic but had protestant sympathies and his mother was a devout independent unaffiliated with the anglican church
she had intended newton to become a clergyman but she died of tuberculosis when he was six years old
for the next few years while his father was at sea newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother
he was also sent to boarding school where he was mistreated
at the age of eleven he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience
as a youth newton began a pattern of coming very close to death examining his relationship with god then relapsing into bad habits
as a sailor he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed with him characteristicks of men manners opinions times a book by the third earl of shaftesbury
in a series of letters newton later wrote like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm i renounced the hopes and comforts of the gospel at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me
his disobedience caused him to be pressed into the royal navy and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave
he deserted the navy to visit mary polly catlett a family friend with whom he had fallen in love
after enduring humiliation for deserting he was traded as crew to a slave ship
he began a career in slave trading
newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him which became so popular that the crew began to join in
his disagreements with several colleagues resulted in his being starved almost to death imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried
he was himself enslaved by the sherbro and forced to work on a plantation in sierra leone near the sherbro river
after several months he came to think of sierra leone as his home but his father intervened after newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances and crew from another ship happened to find him
newton claimed the only reason he left sierra leone was because of polly
while aboard the ship greyhound newton gained notoriety as being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met
in a culture where sailors habitually swore newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery
in march while the greyhound was in the north atlantic a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where newton had been moments before
after hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized newton and another mate tied themselves to the ships pump to keep from being washed overboard working for several hours
after proposing the measure to the captain newton had turned and said if this will not do then lord have mercy upon us newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours
during his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge
about two weeks later the battered ship and starving crew landed in lough swilly ireland
for several weeks before the storm newton had been reading the christians pattern a summary of the th century the imitation of christ by thomas kempis
the memory of his own lord have mercy upon us uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him he began to ask if he was worthy of gods mercy or in any way redeemable
not only had he neglected his faith but directly opposed it mocking others who showed theirs deriding and denouncing god as a myth
he came to believe that god had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him
newtons conversion was not immediate but he contacted pollys family and announced his intention to marry her
her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous
they knew he was profane too but allowed him to write to polly and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake
he sought a place on a slave ship bound for africa and newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity
after a severe illness his resolve was renewed yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries
newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed the coasts of africa now as a captain and procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports transporting them to north america
in between voyages he married polly in and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip
after three shipping voyages in the slave trade newton was promised a position as ships captain with cargo unrelated to slavery
but at the age of thirty he collapsed and never sailed again
working as a customs agent in liverpool starting in newton began to teach himself latin greek and theology
he and polly immersed themselves in the church community and newtons passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the church of england
he was turned down by john gilbert archbishop of york in ostensibly for having no university degree although the more likely reasons were his leanings toward evangelism and tendency to socialise with methodists
newton continued his devotions and after being encouraged by a friend he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion
william legge nd earl of dartmouth impressed with his story sponsored newton for ordination by john green bishop of lincoln and offered him the curacy of olney buckinghamshire in
olney was a village of about residents whose main industry was making lace by hand
the people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor
newtons preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit many clergy preached from a distance not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin
he was involved in his parishioners lives and was much loved although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished
but his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful and he often said his mission was to break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart
he struck a friendship with william cowper a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity attempting suicide several times
cowper enjoyed olney and newtons company he was also new to olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to newtons
together their effect on the local congregation was impressive
in they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners
they also began writing lessons for children
partly from cowpers literary influence and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses newton began to try his hand at hymns which had become popular through the language made plain for common people to understand
several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the th century including isaac watts whose hymns newton had grown up hearing and charles wesley with whom newton was familiar
wesleys brother john the eventual founder of the methodist church had encouraged newton to go into the clergy
watts was a pioneer in english hymn writing basing his work after the psalms
the most prevalent hymns by watts and others were written in the common meter in the first line is eight syllables and the second is six
newton and cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting
the lyrics to amazing grace were written in late and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on january
a collection of the poems newton and cowper had written for use in services at olney was bound and published anonymously in under the title olney hymns
newton contributed of the texts in olney hymns chronicles faiths review and expectation was the title of the poem with the first line amazing grace
the general impact of olney hymns was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in britain for many years
scholars appreciated cowpers poetry somewhat more than newtons plaintive and plain language expressing his forceful personality
the most prevalent themes in the verses written by newton in olney hymns are faith in salvation wonder at gods grace his love for jesus and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith
as a reflection of newtons connection to his parishioners he wrote many of the hymns in first person admitting his own experience with sin
bruce hindmarsh in sing them over again to me hymns and hymnbooks in america considers amazing grace an excellent example of newtons testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective
several of newtons hymns were recognised as great work while others seem to have been included to fill in when cowper was unable to write
jonathan aitken calls newton specifically referring to amazing grace an unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation noting that only twenty one of the nearly words used in all six verses have more than one syllable
william phipps in the anglican theological review and author james basker have interpreted the first stanza of amazing grace as evidence of newtons realisation that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness perhaps representing a wider common understanding of newtons motivations
newton joined forces with a young man named william wilberforce the british member of parliament who led the parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the british empire culminating in the slave trade act
but newton did not become an ardent and outspoken abolitionist until after he left olney in the s he is not known to have connected writing the hymn known as amazing grace to anti slavery sentiments
the lyrics in olney hymns were arranged by their association to the biblical verses that would be used by newton and cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective
for newton the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on ones spiritual progress
at the same time he completed a diary which has since been lost that he had begun years before two years after he quit sailing
the last entry of was a recounting of how much he had changed since then
the title ascribed to the hymn chronicles refers to davids reaction to the prophet nathan telling him that god intends to maintain his family line forever
some christians interpret this as a prediction that jesus christ as a descendant of david was promised by god as the salvation for all people
newtons sermon on that january day in focused on the necessity to express ones gratitude for gods guidance that god is involved in the daily lives of christians though they may not be aware of it and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await
newton saw himself a sinner like david who had been chosen perhaps undeservedly and was humbled by it
according to newton unconverted sinners were blinded by the god of this world until mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired
our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace
the new testament served as the basis for many of the lyrics of amazing grace
the first verse for example can be traced to the story of the prodigal son
in the gospel of luke the father says for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found
the story of jesus healing a blind man who tells the pharisees that he can now see is told in the gospel of john
newton used the words i was blind but now i see and declared oh to grace how great a debtor in his letters and diary entries as early as
the effect of the lyrical arrangement according to bruce hindmarsh allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation amazing grace to be followed by a qualifying reply in how sweet the sound
in an annotated anthology of hymns newtons use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called crude but effective in an overall composition that suggest a forceful if simple statement of faith
grace is recalled three times in the following verse culminating in newtons most personal story of his conversion underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners
the sermon preached by newton was his last of those that william cowper heard in olney since cowpers mental instability returned shortly thereafter
one author suggests newton may have had his friend in mind employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for cowpers benefit
more than of newton and cowpers hymns were republished in other british hymnals and magazines but amazing grace was not appearing only once in a hymnal sponsored by the countess of huntingdon
scholar john julian commented in his a dictionary of hymnology that outside of the united states the song was unknown and it was far from being a good example of newtons finest work
between and four variations of newtons hymn were published in the us in baptist dutch reformed and congregationalist hymnodies by presbyterians and methodists also included newtons verses in their hymnals
although it had its roots in england amazing grace became an integral part of the christian tapestry in the united states
the greatest influences in the th century that propelled amazing grace to spread across the us and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the second great awakening and the development of shape note singing communities
a tremendous religious movement swept the us in the early th century marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start on the frontier in kentucky and tennessee
unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding
religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony and made as plain and simple as possible sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin
witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings where a congregation member or stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace
amazing grace was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons although the contemporary style used a refrain borrowed from other hymns that employed simplicity and repetition such as simultaneously an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the south and western states
a format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in
it used four sounds to symbolise the basic scale fa sol la fa sol la mi fa
each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing
the method was simple to learn and teach so schools were established throughout the south and west
communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space one member directing the group as a whole
other groups would sing outside on benches set up in a square
preachers used shape note hymns to teach people on the frontier and to raise the emotion of camp meetings
most of the music was christian but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual
communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a calvinistic sense of simplicity so the songs were sung a cappella
when originally used in olney it is unknown what music if any accompanied the verses written by john newton
contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry
the first known instance of newtons lines joined to music was in a companion to the countess of huntingdons hymns where it is set to the tune hephzibah by english composer john jenkins husband
common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes more than twenty musical settings of amazing grace circulated with varying popularity until when american composer william walker assigned newtons words to a traditional song named new britain
this was an amalgamation of two melodies first published in the columbian harmony by charles h
spilman and benjamin shaw
spilman and shaw both students at kentuckys centre college compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals to satisfy the wants of the church in her triumphal march
most of the tunes had been previously published but gallaher and st
mary had not
as neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of british origin
a manuscript from by lucius chapin a famous hymn writer of that time contains a tune very close to st
mary but that does not mean that he wrote it
amazing grace with the words written by newton and joined with new britain the melody most currently associated with it appeared for the first time in walkers shape note tunebook southern harmony in
it was according to author steve turner a marriage made in heaven
the music behind amazing had a sense of awe to it
the music behind grace sounded graceful
there was a rise at the point of confession as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness
walkers collection was enormously popular selling about copies all over the us when the total population was just over million
another shape note tunebook named the sacred harp by georgia residents benjamin franklin white and elisha j
king became widely influential and continues to be used
another verse was first recorded in harriet beecher stowes immensely influential anti slavery novel uncle toms cabin
three verses were emblematically sung by tom in his hour of deepest crisis
he sings the sixth and fifth verses in that order and stowe included another verse not written by newton that had been passed down orally in african american communities for at least years
it was one of between and verses of a song titled jerusalem my happy home which was first published in a book called a collection of sacred ballads amazing grace came to be an emblem of a christian movement and a symbol of the us itself as the country was involved in a great political experiment attempting to employ democracy as a means of government
shape note singing communities with all the members sitting around an open center each song employing a different song leader illustrated this in practice
simultaneously the us began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness
the dangers toils and snares of newtons lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for americans
this became poignantly true during the most serious test of american cohesion in the us civil war
amazing grace set to new britain was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers
with death so real and imminent religious services in the military became commonplace
the hymn was translated into other languages as well while on the trail of tears the cherokee sang christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy and a version of the song by samuel worcester that had been translated into the cherokee language became very popular
although amazing grace set to new britain was popular other versions existed regionally
primitive baptists in the appalachian region often used new britain with other hymns and sometimes sing the words of amazing grace to other folk songs including titles such as in the pines pisgah primrose and evan as all are able to be sung in common meter of which the majority of their repertoire consists
in the late th century newtons verses were sung to a tune named arlington as frequently as to new britain for a time
two musical arrangers named dwight moody and ira sankey heralded another religious revival in the cities of the us and europe giving the song international exposure
moodys preaching and sankeys musical gifts were significant their arrangements were the forerunners of gospel music and churches all over the us were eager to acquire them
moody and sankey began publishing their compositions in and amazing grace appeared three times with three different melodies but they were the first to give it its title hymns were typically published using the incipits or the name of the tune such as new britain
publisher edwin othello excell gave the version of amazing grace set to new britain immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches
excell altered some of walkers music making it more contemporary and european giving new britain some distance from its rural folk music origins
excells version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs
several editions featuring newtons first three stanzas and the verse previously included by harriet beecher stowe in uncle toms cabin were published by excell between and
his version of amazing grace became the standard form of the song in american churches
with the advent of recorded music and radio amazing grace began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences
the ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed amazing grace to take on thousands of different forms in the th century
where edwin othello excell sought to make the singing of amazing grace uniform throughout thousands of churches records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience
allmusic lists over recordings including re releases and compilations as of
its first recording is an a cappella version from by the sacred harp choir
it was included from to in okeh records catalogue which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz
demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by h
tomlin and j
a poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the s and s who used the song to remember their grandparents traditions and family roots
it was recorded with musical accompaniment for the first time in by fiddlin john carson although to another folk hymn named at the cross not to new britain
amazing grace is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as lining out and call and response that have been practised in both black and white folk music
mahalia jacksons version received significant radio airplay and as her popularity grew throughout the s and s she often sang it at public events such as concerts at carnegie hall
author james basker states that the song has been employed by african americans as the paradigmatic negro spiritual because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries
anthony heilbut author of the gospel sound states that the dangers toils and snares of newtons words are a universal testimony of the african american experience
during the civil rights movement and opposition to the vietnam war the song took on a political tone
mahalia jackson employed amazing grace for civil rights marchers writing that she used it to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend
i was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls
in the open air of mississippi
but i wasnt taking any chances
folk singer judy collins who knew the song before she could remember learning it witnessed fannie lou hamer leading marchers in mississippi in singing amazing grace
collins also considered it a of sorts and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers witnesses and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators
according to fellow folk singer joan baez it was one of the most requested songs from her audiences but she never realised its origin as a hymn by the time she was singing it in the s she said it had developed a life of its own
it even made an appearance at the woodstock music festival in during arlo guthries performance
collins decided to record it in the late s amid an atmosphere of counterculture introspection she was part of an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing amazing grace as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words
her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her album whales nightingales
collins who had a history of alcohol abuse claimed that the song was able to pull her through to recovery
it was recorded in st
pauls the chapel at columbia university chosen for the acoustics
she chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to edwin othello excells accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers
collins connected it to the vietnam war to which she objected i didnt know what else to do about the war in vietnam
i had marched i had voted i had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates i believed in
the war was still raging
there was nothing left to do i thought
but sing amazing grace
gradually and unexpectedly the song began to be played on the radio and then be requested
it rose to number on the billboard hot remaining on the charts for weeks as if she wrote her fans had been waiting to embrace it
in the uk it charted times between and peaking at number and spending a total of weeks on popular music charts
her rendition also reached number in new zealand and number in ireland in
in the royal scots dragoon guards the senior scottish regiment of the british army recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe band
the tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes but it was based on collinss it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus
it became an international hit spending five weeks at number one in the uk singles chart topping the rpm national singles chart in canada for three weeks and also peaking at number on the billboard hot in the us
it is also a controversial instrumental as it combined pipes with a military band
the pipe major of the royal scots dragoon guards was summoned to edinburgh castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes
aretha franklin and rod stewart also recorded amazing grace around the same time and both of their renditions were popular
all four versions were marketed to distinct types of audiences thereby assuring its place as a pop song
johnny cash recorded it on his album sings precious memories dedicating it to his older brother jack who had been killed in a mill accident when they were boys in dyess arkansas
cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following jacks death
cash often included the song when he toured prisons saying for the three minutes that song is going on everybody is free
it just frees the spirit and frees the person
the us library of congress has a collection of versions of and songs inspired by amazing grace some of which were first time recordings by folklorists alan and john lomax a father and son team who in travelled thousands of miles across the southern states of the us to capture the different regional styles of the song
more contemporary renditions include samples from such popular artists as sam cooke and the soul stirrers the byrds elvis presley skeeter davis mighty clouds of joy amazing rhythm aces willie nelson and the lemonheads
amazing grace is an icon in american culture that has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns
it is referenced in the film amazing grace which highlights newtons influence on the leading british abolitionist william wilberforce in the film biography of newton newtons grace and the film freedom which tells the story of newtons composition of the hymn
since when an organ instrumental of new britain became a best seller amazing grace has been associated with funerals and memorial services
the hymn has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy becoming a sort of spiritual national anthem according to authors mary rourke and emily gwathmey
for example president barack obama recited and later sang the hymn at the memorial service for clementa pinckney who was one of the nine victims of the charleston church shooting in
in recent years the words of the hymn have been changed in some religious publications to downplay a sense of imposed self loathing by its singers
the second line that saved a wretch like me has been rewritten as that saved and strengthened me save a soul like me or that saved and set me free
kathleen norris in her book amazing grace a vocabulary of faith characterises this transformation of the original words as wretched english making the line that replaces the original laughably bland
part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means
newtons calvinistic view of redemption and divine grace formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was unable to change his life or be redeemed without gods help
yet his lyrical subtlety in steve turners opinion leaves the hymns meaning open to a variety of christian and non christian interpretations
wretch also represents a period in newtons life when he saw himself outcast and miserable as he was when he was enslaved in sierra leone his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life
due to its immense popularity and iconic nature the meaning behind the words of amazing grace has become as individual as the singer or listener
bruce hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of amazing grace is due to the absence of any mention of god in the lyrics until the fourth verse and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of god
grace however had a clearer meaning to john newton as he used the word to represent god or the power of god
the transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist bill moyers in a documentary released in
moyers was inspired to focus on the songs power after watching a performance at lincoln center where the audience consisted of christians and non christians and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance unifying them
james basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose amazing grace to represent a collection of anti slavery poetry there is a transformative power that is applicable
the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace of suffering into beauty of alienation into empathy and connection of the unspeakable into imaginative literature
moyers interviewed collins cash opera singer jessye norman appalachian folk musician jean ritchie and her family white sacred harp singers in georgia black sacred harp singers in alabama and a prison choir at the texas state penitentiary at huntsville
collins cash and norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics
norman who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor rock concert for nelson mandelas th birthday stated i dont know whether its the text i dont know whether were talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether its that tune that everybody knows
a prisoner interviewed by moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realised he may never get his life in order compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison
gospel singer marion williams summed up its effect thats a song that gets to everybody
the dictionary of american hymnology claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals and recommends its use for occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by gods grace alone as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon as a confession of faith or after the sermon

in before the discontinuation of aim billions of messages were sent daily on it and aols other chat services
aol desktop is an internet suite produced by aol from that integrates a web browser a media player and an instant messenger client
version x was based on aol openride it is an upgrade from such
the macos version is based on webkit
aol desktop version x was different from previous aol browsers and aol desktop versions
its features are focused on web browsing as well as email
for instance one does not have to sign into aol in order to use it as a regular browser
in addition non aol email accounts can be accessed through it
primary buttons include mail im and several shortcuts to various web pages
the first two require users to sign in but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication
aol desktop version x was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the aol desktop x versions
version was released replacing the internet explorer components of the internet browser with cef to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of chrome
version of aol desktop was a total rewrite but maintained a similar user interface to the previous x series of releases
in a new paid version called aol desktop gold was released available for per month after trial
it replaced the previous free version
after the shutdown of aim in aols original chat rooms continued to be accessible through aol desktop gold and some rooms remained active during peak hours
that chat system was shut down on december
in addition to aol desktop the company also offered a browser toolbar mozilla plug in aol toolbar for several web browsers that provided quick access to aol services
the toolbar was available from until
in its earlier incarnation as a walled garden community and service provider aol received criticism for its community policies terms of service and customer service
prior to aol was known for its direct mailing of cd roms and inch floppy disks containing its software
the disks were distributed in large numbers at one point half of the cds manufactured worldwide had aol logos on them
the marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost and aol cds were recognized as pc worlds most annoying tech product
aol used a system of volunteers to moderate its chat rooms forums and user communities
the program dated back to aols early days when it charged by the hour for access and one of its highest billing services was chat
aol provided free access to community leaders in exchange for moderating the chat rooms and this effectively made chat very cheap to operate and more lucrative than aols other services of the era
there were community leaders in
all community leaders received hours of training and underwent a probationary period
while most community leaders moderated chat rooms some ran aol communities and controlled their layout and design with as much as of aols content being created or overseen by community managers until
by isps were beginning to charge flat rates for unlimited access which they could do at a profit because they only provided internet access
even though aol would lose money with such a pricing scheme it was forced by market conditions to offer unlimited access in october
in order to return to profitability aol rapidly shifted its focus from content creation to advertising resulting in less of a need to carefully moderate every forum and chat room to keep users willing to pay by the minute to remain connected
after unlimited access aol considered scrapping the program entirely but continued it with a reduced number of community leaders with scaled back roles in creating content
although community leaders continued to receive free access after they were motivated more by the prestige of the position and the access to moderator tools and restricted areas within aol
by there were over volunteers in the program
in may two former volunteers filed a class action lawsuit alleging aol violated the fair labor standards act by treating volunteers like employees
volunteers had to apply for the position commit to working for at least three to four hours a week fill out timecards and sign a non disclosure agreement
on july aol ended its youth corps which consisted of underage community leaders
at this time the united states department of labor began an investigation into the program but it came to no conclusions about aols practices
aol ended its community leader program on june
the class action lawsuit dragged on for years even after aol ended the program and aol declined as a major internet company
in aol finally agreed to settle the lawsuit for million
the community leader program was found to be an example of co production in a article in international journal of cultural studies
aol has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled either by the company or the user
in addition aol changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit
previously aol would add seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute
aol claimed this was to account for sign on sign off time but because this practice was not made known to its customers the plaintiffs won
aol disclosed its connection time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours
in addition the aol software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged
aol was sued by the ohio attorney general in october for improper billing practices
the case was settled on june
aol agreed to resolve any consumer complaints filed with the ohio ags office
in december aol agreed to provide restitution to florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the florida attorney general
many customers complained that aol personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing
in response to approximately consumer complaints the new york attorney generals office began an inquiry of aols customer service policies
the investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to retain or save subscribers who had called to cancel their internet service
in many instances such retention was done against subscribers wishes or without their consent
under the scheme customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or save half of the people who called to cancel service
for several years aol had instituted minimum retention or save percentages which consumer representatives were expected to meet
these bonuses and the minimum save rates accompanying them had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers
on august america online agreed to pay million to the state of new york and reformed its customer service procedures
under the agreement aol would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus
however the agreement only covered people in the state of new york
on june vincent ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post stating he had switched to broadband years earlier
in the recorded phone call the aol representative refused to cancel the account unless the year old ferrari explained why aol hours were still being recorded on it
ferrari insisted that aol software was not even installed on the computer
when ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless the aol representative asked to speak with ferraris father for whom the account had been set up
the conversation was aired on cnbc
when cnbc reporters tried to have an account on aol cancelled they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than minutes to cancel the account
on july aols entire retention manual was released on the internet
on august time warner announced that the company would be dissolving aols retention centers due to its profits hinging on billion in cost cuts
the company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year
prior to aol often sent unsolicited mass direct mail of floppy disks and cd roms containing their software
they were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign
according to pc world in the s you couldnt open a magazine or your mailbox without an aol disk falling out of it
the mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups
one such was no more aol cds a web based effort by two it workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to aol
the website was started in august and an estimated cds were collected by august when the project was shut down
in aol was served with an billion lawsuit alleging that its aol software caused significant difficulties for users attempting to use third party internet service providers
the lawsuit sought damages of up to for each user that had downloaded the software cited at the time of the lawsuit
aol later agreed to a settlement of million without admission of wrongdoing
the aol software then was given a feature called aol dialer or aol connect on
this feature allowed users to connect to the isp without running the full interface
this allowed users to use only the applications they wish to use especially if they do not favor the aol browser
aol was once identified by stopbadware as being under investigation for installing additional software without disclosure and modifying browser preferences toolbars and icons
however as of the release of aol vr on january it was no longer considered badware due to changes aol made in the software
when aol gave clients access to usenet in they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view altaol sucks
aol did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view but changed the description to flames and complaints about america online
with aol clients swarming usenet newsgroups the old existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both aol and its clients referring to the new state of affairs as eternal september
aol discontinued access to usenet on june
no official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning usenet access except providing users the suggestion to access usenet services from a third party google groups
aol then provided community based message boards in lieu of usenet
aol has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service known as the terms of service
it is separated into three different sections member agreement community guidelines and privacy policy
all three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the aol service
during the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on terms of service violations
there have been many complaints over rules that govern an aol users conduct
some users disagree with the tos citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the tos may change without users being made aware
a considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user generated content during the earlier years of growth for aol
in early aol stated its intention to implement a certified email system called goodmail which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre existing business relationships with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by spam filters
this decision drew fire from moveon which characterized the program as an email tax and the electronic frontier foundation which characterized it as a shakedown of non profits
a website called dearaolcom was launched with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to aols use of goodmail
esther dyson defended the move in an editorial in the new york times saying i hope goodmail succeeds and that it has lots of competition
i also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients
instead of the fees going to goodmail and aol they will also be shared with the individual recipients
tim lee of the technology liberation front posted an article that questioned the electronic frontier foundations adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies
lees article cited a series of discussions on declan mccullaghs politechbot mailing list on this subject between the effs danny obrien and antispammer suresh ramasubramanian who has also compared the effs tactics in opposing goodmail to tactics used by republican political strategist karl rove
spamassassin developer justin mason posted some criticism of the effs and moveons going overboard in their opposition to the scheme
the dearaolcom campaign lost momentum and disappeared with the last post to the now defunct dearaolcom blog aol starts the shakedown being made on may
comcast who also used the service announced on its website that goodmail had ceased operations and as of february they no longer used the service
on august aol released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing million search keywords for over users over a month period between march and may intended for research purposes
aol pulled the file from public access by august but not before its wide distribution on the internet by others
derivative research titled a picture of search was published by authors pass chowdhury and torgeson for the first international conference on scalable information systems
the data were used by websites such as aolstalker for entertainment purposes where users of aolstalker are encouraged to judge aol clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior
in jason smathers an aol employee was convicted of stealing america onlines million screen names and selling them to a known spammer
smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in
smathers pled guilty to violations of the us can spam act of
he was sentenced in august to months in prison the sentencing judge also recommended smathers be forced to pay in restitution triple the that he sold the addresses for
on february a class action lawsuit was filed against supportcom inc
and partner aol inc
the lawsuit alleged supportcom and aols computer checkup scareware misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers offered to perform a free scan which often found problems with users computers
the companies then offered to sell software for which aol allegedly charged a month and supportcom to remedy those problems
both aol inc
and supportcom inc
settled on may for million
this included to each valid class member and each to consumer watchdog and the electronic frontier foundation
judge jacqueline scott corley wrote distributing a portion of the to consumer watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here and effs mission includes a strong consumer protection component especially in regards to online protection
aol continues to market computer checkup
following media reports about prism nsas massive electronic surveillance program in june several technology companies were identified as participants including aol
according to leaks of said program aol joined the prism program in
at one time most aol users had an online profile hosted by the aol hometown service
when aol hometown was discontinued users had to create a new profile on bebo
this was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with facebook
when the value of bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the million aol paid for it users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again on a new service called aol lifestream
aol took the decision to shut down lifestream on february and gave users one months notice to save photos and videos that had been uploaded to lifestream
following the shutdown aol no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles
during the hometown bebo lifestream era another users profile could be displayed by clicking the buddy info button in the aol desktop software
after the shutdown of lifestream this was no longer supported but opened to the aim home page which also became defunct redirecting to aols home page
the terms and before christ are used to label or number years in the julian and gregorian calendars
the term is medieval latin and means in the year of the lord but is often presented using our lord instead of the lord taken from the full original phrase anno domini nostri jesu christi which translates to in the year of our lord jesus christ
the form bc is specific to english and equivalent abbreviations are used in other languages the latin form is but is rarely seen
this calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of jesus ad counting years from the start of this epoch and bc denoting years before the start of the era
there is no year zero in this scheme thus the year ad immediately follows the year bc
this dating system was devised in by dionysius exiguus but was not widely used until the th century
traditionally english follows latin usage by placing the ad abbreviation before the year number though it is also found after the year
in contrast bc is always placed after the year number which preserves syntactic order
the abbreviation ad is also widely used after the number of a century or millennium as in fourth century ad or second millennium ad
because bc is the english abbreviation for before christ it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that ad means after death which would mean that the approximately years commonly associated with the life of jesus would be included in neither the bc nor the ad time scales
terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non christian people is to call this the current or common era with the preceding years referred to as before the common or current era
astronomical year numbering and iso avoid words or abbreviations related to christianity but use the same numbers for ad years
the anno domini dating system was devised in by dionysius exiguus to enumerate years in his easter table
his system was to replace the diocletian era that had been used in older easter tables as he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted christians
the last year of the old table diocletian anno martyrium was immediately followed by the first year of his table anno domini
when dionysius devised his table julian calendar years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year dionysius himself stated that the present year was the consulship of probus junior which was years since the incarnation of our lord jesus christ
thus dionysius implied that jesus incarnation occurred years earlier without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred
however nowhere in his exposition of his table does dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system whether consulate olympiad year of the world or regnal year of augustus much less does he explain or justify the underlying date
bonnie j
blackburn and leofranc holford strevens briefly present arguments for bc bc or ad as the year dionysius intended for the nativity or incarnation
among the sources of confusion are it is not known how dionysius established the year of jesuss birth
two major theories are that dionysius based his calculation on the gospel of luke which states that jesus was about thirty years old shortly after the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar and hence subtracted thirty years from that date or that dionysius counted back years from the first year of his new table
it has also been speculated by georges declercq that dionysius desire to replace diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world
at the time it was believed by some that the resurrection of the dead and end of the world would occur years after the birth of jesus
the old anno mundi calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the old testament
it was believed that based on the anno mundi calendar jesus was born in the year with the year of the anno mundi calendar marking the end of the world
anno mundi was thus equated with the end of the world but this date had already passed in the time of dionysius
the historia brittonum attributed to nennius written in the th century makes extensive use of the anno passionis dating system which was in common use as well as the newer ad dating system
the ap dating system took its start from the year of the passion
it is generally accepted by experts there is a year difference between ap and ad reference
the anglo saxon historian bede who was familiar with the work of dionysius exiguus used anno domini dating in his ecclesiastical history of the english people which he completed in ad
in the history he also used the latin phrase ante
incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo which is equivalent to the english before christ to identify years before the first year of this era
both dionysius and bede regarded anno domini as beginning at the incarnation of jesus christ but the distinction between incarnation and nativity was not drawn until the late th century when in some places the incarnation epoch was identified with christs conception i
the annunciation on march
on the continent of europe anno domini was introduced as the era of choice of the carolingian renaissance by the english cleric and scholar alcuin in the late eighth century
its endorsement by emperor charlemagne and his successors popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the carolingian empire ultimately lies at the core of the systems prevalence
according to the catholic encyclopedia popes continued to date documents according to regnal years for some time but usage of ad gradually became more common in catholic countries from the th to the th centuries
in portugal became the last western european country to switch to the system begun by dionysius
eastern orthodox countries only began to adopt ad instead of the byzantine calendar in when russia did so with others adopting it in the th and th centuries
although anno domini was in widespread use by the th century the term before christ did not become common until much later
bede used the expression anno
ante incarnationem dominicam twice
anno ante christi nativitatem is found in in a work by a german monk
in the french jesuit theologian denis ptau with his work de doctrina temporum popularized the usage ante christum to mark years prior to ad
when the reckoning from jesus incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western europe various people chose different christian feast days to begin the year christmas annunciation or easter
thus depending on the time and place the year number changed on different days in the year which created slightly different styles in chronology with these various styles the same day could in some cases be dated in or
the date of birth of jesus of nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between bc and bc
the historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating but the date is estimated through two different approaches one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the gospels of luke and matthew and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the ministry of jesus
during the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the christian era european countries used various systems to count years
systems in use included consular dating imperial regnal year dating and creation dating
although the last non imperial consul basilius was appointed in by emperor justinian i later emperors through to constans ii were appointed consuls on the first of january after their accession
all of these emperors except justinian used imperial post consular years for the years of their reign along with their regnal years
long unused this practice was not formally abolished until novell xciv of the law code of leo vi did so in
another calculation had been developed by the alexandrian monk annianus around the year ad placing the annunciation on march ad eight to ten years after the date that dionysius was to imply
although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the byzantine empire years numbered from it an era of incarnation were exclusively used and are still used in ethiopia
this accounts for the seven or eight year discrepancy between the gregorian and ethiopian calendars
byzantine chroniclers like maximus the confessor george syncellus and theophanes dated their years from annianus creation of the world
this era called anno mundi year of the world by modern scholars began its first year on march bc
later byzantine chroniclers used anno mundi years from september bc the byzantine era
no single anno mundi epoch was dominant throughout the christian world
eusebius of caesarea in his chronicle used an era beginning with the birth of abraham dated in bc
spain and portugal continued to date by the spanish era which began counting from bc well into the middle ages
in portugal became the last catholic country to adopt the anno domini system
the era of martyrs which numbered years from the accession of diocletian in who launched the most severe persecution of christians was used by the church of alexandria and is still used officially by the coptic orthodox and coptic catholic churches
it was also used by the ethiopian and eritrean churches
another system was to date from the crucifixion of jesus which as early as hippolytus and tertullian was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the gemini which appears in some medieval manuscripts
alternative names for the anno domini era include vulgaris aerae vulgar era christian era common era and current era
since the alternative abbreviations ce and bce are sometimes used in place of ad and bc
the common current era terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references but still uses the same estimated date of christs birth as the dividing point
for example cunningham and starr write that bce ce do not presuppose faith in christ and hence are more appropriate for interfaith dialog than the conventional bc ad upon its foundation the republic of china adopted the minguo era but used the western calendar for international purposes
the translated term was
later in the peoples republic of china adopted for all purposes domestic and foreign
in the ad year numbering system whether applied to the julian or gregorian calendars ad is immediately preceded by bc with nothing in between them
there are debates as to whether a new decade century or millennium begins on a year ending in zero or one
for computational reasons astronomical year numbering and the iso standard designate years so that ad year bc year bc year etc
in common usage ancient dates are expressed in the julian calendar but iso uses the gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application
thus dates using the year or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to bc or ad
alcuin of york also called ealhwine alhwin or alchoin was a scholar clergyman poet and teacher from york northumbria
he was born around and became the student of archbishop ecgbert at york
at the invitation of charlemagne he became a leading scholar and teacher at the carolingian court where he remained a figure in the s and s
before that he was also a court chancellor in aachen
the most learned man anywhere to be found according to einhards life of charlemagne he is considered among the most important intellectual architects of the carolingian renaissance
among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the carolingian era
during this period he perfected carolingian minuscule an easily read manuscript hand using a mixture of upper and lower case letters
latin paleography in the eighth century leaves little room for a single origin of the script and sources contradict his importance as no proof has been found of his direct involvement in the creation of the script
carolingian minuscule was already in use before alcuin arrived in francia
most likely he was responsible for copying and preserving the script while at the same time restoring the purity of the form
alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems
in he was made abbot of marmoutier abbey in tours where he remained until his death
alcuin was born in northumbria presumably sometime in the s
virtually nothing is known of his parents family background or origin
in common hagiographical fashion the vita alcuini asserts that alcuin was of noble english stock and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars
alcuins own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as wilgils father of the missionary saint willibrord and beornrad abbot of echternach and bishop of sens
willibrord alcuin and beornrad were all related by blood
in his life of st willibrord alcuin writes that wilgils called a paterfamilias had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the humber which had fallen into alcuins possession by inheritance
because in early anglo latin writing paterfamilias usually referred to a donald a
bullough suggests that alcuins family was of status ie free but subordinate to a noble lord and that alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy
if so alcuins origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as deira
the young alcuin came to the cathedral church of york during the golden age of archbishop ecgbert and his brother the northumbrian king eadberht
ecgbert had been a disciple of the venerable bede who urged him to raise york to an archbishopric
king eadberht and archbishop ecgbert oversaw the re energising and reorganisation of the english church with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that bede had begun
ecgbert was devoted to alcuin who thrived under his tutelage
the york school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts literature and science as well as in religious matters
from here alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the frankish court
he revived the school with the trivium and quadrivium disciplines writing a codex on the trivium while his student hraban wrote one on the quadrivium
alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the s
his ascendancy to the headship of the york school the ancestor of st peters school began after aelbert became archbishop of york in
around the same time alcuin became a deacon in the church
he was never ordained a priest
though no real evidence shows that he took monastic vows he lived as if he had
in king elfwald sent alcuin to rome to petition the pope for official confirmation of yorks status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop eanbald i
on his way home he met charlemagne this time in the italian city of parma
alcuins intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join charlemagnes court
he joined an illustrious group of scholars whom charlemagne had gathered around him the mainsprings of the carolingian renaissance peter of pisa paulinus of aquileia rado and abbot fulrad
alcuin would later write the lord was calling me to the service of king charles
alcuin became master of the palace school of charlemagne in aachen in
it had been founded by the kings ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children
however charlemagne wanted to include the liberal arts and most importantly the study of religion
from to alcuin taught charlemagne himself his sons pepin and louis as well as young men sent to be educated at court and the young clerics attached to the palace chapel
bringing with him from york his assistants pyttel sigewulf and joseph alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the palace school introducing charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning to the extent that the institution came to be known as the school of master albinus
in this role as adviser he took issue with the emperors policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death arguing faith is a free act of the will not a forced act
we must appeal to the conscience not compel it by violence
you can force people to be baptised but you cannot force them to believe
his arguments seem to have prevailed charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in
charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court and became far more than just the king at the centre
it seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors
they referred to him as david a reference to the biblical king david
alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with charlemagne and the other men at court where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames
alcuin himself was known as albinus or flaccus
while at aachen alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils derived mainly from virgils eclogues
according to the encyclopdia britannica he loved charlemagne and enjoyed the kings esteem but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love
after the death of pope adrian i alcuin was commissioned by charlemagne to compose an epitaph for adrian
the epitaph was inscribed on black stone quarried at aachen and carried to rome where it was set over adrians tomb in the south transept of st peters basilica just before charlemagnes coronation in the basilica on christmas day
in alcuin returned from the court of charlemagne to england to which he had remained attached
he dwelt there for some time but charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the adoptionist heresy which was at that time making great progress in toledo the old capital of the visigoths and still a major city for the christians under islamic rule in spain
he is believed to have had contacts with beatus of libana from the kingdom of asturias who fought against adoptionism
at the council of frankfurt in alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by felix of urgel an heresiarch according to the catholic encyclopaedia
having failed during his stay in northumbria to influence king thelred in the conduct of his reign alcuin never returned home
he was back at charlemagnes court by at least mid writing a series of letters to thelred to hygbald bishop of lindisfarne and to thelhard archbishop of canterbury in the succeeding months dealing with the viking attack on lindisfarne in july
these letters and alcuins poem on the subject provide the only significant contemporary account of these events
in his description of the viking attack he wrote never before has such terror appeared in britain
behold the church of st cuthbert splattered with the blood of gods priests robbed of its ornaments
in alcuin was in his s
he hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of abbot itherius of saint martin at tours charlemagne put marmoutier abbey into alcuins care with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel
there he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful carolingian minuscule script ancestor of modern roman typefaces
alcuin died on may some years before the emperor and was buried at st
martins church under an epitaph that partly read the majority of details on alcuins life come from his letters and poems
also autobiographical sections are in alcuins poem on york and in the vita alcuini a hagiography written for him at ferrires in the s possibly based in part on the memories of sigwulf one of alcuins pupils
the collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled propositiones ad acuendos juvenes is sometimes attributed to alcuin
in a letter to charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness which some scholars have identified with the propositiones
the text contains about mathematical word problems in no particular pedagogical order
among the most famous of these problems are four that involve river crossings including the problem of three anxious brothers each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled the problem of the wolf goat and cabbage and the problem of the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults
alcuins sequence is the solution to one of the problems of that book
alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it
he had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful calligraphy the carolingian minuscule based on round and legible uncial letters
he wrote many letters to his english friends to arno bishop of salzburg and above all to charlemagne
these letters are filled mainly with pious meditations but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of humanism during the carolingian age
alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety and in the midst of these pursuits he died
alcuin is the most prominent figure of the carolingian renaissance in which three main periods have been distinguished in the first of these up to the arrival of alcuin at the court the italians occupy a central place in the second alcuin and the english are dominant in the third the influence of theodulf the visigoth is preponderant
alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work a grammar and works on rhetoric and dialectics
these are written in the form of a dialogue and in two of them the interlocutors are charlemagne and alcuin
he wrote several theological treatises a de fide trinitatis and commentaries on the bible
alcuin is credited with inventing the first known question mark though it did not resemble the modern symbol
alcuin transmitted to the franks the knowledge of latin culture which had existed in anglo saxon england
a number of his works still exist
besides some graceful epistles in the style of venantius fortunatus he wrote some long poems and notably he is the author of a history of the church at york versus de patribus regibus et sanctis eboracensis ecclesiae
at the same time he is noted for making one of the only explicit comments on old english poetry surviving from the early middle ages in a letter to one speratus the bishop of an unnamed english see
historian john boswell cited alcuins writings as demonstrating a personal outpouring of his internalized homosexual feelings
others agree that alcuin at times comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires and this reflects the erotic subculture of the carolingian monastic school but also perhaps a queer space where erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated
according to david clark passages in some of alcuins writings can be seen to display homosocial desire even possibly homoerotic imagery
however he argues that it is not possible to necessarily determine whether they were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings on the part of alcuin
the interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by allen frantzen who identifies alcuins language with that of medieval christian amicitia or friendship
douglas dales and rowan williams say the use of language drawn alcuin from the song of songs transforms apparently erotic language into something within christian friendship an ordained affection
alcuin was also a close friend of charlemagnes sister gisela abbess of chelles and he hailed her as a noble sister in the bond of sweet love
he wrote to charlemagnes daughters rotrude and bertha the devotion of my heart specially tends towards you both because of the familiarity and dedication you have shown me
he dedicated the last two books of his commentary on johns gospel to them both
despite inconclusive evidence of alcuins personal passions he was clear in his own writings that the men of sodom had been punished with fire for sinning against nature with men a view commonly held by the church at the time
such sins argued alcuin were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the flood and merit to be withered by flames unto eternal barrenness
alcuin is honored in the church of england and in the episcopal church on may the first available day after the day of his death
alcuin college one of the colleges of the university of york is named after him
in january alcuin was the subject of the bbc radio programme in our time

angilbert was a noble frankish poet who was educated under alcuin and served charlemagne as a secretary diplomat and son in law
he is venerated as a pre congregation saint and is still honored on the day of his death february
angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of charlemagne at the palace school in aquae granni
he was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great english scholar alcuin
when charlemagne sent his young son pepin to italy as king of the lombards angilbert went along as primicerius palatii a high administrator of the satellite court
as the friend and adviser of pepin he assisted for a while in the government of italy
angilbert delivered the document on iconoclasm from the frankish synod of frankfurt to pope adrian i and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope in and
at one time he served an officer of the maritime provinces
he accompanied charlemagne to rome in and was one of the witnesses to his will in
there are various traditions concerning angilberts relationship with bertha daughter of charlemagne
one holds that they were married another that they were not
they had however at least two sons and one daughter one of whom nithard became a notable figure in the mid th century while their daughter bertha went on to marry helgaud ii count of ponthieu
control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the middle ages
bertha and angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices
on the other hand some historians have speculated that charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands none of charlemagnes daughters were married despite political offers of arranged marriages
in angilbert retired to the abbey of centulum the monastery of st richarius at present day saint riquier in picardy
elected abbot in he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of volumes
it was not uncommon for the merovingian carolingian or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation
angilbert in contrast spent a great deal rebuilding saint riquier when he completed it charlemagne spent easter of the year there
in keeping with carolingian policies angilbert established a school at saint riquier to educate the local boys
angilberts latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family
charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames
charlemagne was referred to as david a reference to the biblical king david
angilbert was nicknamed homer because he wrote poetry and was the probable author of an epic of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between charlemagne and leo iii
it is a mosaic from virgil ovid lucan and venantius fortunatus composed in the manner of einhards use of suetonius
of the shorter poems besides the greeting to pippin on his return from the campaign against the avars an epistle to david incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperors palace
the reference to bertha however is distant and respectful her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation
the poem de conversione saxonum has been attributed to angilbert
angilberts poems were published by ernst dmmler in the monumenta germaniae historica

in chemistry amines are compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with a lone pair
amines are formally derivatives of ammonia wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group
important amines include amino acids biogenic amines trimethylamine and aniline
inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called amines such as monochloramine
the substituent is called an amino group
compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group thus having the structure are called amides and have different chemical properties from amines
amines can be classified according to the nature and number of substituents on nitrogen
aliphatic amines contain only h and alkyl substituents
aromatic amines have the nitrogen atom connected to an aromatic ring
it is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen
these species are not amines but are quaternary ammonium cations and have a charged nitrogen center
quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions
amines are named in several ways
typically the compound is given the prefix amino or the suffix amine
the prefix n shows substitution on the nitrogen atom
an organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine triamine tetraamine and so forth
hydrogen bonding significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines
for example methyl and ethyl amines are gases under standard conditions whereas the corresponding methyl and ethyl alcohols are liquids
amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell liquid amines have a distinctive fishy and foul smell
the nitrogen atom features a lone electron pair that can bind h to form an ammonium ion rnh
the lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the n
the water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone electron pairs
typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water primary ammonium secondary ammonium tertiary ammonium
small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic
aromatic amines such as aniline have their lone pair electrons conjugated into the benzene ring thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished
their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low
typically the presence of an amine functional group is deduced by a combination of techniques including mass spectrometry as well as nmr and ir spectroscopies
h nmr signals for amines disappear upon treatment of the sample with do
in their infrared spectrum primary amines exhibit two n h bands whereas secondary amines exhibit only one
alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers
c n c and c n h angles approach the idealized angle of
c n distances are slightly shorter than c c distances
the energy barrier for the nitrogen inversion of the stereocenter is about kcal mol for a trialkylamine
the interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind
amines of the type nhrr and nrrr are chiral the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair
because of the low barrier to inversion amines of the type nhrr cannot be obtained in optical purity
for chiral tertiary amines nrrr can only be resolved when the r r and r groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as n substituted aziridines
in aromatic amines nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent
the c n distance is correspondingly shorter
in aniline the c n distance is the same as the c c distances
like ammonia amines are bases
compared to alkali metal hydroxides amines are weaker
owing to inductive effects the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine
correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects
solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines
for anilines the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalizes into the ring resulting in decreased basicity
substituents on the aromatic ring and their positions relative to the amino group also affect basicity as seen in the table
solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines
n h groups strongly interact with water especially in ammonium ions
consequently the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by by solvation
the intrinsic basicity of amines ie the situation where solvation is unimportant has been evaluated in the gas phase
in the gas phase amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron releasing effects of the organic substituents
thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines which are more basic than primary amines and finally ammonia is least basic
the order of pkbs does not follow this order
similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution
in aprotic polar solvents such as dmso dmf and acetonitrile the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol
for this reason the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic effects
in such reactions which are more useful for alkyl iodides and bromides the degree of alkylation is difficult to control such that one obtains mixtures of primary secondary and tertiary amines as well as quaternary ammonium salts
selectivity can be improved via the delpine reaction although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale
selectivity is also assured in the gabriel synthesis which involves organohalide reacting with potassium phthalimide
aryl halides are much less reactive toward amines and for that reason are more controllable
a popular way to prepare aryl amines is the buchwald hartwig reaction
disubstituted alkenes react with hcn in the presence of strong acids to give formamides which can be decarbonylated
this method the ritter reaction is used industrially to produce tertiary amines such a tert octylamine
hydroamination of alkenes is also widely practiced
the reaction is catalyzed by zeolite based solid acids
via the process of hydrogenation unsaturated n containing functional groups are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst
suitable groups include nitriles azides imines including oximes amides and nitro
in the case of nitriles reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions which can cause hydrolysis of the group
is more commonly employed for the reduction of these same groups on the laboratory scale
many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via reductive amination which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically
aniline and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics
in industry hydrogen is the preferred reductant whereas in the laboratory tin and iron are often employed
many methods exist for the preparation of amines many of these methods being rather specialized
aside from their basicity the dominant reactivity of amines is their nucleophilicity
most primary amines are good ligands for metal ions to give coordination complexes
amines are alkylated by alkyl halides
acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides react with primary and secondary amines to form amides
similarly with sulfonyl chlorides one obtains sulfonamides
this transformation known as the hinsberg reaction is a chemical test for the presence of amines
because amines are basic they neutralize acids to form the corresponding ammonium salts
when formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding amides
alkyl amines protonate near ph to give alkylammonium derivative
amines reacts with nitrous acid to give diazonium salts
the alkyl diazonium salts are of little importance because they are too unstable
the most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as aniline anilines and naphthylamines form more stable diazonium salts which can be isolated in the crystalline form
diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the group with anions
for example cuprous cyanide gives the corresponding nitriles aryldiazonium couple with electron rich aromatic compounds such as a phenol to form azo compounds
such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes
imine formation is an important reaction
primary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form imines
in the case of formaldehyde these products typically exist as cyclic trimers
amines are ubiquitous in biology
the breakdown of amino acids releases amines famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of trimethylamine
many neurotransmitters are amines including epinephrine norepinephrine dopamine serotonin and histamine
protonated amino groups are the most common positively charged moieties in proteins specifically in the amino acid lysine
the anionic polymer dna is typically bound to various amine rich proteins
additionally the terminal charged primary ammonium on lysine forms salt bridges with carboxylate groups of other amino acids in polypeptides which is one of the primary influences on the three dimensional structures of proteins
primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of azo dyes
it reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound
as azo compounds are highly coloured they are widely used in dyeing industries such as aqueous monoethanolamine diglycolamine diethanolamine diisopropanolamine and methyldiethanolamine are widely used industrially for removing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas and refinery process streams
they may also be used to remove co from combustion gases and flue gases and may have potential for abatement of greenhouse gases
related processes are known as sweetening
amines are often used as epoxy resin curing agents
these include dimethylethylamine cyclohexylamine and a variety of diamines such as diaminodicyclohexylmethane
multifunctional amines such as tetraethylenepentamine and triethylenetetramine are also widely used in this capacity
the reaction proceeds by the lone pair of electrons on the amine nitrogen attacking the outermost carbon on the oxirane ring of the epoxy resin
this relieves ring strain on the epoxide and is the driving force of the reaction
low molecular weight simple amines such as ethylamine are only weakly toxic with between and mg kg
they are skin irritants especially as some are easily absorbed through the skin
amines are a broad class of compounds and more complex members of the class can be extremely bioactive for example strychnine
absolute zero is the lowest limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value taken as zero kelvin
the fundamental particles of nature have minimum vibrational motion retaining only quantum mechanical zero point energy induced particle motion
the theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law by international agreement absolute zero is taken as degrees on the celsius scale which equals degrees on the fahrenheit scale
the corresponding kelvin and rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition
it is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid and then to solid and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization and enthalpy of fusion exceeds the ideal gass change in enthalpy to absolute zero
in the quantum mechanical description matter at absolute zero is in its ground state the point of lowest internal energy
the laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically
even a system at absolute zero if it could somehow be achieved would still possess quantum mechanical zero point energy the energy of its ground state at absolute zero the kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed
scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero where matter exhibits quantum effects such as bose einstein condensate superconductivity and superfluidity
at temperatures near nearly all molecular motion ceases and s for any adiabatic process where s is the entropy
in such a circumstance pure substances can form perfect crystals with no structural imperfections as t
max plancks strong form of the third law of thermodynamics states the entropy of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero
the original nernst heat theorem makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any isothermal process approaches zero as t the implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value
an adiabat is a state with constant entropy typically represented on a graph as a curve in a manner similar to isotherms and isobars
the nernst postulate identifies the isotherm t as coincident with the adiabat s although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct
as no two adiabats intersect no other adiabat can intersect the t isotherm
consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature
a perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure extends uninterrupted in all directions
the perfect order can be represented by translational symmetry along three axes
every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping
for substances that exist in two stable crystalline forms such as diamond and graphite for carbon there is a kind of chemical degeneracy
the question remains whether both can have zero entropy at t even though each is perfectly ordered
perfect crystals never occur in practice imperfections and even entire amorphous material inclusions can and do get frozen in at low temperatures so transitions to more stable states do not occur
using the debye model the specific heat and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to t while the enthalpy and chemical potential are proportional to t
these quantities drop toward their t limiting values and approach with zero slopes
for the specific heats at least the limiting value itself is definitely zero as borne out by experiments to below k
even the less detailed einstein model shows this curious drop in specific heats
in fact all specific heats vanish at absolute zero not just those of crystals
likewise for the coefficient of thermal expansion
maxwells relations show that various other quantities also vanish
these phenomena were unanticipated
since the relation between changes in gibbs free energy the enthalpy and the entropy is thus as t decreases g and h approach each other
experimentally it is found that all spontaneous processes result in a decrease in g as they proceed toward equilibrium
if s and or t are small the condition g tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on acapulco bay
about seventy three percent of the municipalitys population is involved in commerce most of it related to tourism and the port
mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture
industrial production is limited mostly to bottling milk products cement products and ice and energy production
agricultural products include tomatoes corn watermelon beans green chili peppers and melons
acapulco is one of mexicos oldest coastal tourist destinations reaching prominence in the s as the place where hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale
in modern times tourists in acapulco have been facing problems with corrupt local police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail
the city is divided into three tourist areas
traditional acapulco is the old part of the port where hotels like hotel los flamingos owned by personalities johnny weissmuller and john wayne are located is on the northern end of the bay
anchored by attractions such as the beaches of caleta and caletilla the cliff divers of la quebrada and the city square known as el zocalo
the heyday of this part of acapulco ran from the late s until the s with development continuing through the s
this older section of town now caters to a mostly middle class almost exclusively mexican clientele while the glitzier newer section caters to the mexican upper classes many of whom never venture into the older traditional part of town
acapulco dorado had its development between the s and the s and is about minutes from the acapulco international airport
it is the area that presents the most tourist influx in the port runs through much of the acapulco bay from icacos passing through costera miguel aleman avenue which is the main one to papagayo park
it has several hotels acapulco diamante also known as punta diamante is the newest and most developed part of the port with investment having created one of the greatest concentrations of luxury facilities in mexico including exclusive hotels and resorts of international chains residential complexes luxury condominiums and private villas spas restaurants shopping areas and a golf course
starting at the scenic highway in las brisas it includes puerto marqus and punta diamante and extends to barra vieja beach
it is minutes from the acapulco international airport
in this area all along boulevard de las naciones almost all transportation is by car limousine or golf cart
acapulcos reputation of a high energy party town and the nightlife have long been draws of the city for tourists
from november to april luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the the crystal harmony and all the princess line ships
despite acapulcos international fame most of its visitors are from central mexico especially the affluent from mexico city
acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the mexican cruise line ocean star cruises
for the christmas season of acapulco received visitors most of whom are mexican nationals adding million pesos to the economy
eighty percent arrive by land and eighteen percent by air
the area has over condominiums most of which function as second homes for their mexican owners
acapulco is still popular with mexican celebrities and the wealthy such as luis miguel and plcido domingo who maintain homes there
from the latter th century on the city has also taken on other less positive reputations
some consider it a pass resort eclipsed by the newer cancn and cabo san lucas
over the years a number of problems have developed here especially in the bay and the older sections of the city
the large number of wandering vendors on the beaches who offer everything from newspapers to massages are a recognized problem
it is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach but the government says it is difficult to eradicate as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty in the city
around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides populated by migrants who have come to the city looking for work
in the last decade drug related violence has caused massive problems for the local tourism trade
another problem is the garbage that has accumulated in the bay
although tons have recently been extracted from the bays of acapulco and nearby zihuatanejo more needs to be done
most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them
however the center of the bay is not touched
the reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common in the city to throw it in streets rivers and the bay itself
the most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires
acapulco has seen some success in this area having several beaches receiving the high blue flag certifications for cleanliness and water quality
acapulcos cuisine is very rich
the following are typical dishes from the region relleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes raisins carrots and chiles
it is eaten with bread called bolillo
pozole is a soup with a salsa base hominy meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with antojitos like tostadas tacos and tamales
this dish is served as part of a weekly thursday event in the city and the state with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators
acapulcos main attraction is its nightlife as it has been for many decades
nightclubs change names and owners frequently
for example baby o has been open to the national and international public since and different celebrities have visited their installations such as mexican singer luis miguel bono from u and sylvester stallone
another nightclub is palladium located in the escnica avenue the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the santa lucia bay at night
various djs have had performances in palladium among them dvbbs tom swoon nervo and junkie kid
informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment
in addition there is the beach bar zone where younger crowds go
these are located along the costera road face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock
most are concentrated between the fiesta americana and continental plaza hotels
these places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress
there is a bungee jump in this area as well
another attraction at acapulco is the la quebrada cliff divers
the tradition started in the s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below
eventually locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive
today the divers are professionals diving from heights of into an inlet that is only wide and deep after praying first at a shrine to the virgin of guadalupe
on the evening before december the feast day of this virgin freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her
dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the ocean of fire when the sea is lit with gasoline making a circle of flames which the diver aims for
the spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the hotel plaza las glorias el mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace
there are a number of beaches in the acapulco bay and the immediate coastline
in the bay proper there are the la angosta caleta caletilla dominguillo tlacopanocha hornos hornitos honda tamarindo condesa guitarrn icacos playuela playuelilla and playa del secreto
in the adjoining smaller bay of puerto marqus there is pichilingue las brisas and playa roqueta
facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is pie de la cuesta and southeast are playa revolcadero playa aeromar playa encantada and barra vieja
two lagoons are in the area coyuca to the northwest of acapulco bay and tres palos to the southeast
both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours
tres palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected
in addition to sunbathing the beaches around the bay offer a number of services such as boat rentals boat tours horseback riding scuba diving and other aquatic sports
one popular cruise is from caletilla beach to roqueta island which has places to snorkel have lunch and a lighthouse
there is also an underwater statue of the virgin of guadalupe here created in by armando quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here
many of the scuba diving tours come to this area as well where there are sunken ships sea mountains and cave rock formations
another popular activity is deep sea fishing
the major attraction is sail fishing
fish caught here have weighed between and pounds
sailfish are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything the trip is free
in the old part of the city there is a traditional main square called the zcalo lined with shade trees cafs and shops
at the north end of the square is nuestra seora de la soledad cathedral with blue onion shaped domes and byzantine towers
the building was originally constructed as a movie set but was later adapted into a church
acapulcos most historic building is the fort of san diego located east of the main square and originally built in to protect the city from pirate attacks
the fort was partially destroyed by the dutch in the mid th century rebuilt then destroyed again in by an earthquake
it was rebuilt again by and this is the building that can be seen today unchanged except for renovations done to it in
parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements
today the fort serves as the museo histrico de acapulco which shows the ports history from the pre hispanic period until independence
there are temporary exhibits as well
for many years tourists could ride around the city in colorful horse drawn carriages known as calandrias but the practice ended in february due to concerns about mistreatment of the animals
the el rollo acapulco is a sea life and aquatic park located on costera miguel aleman
it offers wave pools water slides and water toboggans
there are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program
the center mostly caters to children
another place that is popular with children is the parque papagayo a large family park which has a life sized replica of a spanish galleon three artificial lakes an aviary a skating rink rides go karts and more
the dolores olmedo house is located in the traditional downtown of acapulco and is noted for the murals by diego rivera that adorn it
olmedo and rivera had been friend since olmedo was a child and rivera spent the last two years of his life here
during that time he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics featuring aztec deities such as quetzalcoatl
the interior of the home is covered in murals
the home is not a museum so only the outside murals can be seen by the public
there is a small museum called casa de la mscara which is dedicated to masks most of them from mexico but there are examples from many parts of the world
the collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called masks of the world mexico across history the huichols and the jaguar alebrijes dances of guerrero devils and death identity and fantasy and afro indian masks
the botanical garden of acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the universidad loyola del pacfico
most of the plants here are native to the region and many such as the peltogyne mexicana or purple stick tree are in danger of extinction
one cultural event that is held yearly in acapulco is the festival internacional de la nao which takes place in the fort of san diego located near the zcalo in downtown of the city
the festival honors the remembrance of the citys interaction and trades with oriental territories which started back in the sixteenth century
the nao festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from india china japan philippines thailand indonesia and south korea
the variety of events go from film projections musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes some of the events are specifically for kids
the annual french festival takes place throughout acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between mexico and france
the main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair
the cinpolis galeras diana and the teatro juan ruz de alarcn present french and french literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects
even some of the local nightclubs feature french djs
other festivals celebrated here include carnival the feast of san isidro labrador on may and in november a crafts and livestock fair called the nao de china
there are a number of golf courses in acapulco including the acapulco princess and the pierre marqus course the latter designed by robert trent jones in for the world cup golf tournament
the mayan palace course was designed by pedro guericia and an economical course called the club de golf acapulco is near the convention center
the most exclusive course is that of the tres vidas golf club designed by robert von hagge
it is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds
another famous sport tournament that has been held in acapulco since is the abierto mexicano telcel tennis tournament an atp event that takes place in the tennis courts of the princess mundo imperial a resort located in the diamante zone of acapulco
initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court
the event has gained popularity within the passing of the years attracting some of the top tennis players in the world including novak djokovic rafael nadal and marin cilic
the total prize money is us for wta and us for atp
acapulco also has a bullring called the plaza de toros near caletilla beach
the season runs during the winter and is called the fiesta brava
before over american teenagers and young adults traveled to resort areas and balnearios throughout mexico during spring break each year
the main reason students head to mexico is the drinking age of years something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean
this has become attractive since the s especially since more traditional spring break places such as daytona beach florida have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors
this legislation has pushed spring break tourism to various parts of mexico with acapulco as one of the top destinations
in the late s and early s cancn had been favored as the spring break destination of choice
however cancn has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event and students have been looking for someplace new
this led many more to choose acapulco in spite of the fact that for many travelers the flight is longer and more expensive than to cancn
many were attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and acapulcos famous nightlife
in students came to acapulco for spring break
hotels did not get that many in due mostly to the economic situation in the united states and partially because of scares of drug related violence
in february the us state department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to acapulco
the warning a result of violent activity springing from mexicos drug cartel dbcle took college campuses by storm with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to mexico over spring break
bill oreilly devoted a segment of his show the oreilly factor to urge students to stay away from acapulco
in june a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government
these included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets involving large caliber weapons and grenades
however no incidents of violence against travelers on spring break were reported
nine passenger airlines including four international ones fly to acapulco international airport
in the city there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations
however an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized colectivo cab system
these cabs cost pesos per person to ride but they are not private
the driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available and will transport them to their destination based on first come first served rules
the colectivos each travel a designated area of the city the three main ones being costera colosio coloso or a mixture of the three
coloso cabs travel mainly to old acapulco
colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of acapulco
costera cabs drive up and down the coast of acapulco where most of the hotels for visitors are located but which includes some of old acapulco
where a driver will take you is partly his choice
some are willing to travel to the other designated areas especially during slow periods of the day
the bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider
as far as transportation goes it is the cheapest form other than walking in acapulco
the most expensive buses have air conditioning while the cheaper buses do not
for tourists the acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with acapulco painted on the side of them
these buses are not for tourists only but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems
these buses travel the tourist section of acapulco driving up and down the coast
there are buses with specific routes and destinations generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat
perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized with decals and home made interior designs that range from comic book scenes to pornography and even to hello kitty themes
the conflictive public transportation would be upgraded on june with the implementation of the
the acabs infrastructure has a length of with stations spread throughout the city of acapulco and has five routes
this project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers
in the idea to nominate the manila acapulco galleon trade route was initiated by the mexican ambassador to unesco with the filipino ambassador to unesco

alan curtis kay is an american computer scientist best known for his pioneering work on object oriented programming and windowing graphical user interface design
at xerox parc he led the design and development of the first modern windowed computer desktop interface
there he also led the development of the influential object oriented programming language smalltalk both personally designing most of the early versions of the language and coining the term object oriented
he has been elected a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences the national academy of engineering and the royal society of arts
he received the turing award in
kay is also a former professional jazz guitarist composer and theatrical designer
he also is an amateur classical pipe organist
in an interview on education in america with the davis group ltd
kay said originally from springfield massachusetts kays family relocated several times due to his fathers career in physiology before ultimately settling in the new york metropolitan area
he attended brooklyn technical high school
having accumulated enough credits to graduate he then attended bethany college in bethany west virginia where he majored in biology and minored in mathematics
kay then taught guitar in denver colorado for a year
he was drafted in the united states army then qualified for officer training in the united states air force where he became a computer programmer after passing an aptitude test
after his discharge he enrolled at the university of colorado boulder and earned a bachelor of science in mathematics and molecular biology in
in the autumn of he began graduate school at the university of utah college of engineering
he earned a master of science in electrical engineering in then a doctor of philosophy in computer science in
his doctoral dissertation flex a flexible extendable language described the invention of a computer language named flex
while there he worked with fathers of computer graphics david c
evans and ivan sutherland
kay credits sutherlands thesis for influencing his views on objects and computer programming
as he grew busier with research for the defense advanced research projects agency he ended his musical career
in he met seymour papert and learned of the programming language logo a dialect of lisp optimized for educational purposes
this led him to learn of the work of jean piaget jerome bruner lev vygotsky and of constructionist learning further influencing his professional orientation
in kay became a visiting researcher at the stanford artificial intelligence laboratory in anticipation of accepting a professorship at carnegie mellon university
instead in he joined the xerox parc research staff in palo alto california
through the decade he developed prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language smalltalk
along with some colleagues at parc kay is one of the fathers of the idea of object oriented programming which he named
some original object oriented concepts including the use of the words object and class had been developed for simula at the norwegian computing center
kay said im sorry that i long ago coined the term objects for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea
the big idea is messaging
while at parc kay conceived the dynabook concept a key progenitor of laptop and tablet computers and the e book
he is also the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface
because the dynabook was conceived as an educational platform he is considered one of the first researchers into mobile learning many features of the dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the one laptop per child educational platform with which kay is actively involved
from to kay was chief scientist at atari
in he became an apple fellow
after the closure of the apple advanced technology group in he was recruited by his friend bran ferren head of research and development at disney to join walt disney imagineering as a disney fellow
he remained there until ferren left to start applied minds inc with imagineer danny hillis leading to the cessation of the fellows program
in kay founded viewpoints research institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to children learning and advanced software development
for their first ten years kay and his viewpoints group were based at applied minds in glendale california where he and ferren worked on various projects
kay served as president of the institute until its closure in
in kay joined hp labs as a senior fellow departing when hp disbanded the advanced software research team on july
he has been an adjunct professor of computer science at the university of california los angeles a visiting professor at kyoto university and an adjunct professor at the massachusetts institute of technology
kay served on the advisory board of tti vanguard
in december while still at apple kay collaborated with many others to start the open source squeak version of smalltalk
as part of this effort in november his team began research on what became the etoys system
more recently he started with david a
smith david p
reed andreas raab rick mcgeer julian lombardi and mark mccahill the croquet project an open source networked d and d environment for collaborative work
in it became clear that the etoy architecture in squeak had reached its limits in what the morphic interface infrastructure could do
andreas raab a researcher in kays group then at hewlett packard proposed defining a script process and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoided several more general problems
the result was a new user interface proposed to replace the squeak morphic user interface
tweak added mechanisms of islands asynchronous messaging players and costumes language extensions projects and tile scripting
its underlying object system is class based but to users it acts as if it were prototype based
tweak objects are created and run in tweak project windows
in november at the world summit on the information society the mit research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer for educational use around the world
it has many names including the laptop the one laptop per child program the childrens machine and the xo
the program was founded and is sustained by kays friend nicholas negroponte and is based on kays dynabook ideal
kay is a prominent co developer of the computer focusing on its educational software using squeak and etoys
kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented
his lectures at the oopsla conference and his acm turing award talk the computer revolution hasnt happened yet were informed by his experiences with sketchpad simula smalltalk and the bloated code of commercial software
on august kays proposal to the united states national science foundation was granted funding viewpoints research institute for several years
the proposal title was steps toward the reinvention of programming a compact and practical model of personal computing as a self exploratorium
a sense of what kay is trying to do comes from this quote from the abstract of a seminar at intel research labs berkeley the conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days
we wonder how small could be an understandable practical model t design that covers this functionality m lines of code k loc k loc k loc his other honors include the j d warnier prix dinformatique the acm systems software award the nec computers communication foundation prize the funai foundation prize the lewis branscomb technology award and the acm sigcse award for outstanding contributions to computer science education
apl is a programming language developed in the s by kenneth e
its central datatype is the multidimensional array
it uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators leading to very concise code
it has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling spreadsheets functional programming and computer math packages
it has also inspired several other programming languages
a mathematical notation for manipulating arrays was developed by kenneth e
iverson starting in at harvard university
in he began work for ibm where he developed this notation with adin falkoff and published it in his book a programming language in
the preface states its premise this notation was used inside ibm for short research reports on computer systems such as the burroughs b and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus register machines were being evaluated by ibm for upcoming computers
iverson also used his notation in a draft of the chapter a programming language written for a book he was writing with fred brooks automatic data processing which would be published in
in iverson received the turing award for his work on apl
as early as the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after falkoff discussed with william c
carter his work to standardize the instruction set for the machines that later became the ibm system family
in herbert hellerman working at the ibm systems research institute implemented a part of the notation on an ibm computer and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation
students tested their code in hellermans lab
this implementation of a part of the notation was called personalized array translator
in falkoff iverson and edward h
sussenguth jr all working at ibm used the notation for a formal description of the ibm system series machine architecture and functionality which resulted in a paper published in ibm systems journal in
after this was published the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system
one of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of john l
lawrence who had new duties with science research associates an educational company bought by ibm in
lawrence asked iverson and his group to help use the language as a tool to develop and use computers in education
after lawrence m
breed and philip s
abrams of stanford university joined the team at ibm research they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in fortran iv for a part of the notation which had been done for the ibm computer running on the ibsys operating system
this work was finished in late and later named ivsys
the basis of this implementation was described in detail by abrams in a stanford university technical report an interpreter for iverson notation in the academic aspect of this was formally supervised by niklaus wirth
like hellermans pat system earlier this implementation did not include the apl character set but used special english reserved words for functions and operators
the system was later adapted for a time sharing system and by november it had been reprogrammed for the ibm system model computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at ibm
a key development in the ability to use apl effectively before the wide use of cathode ray tube terminals was the development of a special ibm selectric typewriter interchangeable typing element with all the special apl characters on it
this was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the selectric typewriter and typing element mechanism such as the ibm and ibm terminal
keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which apl characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck
for the first time a programmer could type in and see proper apl characters as used in iversons notation and not be forced to use awkward english keyword representations of them
falkoff and iverson had the special apl selectric typing elements and designed in late although no apl computer system was available to use them
iverson cited falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an ibm selectric typing element for the apl character set
many apl symbols even with the apl characters on the selectric typing element still had to be typed in by over striking two extant element characters
an example is the grade up character which had to be made from a delta and a sheffer stroke
this was necessary because the apl character set was much larger than the characters allowed on the typing element even when letters were restricted to upper case
the first apl interactive login and creation of an apl workspace was in by larry breed using an ibm terminal at the ibm mohansic labs near thomas j
watson research center the home of apl in yorktown heights new york
ibm was chiefly responsible for introducing apl to the marketplace
the first publicly available version of apl was released in for the ibm
ibm provided apl for free but without liability or support
it would run in as little as k bit words of memory and used a dedicated megabyte hard disk
apl gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late s through the early s in part because it would support multiple users on lower specification systems that had no dynamic address translation hardware
additional improvements in performance for selected ibm system mainframe systems included the apl assist microcode in which some support for apl execution was included in the processors firmware as distinct from being implemented entirely by higher level software
somewhat later as suitably performing hardware was finally growing available in the mid to late s many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment
early ibm apl interpreters for ibm and ibm hardware implemented their own multi user management instead of relying on the host services thus they were their own timesharing systems
first introduced for use at ibm in the apl system was a multi user interpreter
the ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged i beam functions using both monadic and dyadic operations
in ibm released aplsv which was a continuation of the same product but which offered shared variables as a means to access facilities outside of the apl system such as operating system files
in the mid s the ibm mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the ibm desktop computer which had a small crt and an apl keyboard when most other small computers of the time only offered basic
in the s the vsapl program product enjoyed wide use with conversational monitor system time sharing option vspc music sp and cics users
in patrick e
hagerty directed the implementation of the university of maryland apl interpreter for the line of the sperry univac series mainframe computers
at the time sperry had nothing
in student alan stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function
xerox apl was available from june for xerox and sigma and mainframes running cp v and for honeywell cp
in the s and s several timesharing firms arose that sold apl services using modified versions of the ibm apl interpreter
in north america the better known ones were ip sharp associates scientific time sharing corporation time sharing resources and the computer company
compuserve also entered the market in with an apl interpreter based on a modified version of digital equipment corp and carnegie mellons which ran on decs ki and kl bit machines
compuserves apl was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service
with the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the ibm and later the personal computer by the mid s the timesharing industry was all but gone
sharp apl was available from ip sharp associates first as a timesharing service in the s and later as a program product starting around
sharp apl was an advanced apl implementation with many language extensions such as packages file system nested arrays and shared variables
apl interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini computer manufacturers also notably burroughs control data corporation data general digital equipment corporation harris hewlett packard siemens xerox and others
garth foster of syracuse university sponsored regular meetings of the apl implementers community at syracuses minnowbrook conference center in blue mountain lake new york
in later years eugene mcdonnell organized similar meetings at the asilomar conference grounds near monterey california and at pajaro dunes near watsonville california
the sigapl special interest group of the association for computing machinery continues to support the apl community
on microcomputers which became available from the mid s onwards basic became the dominant programming language
nevertheless some microcomputers provided apl instead the first being the intel based mcm which was released in and which was primarily used in education
another machine of this time was the videobrain family computer released in which was supplied with its dialect of apl called apl s
the commodore superpet introduced in included an apl interpreter developed by the university of waterloo
in bill gates claimed in his open letter to hobbyists that microsoft corporation was implementing apl for the intel and motorola but had very little incentive to make available to hobbyists because of software piracy
it was never released
starting in the early s ibm apl development under the leadership of jim brown implemented a new version of the apl language that contained as its primary enhancement the concept of nested arrays where an array can contain other arrays and new language features which facilitated integrating nested arrays into program workflow
ken iverson no longer in control of the development of the apl language left ibm and joined i
sharp associates where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of sharp apl to be more in accord with his vision
apl was first released for cms and tso in
the apl workstation edition followed later
as other vendors were busy developing apl interpreters for new hardware notably unix based microcomputers apl was almost always the standard chosen for new apl interpreter developments
even today most apl vendors or their users cite apl compatibility as a selling point for those products
ibm cites its use for problem solving system design prototyping engineering and scientific computations expert systems for teaching mathematics and other subjects visualization and database access
various implementations of apl by aplx dyalog et al
include extensions for object oriented programming support for net xml array conversion primitives graphing operating system interfaces and lambda calculus expressions
freeware versions include gnu apl for linux and nars for windows
both of these are fairly complete versions of apl with various language extensions
apl has been criticized and praised for its choice of a unique non standard character set
some who learn it become ardent adherents
in the s and s few terminal devices or even displays could reproduce the apl character set
the most popular ones employed the ibm selectric print mechanism used with a special apl type element
one of the early apl line terminals was the texas instruments ti model with the full apl character set which featured half and full duplex telecommunications modes for interacting with an apl time sharing service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job called an rje
over time with the universal use of high quality graphic displays printing devices and unicode support the apl character font problem has largely been eliminated
however entering apl characters requires the use of input method editors keyboard mappings virtual on screen apl symbol sets or easy reference printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages
with beginners who have no prior experience with other programming languages a study involving high school students found that typing and using apl characters did not hinder the students in any measurable way
in defense of apl it requires fewer characters to type and keyboard mappings become memorized over time
special apl keyboards are also made and in use today as are freely downloadable fonts for operating systems such as microsoft windows
the reported productivity gains assume that one spends enough time working in the language to make it worthwhile to memorize the symbols their semantics and keyboard mappings not to mention a substantial number of idioms for common tasks
unlike traditionally structured programming languages apl code is typically structured as chains of monadic or dyadic functions and operators acting on arrays
apl has many nonstandard primitives that are indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols
all primitives are defined to have the same precedence and always associate to the right
thus apl is read or best understood from right to left
early apl implementations had no programming loop flow control structures such as codice or codice loops and codice constructs
instead they used array operations and use of structured programming constructs was often not necessary since an operation could be performed on a full array in one statement
for example the codice function can replace for loop iteration n when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one dimensional array
more recent implementations of apl generally include comprehensive control structures so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated
the apl environment is called a workspace
in a workspace the user can define programs and data ie the data values exist also outside the programs and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program
in the examples below the apl interpreter first types six spaces before awaiting the users input
its own output starts in column one
the user can save the workspace with all values programs and execution status
apl uses a set of non ascii symbols which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation
having single character names for single instruction multiple data vector functions is one way that apl enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing conways game of life in one line of code
in nearly all versions of apl it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression that is in one line of code
because of the unusual character set many programmers use special keyboards with apl keytops to write apl code
although there are various ways to write apl code using only ascii characters in practice it is almost never done
most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts with special mappings or input method editors to access non ascii characters
historically the apl font has been distinctive with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols
most vendors continue to display the apl character set in a custom font
advocates of apl claim that the examples of so called write only code are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes which can occur in any language
advocates also claim that they are far more productive with apl than with more conventional computer languages and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology
they also may claim that because it is compact and terse apl lends itself well to larger scale software development and complexity because the number of lines of code can be reduced greatly
many apl advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as cobol and java as being comparatively tedious
apl is often found where time to market is important such as with trading systems
apl makes a clear distinction between functions and operators
functions take arrays as arguments and return arrays as results
operators take functions or arrays as arguments and derive related functions
for example the sum function is derived by applying the reduction operator to the addition function
applying the same reduction operator to the maximum function derives a function which returns the largest of a group of numbers
in the j language iverson substituted the terms verb for function and adverb or conjunction for operator
apl also identifies those features built into the language and represented by a symbol or a fixed combination of symbols as primitives
most primitives are either functions or operators
coding apl is largely a process of writing non primitive functions and operators
however a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators most noticeably assignment
some words used in apl literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science
apl has explicit representations of functions operators and syntax thus providing a basis for the clear and explicit statement of extended facilities in the language and tools to experiment on them
hello world a design theme in apl is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages
the hello world string constant above displays because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly
another example of this theme is that exponentiation in apl is written as which indicates raising to the power
many languages use to signify multiplication as in but apl chooses to use
however if no base is specified most programming languages one would see this as a syntax error
apl however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant e and interprets as
suppose that is an array of numbers
then gives its average
reading right to left gives the number of elements in x and since is a dyadic operator the term to its left is required as well
it is surrounded by parentheses since otherwise x would be taken and gives the sum of the elements of x
building on this the following expression computes standard deviation naturally one would define this expression as a function for repeated use rather than rewriting it each time
further since assignment is an operator it can appear within an expression so the following would place suitable values into t av and sd xx the above does a lot concisely although it may seem complex to a new
it combines the following apl functions since there is no function to the left of the left most x to tell apl what to do with the result it simply outputs it to the display without needing any explicit instruction to do that
codice also has a monadic equivalent called codice which simply returns one random integer between and its sole operand the right of it inclusive
thus a role playing game program might use the expression codice to roll a twenty sided die
the following expression finds all prime numbers from to r
in both time and space the calculation complexity is formula
rr xx
the following function life written in dyalog apl takes a boolean matrix and calculates the new generation according to conways game of life
it demonstrates the power of apl to implement a complex algorithm in very little code but understanding it requires some advanced knowledge of apl
this is emphasized text
apl derives its name from the initials of iversons book a programming language even though the book describes iversons mathematical notation rather than the implemented programming language described in this article
the name is used only for actual implementations starting with apl
apl is occasionally re interpreted as array programming language or array processing language thereby making apl into a backronym
there has always been cooperation between apl vendors and joint conferences were held on a regular basis from until
at such conferences apl merchandise was often handed out featuring apl motifs or collection of vendor logos
common were apples and the code snippet which are the symbols produced by the classic apl keyboard layout when holding the apl modifier key and typing apl
despite all these community efforts no universal vendor agnostic logo for the programming language emerged
as popular programming languages increasingly have established recognisable logos fortran getting one in british apl association launched a campaign in the second half of to establish such a logo for apl and after a community election and multiple rounds of feedback a logo was chosen in may
apl is used for many purposes including financial and insurance applications artificial intelligence neural networks and robotics
it has been argued that apl is a calculation tool and not a programming language its symbolic nature and array capabilities have made it popular with domain experts and data scientists who do not have or require the skills of a computer programmer
apl is well suited to image manipulation and computer animation where graphic transformations can be encoded as matrix multiplications
one of the first commercial computer graphics houses digital effects produced an apl graphics product named visions which was used to create television commercials and animation for the film tron
latterly the stormwind boating simulator uses apl to implement its core logic its interfacing to the rendering pipeline middleware and a major part of its physics engine
today apl remains in use in a wide range of commercial and scientific applications for example investment management asset management health care and dna profiling and by hobbyists
the first implementation of apl using recognizable apl symbols was apl which ran on the ibm system and was completed in november though at that time remained in use only within ibm
in its implementors larry breed dick lathwell and roger moore were awarded the grace murray hopper award from the association for computing machinery
it was given for their work in the design and implementation of apl setting new standards in simplicity efficiency reliability and response time for interactive systems
in the ibm microcomputer offered apl as one of two built in rom based interpreted languages for the computer complete with a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language
significant developments to apl included cms apl which made use of the virtual storage capabilities of cms and aplsv which introduced shared variables system variables and system functions
it was subsequently ported to the ibm system and vspc platforms until its final release in after which it was replaced by apl
in apl became the first publicly available apl system created by ibm for the ibm
it became the most popular ibm type iii library software that ibm released
aplplus and sharp apl are versions of apl with added business oriented extensions such as data formatting and facilities to store apl arrays in external files
they were jointly developed by two companies employing various members of the original ibm apl development team
the two companies were i
sharp associates an apl services company formed in by ian sharp roger moore and others and stsc a time sharing and consulting service company formed in by lawrence breed and others
together the two developed aplplus and thereafter continued to work together but develop apl separately as aplplus and sharp apl
stsc ported aplplus to many platforms with versions being made for the vax pc and unix whereas ipsa took a different approach to the arrival of the personal computer and made sharp apl available on this platform using additional pc xt hardware
in soliton incorporated was formed to support sharp apl and it developed sharp apl into sax
aplplus continues as apl aplwin
in ian sharp and dan dyer of stsc jointly received the kenneth e
iverson award for outstanding contribution to apl
apl was a significant re implementation of apl by ibm which was developed from and first released in
it provides many additions to the language of which the most notable is nested array support
the entire apl products and services team was awarded the iverson award in
in ibm sold apl to log on software who develop and sell the product as log on apl
in aplgol was released as an experimental version of apl that added structured programming language constructs to the language framework
new statements were added for interstatement control conditional statement execution and statement structuring as well as statements to clarify the intent of the algorithm
it was implemented for hewlett packard in
dyalog apl was first released by british company dyalog ltd
in and is available for aix linux macos and microsoft windows platforms
it is based on apl with extensions to support object oriented programming functional programming and tacit programming
licences are free for personal non commercial use
in two of the development team john scholes and peter donnelly were awarded the iverson award for their work on the interpreter
gitte christensen and morten kromberg were joint recipients of the iverson award in
nars is an open source apl interpreter written by bob smith a prominent apl developer and implementor from stsc in the s and s
nars contains advanced features and new datatypes and runs natively on microsoft windows and other platforms under wine
it is named after a development tool from the s nars
aplx is a cross platform dialect of apl based on apl and with several extensions which was first released by british company microapl in
although no longer in development or on commercial sale it is now available free of charge from dyalog
york apl was developed at the york university ontario around running on ibm mainframes
one notable difference between it and apl was that it defined the shape of a scalar as whereas apl defined it as the more mathematically correct this made it easier to write functions that acted the same with scalars and vectors
gnu apl is a free implementation of extended apl as specified in iso iec and is thus an implementation of apl
it runs on linux macos several bsd dialects and on windows
gnu apl uses unicode internally and can be scripted
it was written by jrgen sauermann
richard stallman founder of the gnu project was an early adopter of apl using it to write a text editor as a high school student in the summer of
apl is traditionally an interpreted language having language characteristics such as weak variable typing not well suited to compilation
however with arrays as its core data structure it provides opportunities for performance gains through parallelism parallel computing massively parallel applications and very large scale integration and from the outset apl has been regarded as a high performance language for example it was noted for the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations because it operates on arrays and performs operations like matrix inversion internally
most apl interpreters support idiom recognition and evaluate common idioms as single operations
for example by evaluating the idiom codice as a single operation the creation of two intermediate arrays is avoided
weak typing in apl means that a name may reference an array a function or an operator
in general the interpreter cannot know in advance which form it will be and must therefore perform analysis syntax checking etc
at run time
however in certain circumstances it is possible to deduce in advance what type a name is expected to reference and then generate bytecode which can be executed with reduced run time overhead
this bytecode can also be optimised using compilation techniques such as constant folding or common subexpression elimination
the interpreter will execute the bytecode when present and when any assumptions which have been made are met
dyalog apl includes support for optimised bytecode
compilation of apl has been the subject of research and experiment since the language first became available the first compiler is considered to be the burroughs apl which was released around
in order to be able to compile apl language limitations have to be imposed
apex is a research apl compiler which was written by robert bernecky and is available under the gnu public license
the stsc apl compiler is a hybrid of a bytecode optimiser and a compiler it enables compilation of functions to machine code provided that its sub functions and globals are declared but the interpreter is still used as a runtime library and to execute functions which do not meet the compilation requirements
apl has been standardized by the american national standards institute working group xj and international organization for standardization and international electrotechnical commission iso iec joint technical committee subcommittee working group
the core apl language is specified in iso and the extended apl language is specified in iso iec
algol is a family of imperative computer programming languages originally developed in
algol heavily influenced many other languages and was the standard method for algorithm description used by the association for computing machinery in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years
in the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is algol like it was arguably more influential than three other high level programming languages among which it was roughly contemporary fortran lisp and cobol
it was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with fortran and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages including pl i simula bcpl b pascal and c
algol introduced code blocks and the codice
codice pairs for delimiting them
it was also the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope
moreover it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the algol report introduced backus naur form a principal formal grammar notation for language design
algol is substantially different from algol and was not well received so in general algol means algol and its dialects
algol was developed jointly by a committee of european and american computer scientists in a meeting in at the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich
it specified three different syntaxes a reference syntax a publication syntax and an implementation syntax
the different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points for different languages
algol was used mostly by research computer scientists in the united states and in europe
its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than burroughs corporation
algol did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development
john backus developed the backus normal form method of describing programming languages specifically for algol
it was revised and expanded by peter naur for algol and at donald knuths suggestion renamed backus naur form
peter naur as editor of the algol bulletin i was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the european language design group in november
in this capacity i was the editor of the algol report produced as the result of the algol meeting in paris in january
alan perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting the meetings were exhausting interminable and exhilarating
one became aggravated when ones good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others
nevertheless diligence persisted during the entire period
the chemistry of the was excellent
algol inspired many languages that followed it
tony hoare remarked here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors
the scheme programming language a variant of lisp that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of algol also adopted the wording revised report on the algorithmic language scheme for its standards documents in homage to algol
as peter landin noted algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the lambda calculus
perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to john c
reynolds and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity
reynoldss idealized algol also made a convincing methodologic argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call by name languages in contrast with the global effects used by call by value languages such as ml
the conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research along with programming computable functions and ml
to date there have been at least augmentations extensions derivations and sublanguages of algol
the burroughs dialects included special bootstrapping dialects such as espol and newp
the latter is still used for unisys mcp system software
algol as officially defined had no i o facilities implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other
in contrast algol offered an extensive library of transput facilities
algol allowed for two evaluation strategies for parameter passing the common call by value and call by name
call by name has certain effects in contrast to call by reference
for example without specifying the parameters as value or reference it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable
think of passing a pointer to swap
a similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument
call by name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting thunks that are used to implement it
donald knuth devised the man or boy test to separate compilers that correctly implemented recursion and non local references
this test contains an example of call by name
algol was defined using a two level grammar formalism invented by adriaan van wijngaarden and which bears his name
van wijngaarden grammars use a context free grammar to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular algol program notably they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled semantics and have to be expressed in ambiguity prone natural language prose and then implemented in compilers as ad hoc code attached to the formal language parser
here is an example of how to produce a table using elliott algol
punch sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch
sameline suppresses the carriage return line feed normally printed between arguments
aligned controls the format of the output with digit before and after the decimal point
the following code samples are algol versions of the above algol code samples
algol implementations used algol s approaches to stropping
in algol s case tokens with the bold typeface are reserved words types or operators
note lower and upper bounds of an array and array slicing are directly available to the programmer
the variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic hello world program
algol had no i o facilities
since algol had no i o facilities there is no portable hello world program in algol
the next three examples are in burroughs extended algol
the first two direct output at the interactive terminal they are run on
the first uses a character array similar to c
the language allows the array identifier to be used as a pointer to the array and hence in a replace statement
an even simpler program using the display statement
note that its output would end up at the system console an alternative example using elliott algol i o is as follows
elliott algol used different characters for open string quote and close string quote represented here by and
below is a version from elliott algol
the standard elliott used five hole paper tape and thus only had upper case
the code lacked any quote characters so was used for open quote and for close quote
special sequences were placed in double quotes
the ict series algol i o version allowed input from paper tape or punched card
paper tape full mode allowed lower case
output was to a line printer
the open and close quote characters were represented using and spaces by
algol code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase but bolded or underlined
in the language of the algol report the input output facilities were collectively called the transput
the algols were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly also the algols were defined so that only uppercase letters were required
ifip the algol language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems but unfortunately were unsupported on most computing systems at the time
for instance and
september ascii the ascii character set then in an early stage of development had the character added to it in order to support algols boolean operators and
alcor this character set included the unusual runic cross character for multiplication and the decimal exponent symbol for floating point notation
gost the soviet standard gost allowed the encoding of bit bit bit and bit characters in algol
the algol report used extant algol characters and further adopted and characters which can be found on the ibm keyboard with typeball print heads inserted
these became available in the mid s while algol was being drafted
the report was translated into russian german french and bulgarian and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets eg cyrillic alphabet of the soviet besm
all algols characters are also part of the unicode standard and most of them are available in several popular fonts
october unicode the codice for floating point notation was added to unicode for backward compatibility with historic buran programme algol software
awk is a domain specific language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool
like sed and grep it is a filter and is a standard feature of most unix like operating systems
the awk language is a data driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline for purposes of extracting or transforming text such as producing formatted reports
the language extensively uses the string datatype associative arrays and regular expressions
while awk has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one liner programs the language is turing complete and even the early bell labs users of awk often wrote well structured large awk programs
awk was created at bell labs in the s and its name is derived from the surnames of its authors alfred aho peter weinberger and brian kernighan
the acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird species auk which is illustrated on the cover of the awk programming language
when written in all lowercase letters as codice it refers to the unix or plan program that runs scripts written in the awk programming language
awk was initially developed in by alfred aho peter j
weinberger and brian kernighan
awk takes its name from their respective initials
according to kernighan one of the goals of awk was to have a tool that would easily manipulate both numbers and strings
awk was also inspired by marc rochkinds programming language that was used to search for patterns in input data and was implemented using yacc
as one of the early tools to appear in version unix awk added computational features to a unix pipeline besides the bourne shell the only scripting language available in a standard unix environment
it is one of the mandatory utilities of the single unix specification and is required by the linux standard base specification
awk was significantly revised and expanded in resulting in the gnu awk implementation written by paul rubin jay fenlason and richard stallman released in
gnu awk may be the most widely deployed version because it is included with gnu based linux packages
gnu awk has been maintained solely by arnold robbins since
brian kernighans nawk source was first released in unpublicized and publicly since the late s many bsd systems use it to avoid the gpl license
awk was preceded by sed
both were designed for text processing
they share the line oriented data driven paradigm and are particularly suited to writing one liner programs due to the implicit main loop and current line variables
the power and terseness of early awk programs notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables which facilitate one liners together with the limitations of awk at the time were important inspirations for the perl language
in the s perl became very popular competing with awk in the niche of unix text processing languages
where condition is typically an expression and action is a series of commands
the input is split into records where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines
the program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn and executes the action for each expression that is true
either the condition or the action may be omitted
the condition defaults to matching every record
the default action is to print the record
this is the same pattern action structure as sed
in addition to a simple awk expression such as codice or codice the condition can be codice or codice causing the action to be executed before or after all records have been read or pattern pattern which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches pattern up to and including the record that matches pattern before again trying to match against pattern on subsequent lines
in addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators awk expressions include the tilde operator codice which matches a regular expression against a string
as handy syntactic sugar regexp without using the tilde operator matches against the current record this syntax derives from sed which in turn inherited it from the ed editor where codice is used for searching
this syntax of using slashes as delimiters for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by perl and ecmascript and is now common
the tilde operator was also adopted by perl
awk commands are the statements that are substituted for action in the examples above
awk commands can include function calls variable assignments calculations or any combination thereof
awk contains built in support for many functions many more are provided by the various flavors of awk
also some flavors support the inclusion of dynamically linked libraries which can also provide more functions
the print command is used to output text
the output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator whose default value is a newline
the simplest form of this command is although these fields may bear resemblance to variables they actually refer to the fields of the current record
a special case refers to the entire record
in fact the commands codice and codice are identical in functionality
regexpattern regexpattern regexpattern awks built in variables include the field variables and so on
they hold the text or values in the individual text fields in a record
variable names can use any of the characters with the exception of language keywords
the operators represent addition subtraction multiplication and division respectively
for string concatenation simply place two variables next to each other
it is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between
double quotes delimit string constants
statements need not end with semicolons
finally comments can be added to programs by using as the first character on a line
in a format similar to c function definitions consist of the keyword codice the function name argument names and the function body
here is an example of a function
function addthree functions can have variables that are in the local scope
the names of these are added to the end of the argument list though values for these should be omitted when calling the function
it is convention to add some whitespace in the argument list before the local variables to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin
begin print all lines longer than characters
note that the default action is to print the current line
length as there is no pattern for the first line of the program every line of input matches by default so the increment actions are executed for every line
note that codice is shorthand for codice
s is incremented by the numeric value of nf which is the last word on the line as defined by awks field separator
nf is the number of fields in the current line eg
since is the value of the fourth field nf is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines
is actually a unary operator with the highest operator precedence
at the end of the input the end pattern matches so s is printed
however since there may have been no lines of input at all in which case no value has ever been assigned to s it will by default be an empty string
adding zero to a variable is an awk idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value
with the coercion the program prints on an empty input without it an empty line is printed
the action statement prints each line numbered
the printf function emulates the standard c printf and works similarly to the print command described above
the pattern to match however works as follows nr is the number of records typically lines of input awk has so far read ie the current line number starting at for the first line of input
is the modulo operator
nr is true for the st th th etc
lines of input
likewise nr is true for the rd th th etc
lines of input
the range pattern is false until the first part matches on line and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches on line
it then stays false until the first part matches again on line
thus the program prints lines skips line and then and so on
for each line it prints the line number and then the line contents
for example when executed on this input as a special case when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true eg the range will start at the beginning of the input
similarly if the second part is constantly false eg the range will continue until the end of input
for example prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression cut here that is a line containing only the phrase cut here to the end
begin end the begin block sets the field separator to any sequence of non alphabetic characters
note that separators can be regular expressions
after that we get to a bare action which performs the action on every input line
in this case for every field on the line we add one to the number of times that word first converted to lowercase appears
finally in the end block we print the words with their frequencies
the line creates a loop that goes through the array words setting i to each subscript of the array
this is different from most languages where such a loop goes through each value in the array
the loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count
codice was an addition to the one true awk made after the book was published
this program can be represented in several ways
the first one uses the bourne shell to make a shell script that does everything
it is the shortest of these methods pattern shift awk pattern print filename the codice in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces
a pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line matches
codice contains the current filename
awk has no explicit concatenation operator two adjacent strings concatenate them
codice expands to the original unchanged input line
there are alternate ways of writing this
this shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk export pattern shift awk environpattern print filename this is a shell script that uses codice an array introduced in a newer version of the one true awk after the book was published
the subscript of codice is the name of an environment variable its result is the variables value
this is like the getenv function in various standard libraries and posix
the shell script makes an environment variable codice containing the first argument then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file
codice checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand codice is its inverse
note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables
pattern shift awk pattern print filename patternpattern or you can use the v varvalue command line option
begin the codice is necessary not only to extract the first argument but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codice block ends
codice the number of arguments is always guaranteed to be as codice
also note that codice is the empty string codice
codice initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line
note the codice block
awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command
this means that only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codice is run if you explicitly set codice to so that there are no arguments awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files
therefore you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename codice
on unix like operating systems self contained awk scripts can be constructed using the shebang syntax
it can be invoked with codice the codice tells awk that the argument that follows is the file to read the awk program from which is the same flag that is used in sed
since they are often used for one liners both these programs default to executing a program given as a command line argument rather than a separate file
awk was originally written in and distributed with version unix
in its authors started expanding the language most significantly by adding user defined functions
the language is described in the book the awk programming language published and its implementation was made available in releases of unix system v
to avoid confusion with the incompatible older version this version was sometimes called new awk or nawk
this implementation was released under a free software license in and is still maintained by brian kernighan
old versions of unix such as unix v included codice which converted awk to c
kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into c its state is not known
in nordic mythology asgard is a location associated with the gods
it appears in a multitude of old norse sagas and mythological texts
it is described as the fortified home of the sir gods often associated with gold imagery
many of the best known nordic gods are sir or live in asgard such as odin thor loki and baldr
the word sgarr is a compound formed from and
possible anglicisations include sgarthr sgard segard sgardr asgardr sgarth asgarth esageard and sgardhr
asgard is named twice in eddic poetry
the first case is in hymiskvia when thor and tr journey from asgard to hymirs hall to obtain a cauldron large enough to brew beer for a feast for gir and the gods
the second instance is in rymskvia when loki is attempting to convince thor to dress up as freyja in order to get back mjlnir by claiming that without his hammer to protect them jtnar would soon be living in asgard
grmnisml contains among its cosmological descriptions a number of abodes of the gods such as lfheim natn and valhall which some scholars have identified as being in asgard
it is to be noted however that asgard is not mentioned at any point in the poem
furthermore vlusp references iavllr one of the most common meeting places of sir gods which in gylfaginning snorri locates in the centre of asgard
the prose eddas euhemeristic prologue portrays the sir gods as people that travelled from the east to northern territories
according to snorri asgard represented the town of troy before greek warriors overtook it
after the defeat trojans moved to northern europe where they became a dominant group due to their advanced technologies and culture
eventually other tribes began to perceive the trojans and their leader trr as gods
in gylfaginning snorri sturluson describes how during the creation of the world the gods made the earth and surrounded it with the sea
they made the sky from the skull of ymir and settled the on the shores of the earth
they set down the brows of ymir forming midgard and in the centre of the world they built asgard which he identifies as troy after asgard is made the gods then built a hof named glasheimr at iavllr in the centre of the burg with a high seat for odin and twelve seats for other gods
it is described as like gold both on the inside and the outside and as the best of all buildings in the world
they also built vinglf for the female gods which is described as both a hall and a hrgr and a forge with which they crafted objects from gold
after ragnark some gods such as vli and baldr will meet at iavllr where asgard once stood and discuss matters together
there they will also find in the grass the golden chess pieces that the sir had once owned
later the section describes how an unnamed jtunn came to the gods with his stallion svailfari and offered help in building a burg for the gods in three winters asking in return for the sun moon and marriage with freyja
despite freyjas opposition together the gods agree to fulfill his request if he completes his work in just one winter
as time goes on the gods grow desperate as it becomes apparent that the jtunn will construct the burg on time
to their surprise his stallion contributes much of the progress swiftly moving boulders and rocks
to deal with the problem loki comes up with a plan whereupon he changes his appearance to that of a mare and distracts svailfari to slow down construction
without the help of his stallion the builder realises he cannot complete his task in time and goes into a rage revealing his identity as a jtunn
thor then kills the builder with mjllnir before any harm to the gods is done
the chapter does not explicitly name asgard as the fortress but they are commonly identified by scholars
in gylfaginning the central cosmic tree yggdrasil is described as having three roots that hold it up one of these goes to the sir which has been interpreted as meaning asgard
in grmnisml this root instead reaches over the realm of men
the bridge bifrst is told to span from the heavens to the earth and over it the sir cross each day to hold council beneath yggdrasil at the urarbrunnr
based on this bifrst is commonly interpreted as the bridge to asgard
asgard is mentioned briefly throughout skldskaparml as the name for the home of the sir as in gylfaginning
in this section a number of locations are described as lying within asgard including valhalla and in front of its doors the golden grove glasir
it also records a name for thor as defender of sgard
in the ynglinga saga found in heimskringla snorri describes asgard as a city in asia based on a perceived but erroneous connection between the words for asia and sir
odin then leaves to settle in the northern part of the world and leaves his brothers vili and v to rule over the city
when the euhemerised odin dies the account states that the swedes believed he had returned to asgard and would live there forever
cosmology in old nordic religion is presented in a vague and often contradictory manner when viewed from a naturalistic standpoint
snorri places asgard in the centre of the world surrounded by midgard and then the lands inhabited by all of which are finally encircled by the sea
he also locates the homes of the gods in the heavens
this had led to the proposition of a system of concentric circles centred on asgard or yggdrasil and sometimes with a vertical axis leading upwards towards the heavens
there is debate between scholars over whether the gods were conceived of as living in the heavens with some aligning their views with snorri and others proposing that he at times presents the system in a christian framework and that this organisation is not seen in either eddic or skaldic poetry
the concept of attempting to create a spatial cosmological model has itself been criticised by scholars who argue that the oral traditions did not form a naturalistic structured system that aimed to be internally geographically consistent
an alternative proposal is that the world should be conceived of as a number of realms connected by passages that cannot be typically traversed
this would explain how asgard can be located both to the east and west of the realm of men over the sea and over bifrst
it has been noted that the tendency to link asgard to troy is part of a wider european cultural practice of claiming trojan origins for ones culture first seen in the aeneid and also featuring in geoffrey of monmouths historia regum britanniae for the founding of britain
thor first appeared in the marvel universe within comic series journey into mystery in the issues during august
following this release he becomes one of the central figures in the comics along with loki and odin
in the marvel cinematic universe thor and loki make their first appearance together in the film thor
after that thor becomes a regular character in the marvel cinematic universe and reappears in several films including the avengers series
asgard becomes the central element of the film where it is destroyed following the old norse mythos
these and other norse mythology elements also appear in video games tv series and books based in and on the marvel universe although these depictions do not closely follow historical sources
asgard is an explorable realm in the video game god of war ragnark a sequel to s norse themed god of war
in the assassins creed valhalla video game asgard is featured as part of a vision quest
the apollo program also known as project apollo was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration which succeeded in preparing and landing the first humans on the moon from to
it was first conceived in during president dwight d
eisenhowers administration as a three person spacecraft to follow the one person project mercury which put the first americans in space
apollo was later dedicated to president john f
kennedys national goal for the s of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth in an address to congress on may
it was the third us human spaceflight program to fly preceded by the two person project gemini conceived in to extend spaceflight capability in support of apollo
kennedys goal was accomplished on the apollo mission when astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their apollo lunar module on july and walked on the lunar surface while michael collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module and all three landed safely on earth in the pacific ocean on july
five subsequent apollo missions also landed astronauts on the moon the last apollo in december
in these six spaceflights twelve people walked on the moon
apollo ran from to with the first crewed flight in
it encountered a major setback in when an apollo cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test
after the first successful landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration
budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these
five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the apollo landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the moon crippling the csm
the crew barely returned to earth safely by using the lunar module as a lifeboat on the return journey
apollo used the saturn family of rockets as launch vehicles which were also used for an apollo applications program which consisted of skylab a space station that supported three crewed missions in and the apollo soyuz test project a joint united states soviet union low earth orbit mission in
apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones
it stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond low earth orbit
apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body and apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one
overall the apollo program returned of lunar rocks and soil to earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the moons composition and geological history
the program laid the foundation for nasas subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its johnson space center and kennedy space center
apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early as a follow up to project mercury
while the mercury capsule could support only one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission apollo would carry three
possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station circumlunar flights and eventual crewed lunar landings
the program was named after apollo the greek god of light music and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein who later said i was naming the spacecraft like id name my baby
silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in because he felt apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program
in july nasa deputy administrator hugh l
dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences
preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a mission module cabin separate from the command module and a propulsion and equipment module
on august a feasibility study competition was announced and on october three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics convair general electric and the glenn l
martin company
meanwhile nasa performed its own in house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs
in november john f
kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense
up to the election of kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had developed between the soviet union and the united states due to the inaction of president eisenhower
beyond military power kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige pledging to make the us not first but first and first if but first period
despite kennedys rhetoric he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the apollo program once he became president
he knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a crewed moon landing
when kennedys newly appointed nasa administrator james e
webb requested a percent budget increase for his agency kennedy supported an acceleration of nasas large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue
on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union
at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarins flight many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up
kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news refusing to make a commitment on americas response to the soviets
on april kennedy sent a memo to vice president lyndon b
johnson asking johnson to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up
johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership
his memo concluded that a crewed moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first
at the time of kennedys proposal only one american had flown in space less than a month earlier and nasa had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit
even some nasa employees doubted whether kennedys ambitious goal could be met
by kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint us ussr moon mission to eliminate duplication of effort
with the clear goal of a crewed landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and circumlunar flights nasa decided that in order to make progress quickly it would discard the feasibility study designs of convair ge and martin and proceed with fagets command and service module design
the mission module was determined to be useful only as an extra room and therefore unnecessary
they used fagets design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in october
on november it was announced that north american aviation had won the contract although its bid was not rated as good as the martin proposal
webb dryden and robert seamans chose it in preference due to north americans longer association with nasa and its predecessor
landing humans on the moon by the end of required the most sudden burst of technological creativity and the largest commitment of resources ever made by any nation in peacetime
at its peak the apollo program employed people and required the support of over industrial firms and universities
on july nasa established the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama
msfc designed the heavy lift class saturn launch vehicles which would be required for apollo
it became clear that managing the apollo program would exceed the capabilities of robert r
gilruths space task group which had been directing the nations crewed space program from nasas langley research center
so gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new nasa center the manned spacecraft center
a site was chosen in houston texas on land donated by rice university and administrator webb announced the conversion on september
it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida so a new mission control center would be included in the msc
the msc was completed in september
it was renamed by the us congress in honor of lyndon johnson soon after his death in
it also became clear that apollo would outgrow the canaveral launch facilities in florida
the two newest launch complexes were already being built for the saturn i and ib rockets at the northernmost end lc and lc
but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the crewed lunar mission so land acquisition was started in july for a launch operations center immediately north of canaveral at merritt island
the design development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h
debus a member of wernher von brauns original v rocket engineering team
debus was named the locs first director
construction began in november
following kennedys death president johnson issued an executive order on november to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy
the loc included launch complex a launch control center and a vertical assembly building
in which the space vehicle would be assembled on a mobile launcher platform and then moved by a crawler transporter to one of several launch pads
although at least three pads were planned only two designated aandb were completed in october
the loc also included an operations and checkout building to which gemini and apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles
the apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to which is nearly a vacuum
administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization so he recruited george e
mueller for a high management job
mueller accepted on the condition that he have a say in nasa reorganization necessary to effectively administer apollo
webb then worked with associate administrator seamans to reorganize the office of manned space flight
on july webb announced muellers appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight to replace then associate administrator d
brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september
under webbs reorganization the directors of the manned spacecraft center marshall space flight center and the launch operations center reported to mueller
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high ranking officers in the us air force so he got webbs permission to recruit general samuel c
phillips who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program as omsf program controller
phillipss superior officer bernard a
schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa along with a staff of officers under him on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director
mueller agreed and phillips managed apollo from january until it achieved the first human landing in july after which he returned to air force duty
charles fishman author of one giant leap book estimated the number of people and organizations involved into the apollo program as men and women at some different companies contributed to the effort
once kennedy had defined a goal the apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life cost and demands on technology and astronaut skill
four possible mission modes were considered in early direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa
many engineers feared that rendezvous and docking maneuvers that had not been attempted in earth orbit would be nearly impossible in lunar orbit
lor advocates including john houbolt at langley research center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the lor approach
throughout and houbolt campaigned for the recognition of lor as a viable and practical option
bypassing the nasa hierarchy he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question
seamanss establishment of an ad hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e
golovin in july to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program represented a turning point in nasas mission mode decision
this committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice and recommended in favor of a hybrid eor lor mode
its consideration of lor as well as houbolts ceaseless work played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach
in late and early members of the manned spacecraft center began to come around to support lor including the newly hired deputy director of the office of manned space flight joseph shea who became a champion of lor
the engineers at marshall space flight center which had much to lose from the decision took longer to become convinced of its merits but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing on june
but even after nasa reached internal agreement it was far from smooth sailing
kennedys science advisor jerome wiesner who had expressed his opposition to human spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office and had opposed the decision to land people on the moon hired golovin who had left nasa to chair his own space vehicle panel ostensibly to monitor but actually to second guess nasas decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea seamans and even webb to defend themselves delaying its formal announcement to the press on july and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as tentative
wiesner kept up the pressure even making the disagreement public during a two day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center
wiesner blurted out no thats no good in front of the press during a presentation by von braun
webb jumped in and defended von braun until kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was still subject to final review
webb held firm and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module contractors
wiesner finally relented unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in kennedys office because of the presidents involvement with the october cuban missile crisis and fear of kennedys support for webb
nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship
some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen
in an msc study concluded the lm lifeboat
was finally dropped because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps
ironically just such a failure happened on apollo when an oxygen tank explosion left the csm without electrical power
the lunar module provided propulsion electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely
fagets preliminary apollo design employed a cone shaped command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power sized appropriately for the space station cislunar and lunar landing missions
once kennedys moon landing goal became official detailed design began of a command and service module in which the crew would spend the entire direct ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip after being soft landed by a larger landing propulsion module
the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csms role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew along with a new spacecraft the lunar excursion module but still pronounced which would take two individuals to the lunar surface and return them to the csm
the command module was the conical crew cabin designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing
it was the only component of the apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early apollo study designs
its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield and had its own reaction control system engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path
parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown
the module was tall in diameter and weighed approximately
a cylindrical service module supported the command module with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants
a high gain s band antenna was used for long distance communications on the lunar flights
on the extended lunar missions an orbital scientific instrument package was carried
the service module was discarded just before reentry
the module was long and in diameter
the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately fully fueled while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa
because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off the moon and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight
also there was no provision for docking with the lunar module
a program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing while block ii the actual lunar spacecraft would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development
the apollo lunar module was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module
not designed to fly through the earths atmosphere or return to earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction
it consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine
the descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment
the ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system
the initial lm model weighed approximately and allowed surface stays up to around hours
an extended lunar module weighed over and allowed surface stays of more than three days
the contract for design and construction of the lunar module was awarded to grumman aircraft engineering corporation and the project was overseen by thomas j
before the apollo program began wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles the saturn series and the even larger nova series
in the midst of these plans von braun was transferred from the army to nasa and was made director of the marshall space flight center
the initial direct ascent plan to send the three person apollo command and service module directly to the lunar surface on top of a large descent rocket stage would require a nova class launcher with a lunar payload capability of over
the june decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo
since apollo like mercury used more than one launch vehicle for space missions nasa used spacecraft launch vehicle combination series numbers as x for saturn i as x for saturn ib and as x for saturn v to designate and plan all missions rather than numbering them sequentially as in project gemini
this was changed by the time human flights began
since apollo like mercury would require a launch escape system in case of a launch failure a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system
a rocket bigger than the little joe used by mercury would be required so the little joe ii was built by general dynamics convair
after an august qualification test flight four les test flights were made at the white sands missile range between may and january
saturn i the first us heavy lift launch vehicle was initially planned to launch partially equipped csms in low earth orbit tests
the s i first stage burned rp with liquid oxygen oxidizer in eight clustered rocketdyne h engines to produce of thrust
the s iv second stage used six liquid hydrogen fueled pratt whitney rl engines with of thrust
the s v third stage flew inactively on saturn i four times
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc with only the first stage live carrying dummy upper stages filled with water
the first flight with a live s iv was launched from lc
this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms into orbit in and
the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts
in september nasa planned to launch four crewed csm flights on the saturn i from late through concurrent with project gemini
the payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included so the decision was made in october to use the uprated saturn ib for all crewed earth orbital flights
the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i
the s ib first stage increased the thrust to by uprating the h engine
the second stage replaced the s iv with the s ivb powered by a single j engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox to produce of thrust
a restartable version of the s ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v
the saturn ib could send over into low earth orbit sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm
saturn ib launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as series number as indicating apollo saturn and the indicating the second member of the saturn rocket family
saturn v launch vehicles and flights were designated with an as series number as indicating apollo saturn and the indicating saturn v
the three stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon
it was in diameter and stood tall with its lunar payload
its capability grew to for the later advanced lunar landings
the s ic first stage burned rp lox for a rated thrust of which was upgraded to
the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen the third stage was a modified version of the s ivb with thrust increased to and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit
nasas director of flight crew operations during the apollo program was donald k
deke slayton one of the original mercury seven astronauts who was medically grounded in september due to a heart murmur
slayton was responsible for making all gemini and apollo crew assignments
thirty two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the apollo program
twenty four of these left earths orbit and flew around the moon between december and december
half of the walked on the moons surface though none of them returned to it after landing once
one of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist
of the gus grissom ed white and roger chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the apollo mission
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans plus from two later astronaut groups
all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans
crews on all development flights through the first two landings on apollo and apollo included at least two gemini veterans
harrison schmitt a geologist was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space and landed on the moon on the last mission apollo
schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the apollo landing crews
nasa awarded all of these astronauts its highest honor the distinguished service medal given for distinguished service ability or courage and personal contribution representing substantial progress to the nasa mission
the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom white and chaffee in then to the crews of all missions from apollo onward
the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo walter m
schirra donn eisele and walter cunningham were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal because of discipline problems with the flight directors orders during their flight
in october the nasa administrator decided to award them the distinguished service medals
for schirra and eisele this was posthumously
two block i csms were launched from lc on suborbital flights in with the saturn ib
the first as launched on february reached an altitude of and splashed down downrange in the atlantic ocean
the second as on august reached altitude and was recovered downrange in the pacific ocean
these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield
a third saturn ib test as launched from pad went into orbit to support design of the s ivb upper stage restart capability needed for the saturn v
it carried a nose cone instead of the apollo spacecraft and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors and a tv camera
this flight occurred on july before as which was delayed because of problems getting the apollo spacecraft ready for flight
two crewed orbital block i csm missions were planned as and as
the block i crew positions were titled command pilot senior pilot and pilot
the senior pilot would assume navigation duties while the pilot would function as a systems engineer
the astronauts would wear a modified version of the gemini spacesuit
after an uncrewed lm test flight as a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as or as
the block ii crew positions were titled commander command module pilot and lunar module pilot
the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo al spacesuit designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity
the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear fishbowl type for greater visibility and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water cooled undergarment
deke slayton the grounded mercury astronaut who became director of flight crew operations for the gemini and apollo programs selected the first apollo crew in january with grissom as command pilot white as senior pilot and rookie donn f
eisele as pilot
but eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the kc weightlessness training aircraft and had to undergo surgery on january
slayton replaced him with chaffee
nasa announced the final crew selection for as on march with the backup crew consisting of gemini veterans james mcdivitt and david scott with rookie russell l
rusty schweickart
mercury gemini veteran wally schirra eisele and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september as the prime crew for as
in december the as mission was canceled since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the day first flight and as would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft
its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission now redesignated as or as planned for august
mcdivitt scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as crew and schirra eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo backup crew
the spacecraft for the as and as missions were delivered by north american aviation to the kennedy space center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight these delays caused the launch of as to slip behind as and eliminated hopes the first crewed mission might be ready to launch as soon as november concurrently with the last gemini mission
eventually the planned as flight date was pushed to february
north american aviation was prime contractor not only for the apollo csm but for the saturnv s ii second stage as well and delays in this stage pushed the first uncrewed saturnv flight as from late to november
the problems with north american were severe enough in late to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a tiger team to investigate north americans problems and identify corrections
phillips documented his findings in a december letter to naa president lee atwood with a strongly worded letter by mueller and also gave a presentation of the results to mueller and deputy administrator robert seamans
meanwhile grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module eliminating hopes it would be ready for crewed flight in not long after the first crewed csm flights
grissom white and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo as a motivational focus on the first crewed flight
they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center
a plugs out test was planned for january which would simulate a launch countdown on lc with the spacecraft transferring from pad supplied to internal power
if successful this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the february launch with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled
the plugs out test began on the morning of january and immediately was plagued with problems
first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch
then communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown
during this hold an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure oxygen atmosphere
pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew
the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened
nasa immediately convened an accident review board overseen by both houses of congress
while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in command module design workmanship and quality control
at the insistence of nasa administrator webb north american removed harrison storms as command module program manager
webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office manager joseph francis shea replacing him with george low
to remedy the causes of the fire changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures the most important of which were use of a nitrogen oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials
the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug type hatch cover with a quick release outward opening door
nasa discontinued the crewed block i program using the blocki spacecraft only for uncrewed saturnv flights
crew members would also exclusively wear modified fire resistant al block ii space suits and would be designated by the block ii titles regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not
on april mueller published an official apollo mission numbering scheme using sequential numbers for all flights crewed or uncrewed
the sequence would start with apollo to cover the first three uncrewed flights while retiring the apollo designation to honor the crew per their widows wishes
in september mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the crewed lunar landing
each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary therefore letters were used instead of numbers
the a missions were uncrewed saturn v validation b was uncrewed lm validation using the saturn ib c was crewed csm earth orbit validation using the saturn ib d was the first crewed csm lm flight e would be a higher earth orbit csm lm flight f would be the first lunar mission testing the lm in lunar orbit but without landing and g would be the first crewed landing
the list of types covered follow on lunar exploration to include h lunar landings i for lunar orbital survey missions and j for extended stay lunar landings
the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on human rating the lm and saturnv
apollo was the first uncrewed flight of the saturnv carrying a blocki csm on november
the capability of the command modules heat shield to survive a trans lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth orbital reentry speed
apollo was the first uncrewed test flight of the lm in earth orbit launched from pad on january by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo
the lm engines were successfully test fired and restarted despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing
the ascent engine was fired in abort mode known as a fire in the hole test where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage
although grumman wanted a second uncrewed test george low decided the next lm flight would be crewed
this was followed on april by apollo which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast
the intent of this mission was to achieve trans lunar injection followed closely by a simulated direct return abort using the service module engine to achieve another high speed reentry
the saturn v experienced pogo oscillation a problem caused by non steady engine combustion which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages
two s ii engines shut down prematurely but the remaining engines were able to compensate
the damage to the third stage engine was more severe preventing it from restarting for trans lunar injection
mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of apollo
based on the good performance of apollo and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo problems nasa declared the saturnv ready to fly crew canceling a third uncrewed test
apollo launched from lc on october was the cmission crewed by schirra eisele and cunningham
it was an day earth orbital flight which tested the csm systems
apollo was planned to be the d mission in december crewed by mcdivitt scott and schweickart launched on a saturnv instead of two saturn ibs
in the summer it had become clear that the lm would not be ready in time
rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth orbiting mission aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo to orbit the moon instead deferring the dmission to the next mission in march and eliminating the e mission
this would keep the program on track
the soviet union had sent two tortoises mealworms wine flies and other lifeforms around the moon on september aboard zond and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts
the decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of apollo
gemini veterans frank borman and jim lovell and rookie william anders captured the worlds attention by making ten lunar orbits in hours transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve and returning safely to earth
the following march lm flight rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in earth orbit on apollo and schweickart tested the full lunar eva suit with its portable life support system outside the lm
the f mission was successfully carried out on apollo in may by gemini veterans thomas p
stafford john young and eugene cernan
stafford and cernan took the lm to within of the lunar surface
the g mission was achieved on apollo in july by an all gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong michael collins and buzz aldrin
armstrong and aldrin performed the first landing at the sea of tranquility at utc on july
they spent a total of hours minutes on the surface and spent hours minutes outside the spacecraft walking on the surface taking photographs collecting material samples and deploying automated scientific instruments while continuously sending black and white television back to earth
the astronauts returned safely on july
conrad and rookie alan l
bean made a precision landing of apollo within walking distance of the surveyor uncrewed lunar probe which had landed in april on the ocean of storms
the command module pilot was gemini veteran richard f
gordon jr conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun
they made two evas totaling hours and minutes
on one they walked to the surveyor photographed it and removed some parts which they returned to earth
the contracted batch of saturn vs was enough for lunar landing missions through apollo
shortly after apollo nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites after apollo with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions along with the payload capacity of the saturn v
these final missions would combine the i and j types in the list allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days
these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm
also the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander with two rookies
apollo launched lovell jack swigert and fred haise in april headed for the fra mauro formation
but two days out a liquid oxygen tank exploded disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a lifeboat to return to earth
another nasa review board was convened to determine the cause which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications
apollo was grounded again for the remainder of while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added
about the time of the first landing in it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre built on the ground replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches this eliminated apollo
nasas yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle
by the decision was made to also cancel missions and
the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f
kennedy space center on merritt island florida george c
marshall space center in huntsville alabama michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana and lyndon b
johnson space center in houston texas
the cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions
apollo had been planned to be the last of the h series missions but since there would be only two subsequent missions left it was changed to the first of three j missions
apollo s fra mauro mission was reassigned to apollo commanded in february by mercury veteran alan shepard with stuart roosa and edgar mitchell
this time the mission was successful
shepard and mitchell spent hours and minutes on the surface and completed two evas totalling hours minutes which was a record for the longest eva by a lunar crew at the time
in august just after conclusion of the apollo mission president richard nixon proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions apollo and
office of management and budget deputy director caspar weinberger was opposed to this and persuaded nixon to keep the remaining missions
apollo was launched on july with david scott alfred worden and james irwin
scott and irwin landed on july near hadley rille and spent just under two days hours on the surface
in over hours of eva they collected about of lunar material
apollo landed in the descartes highlands on april
the crew was commanded by john young with ken mattingly and charles duke
young and duke spent just under three days on the surface with a total of over hours eva
apollo was the last of the apollo program landing in the taurus littrow region in december
eugene cernan commanded ronald e
evans and nasas first scientist astronaut geologist harrison h
schmitt was originally scheduled for apollo but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing
cernan and schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over hours of total eva
several missions were planned for but were canceled before details were finalized
source apollo by the numbers a statistical reference the apollo program returned over of lunar rocks and soil to the lunar receiving laboratory in houston
today of the samples are stored at the lunar sample laboratory facility built in
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth as measured by radiometric dating techniques
they range in age from about billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria to about billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust
as such they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the solar system that are largely absent on earth
one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo mission
this anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium rich feldspar mineral anorthite and is believed to be representative of the highland crust
a geochemical component called kreep was discovered by apollo which has no known terrestrial counterpart
kreep and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the moon was once completely molten
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects
many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters which is never seen on earth rocks due to the thick atmosphere
many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events
some of the returned samples are of impact melt all samples returned from the moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events
from analyses of the composition of the returned lunar samples it is now believed that the moon was created through the impact of a large astronomical body with earth
apollo cost billion
of this amount billion was spent on the design development and production of the saturn family of launch vehicles the apollo spacecraft spacesuits scientific experiments and mission operations
the cost of constructing and operating apollo related ground facilities such as the nasa human spaceflight centers and the global tracking and data acquisition network added an additional billion
the amount grows to billion if the costs for related projects such as project gemini and the robotic ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter programs are included
accurate estimates of human spaceflight costs were difficult in the early s as the capability was new and management experience was lacking
preliminary cost analysis by nasa estimated billion billion for a crewed lunar landing effort
nasa administrator james webb increased this estimate to billion before reporting it to vice president johnson in april
project apollo was a massive undertaking representing the largest research and development project in peacetime
at its peak it employed over employees and contractors around the country and accounted for more than half of nasas total spending in the s
after the first moon landing public and political interest waned including that of president nixon who wanted to rein in federal spending
nasas budget could not sustain apollo missions which cost on average million each while simultaneously developing the space shuttle
the final fiscal year of apollo funding was
looking beyond the crewed lunar landings nasa investigated several post lunar applications for apollo hardware
the apollo extension series proposed up to flights to earth orbit using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter to house a small orbital laboratory
astronauts would continue to use the csm as a ferry to the station
this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s ivb saturn upper stage and grew into the apollo applications program
the workshop was to be supplemented by the apollo telescope mount which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack
the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly by mission
the s ivb orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board
dubbed skylab it was assembled on the ground rather than in space and launched in using the two lower stages of a saturn v
it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount
skylabs last crew departed the station on february and the station itself re entered the atmosphere in after development of the space shuttle was delayed too long to save it
the apollo soyuz program also used apollo hardware for the first joint nation spaceflight paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the space shuttle and international space station programs
in japan aerospace exploration agencys selene probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the apollo lunar module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface
beginning in nasas robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter while orbiting above the moon photographed the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface and each site where crewed apollo flights landed
all of the us flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing with the exception of the one left during the apollo mission which was blown over during that missions lift off from the lunar surface the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown
the flags cannot be seen through a telescope from earth
the apollo program has been described as the greatest technological achievement in human history
apollo stimulated many areas of technology leading to over spinoff products as of including advances in the development of cordless power tools fireproof materials heart monitors solar panels digital imaging and the use of liquid methane as fuel
the flight computer design used in both the lunar and command modules was along with the polaris and minuteman missile systems the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits
by apollo was using percent of the united states production of ics
the crucial difference between the requirements of apollo and the missile programs was apollos much greater need for reliability
while the navy and air force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles the political and financial cost of failure of an apollo mission was unacceptably high
technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini
the apollo project was enabled by nasas adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors in the interplanetary monitoring platform and silicon integrated circuit chips in the apollo guidance computer
the crew of apollo sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth and read from the creation story in the book of genesis on christmas eve
an estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw either live or delayed the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the apollo moonwalk
the apollo program also affected environmental activism in the s due to photos taken by the astronauts
the most well known include earthrise taken by william anders on apollo and the blue marble taken by the apollo astronauts
the blue marble was released during a surge in environmentalism and became a symbol of the environmental movement as a depiction of earths frailty vulnerability and isolation amid the vast expanse of space
according to the economist apollo succeeded in accomplishing president kennedys goal of taking on the soviet union in the space race by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement to demonstrate the superiority of the free market system
the publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast centralized government bureaucracy
prior to apollo s th anniversary in nasa searched for the original videotapes of the missions live televised moonwalk
after an exhaustive three year search it was concluded that the tapes had probably been erased and reused
a new digitally remastered version of the best available broadcast television footage was released instead
an assault is the illegal act of causing physical harm or unwanted physical contact to another person or in some legal definitions the threat or attempt to do so
it is both a crime and a tort and therefore may result in criminal prosecution civil liability or both
additionally assault is a criminal act in which a person intentionally causes fear of physical harm or offensive contact to another person
assault can be committed with or without a weapon and can range from physical violence to threats of violence
assault is frequently referred to as an attempt to commit battery which is the deliberate use of physical force against another person
the deliberate inflicting of fear apprehension or terror is another definition of assault that can be found in several legal systems
depending on the severity of the offense assault may result in a fine imprisonment or even death
generally the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law
traditionally common law legal systems have separate definitions for assault and battery
when this distinction is observed battery refers to the actual bodily contact whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery
some jurisdictions combined the two offenses into a single crime called assault and battery which then became widely referred to as assault
the result is that in many of these jurisdictions assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery
the legal systems of civil law and scots law have never distinguished assault from battery
legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity
in the united states an assault can be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony
in england and wales and australia it can be charged as either common assault assault occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm
canada also has a three tier system assault assault causing bodily harm and aggravated assault
separate charges typically exist for sexual assaults affray and assaulting a police officer
assault may overlap with an attempted crime for example an assault may be charged as attempted murder if it was done with intent to kill
battery is a criminal offense that involves the use of physical force against another person without their consent
it is a type of assault and is considered a serious crime
battery can include a wide range of actions from slapping someone to causing serious harm or even death
depending on the severity of the offense it can carry a wide range of punishments including jail time fines and probation
in jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two assault usually accompanies battery if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat
see common assault
the elements of battery are that it is a volitional act done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and which causes such contact
aggravated assault is a violent crime that involves violence or the threat of violence
it is generally described as an intentional act that causes another person to fear imminent physical harm or injury
this can include the use of a weapon or the threat of using a weapon
it is usually considered a felony offense and can carry severe penalties
aggravated assault is often considered a very serious crime and can lead to long term prison sentences
aggravated assault is in some jurisdictions a stronger form of assault usually using a deadly weapon
a person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants
exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as de minimis harm
assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others
consent may be a complete or partial defense to assault
in some jurisdictions most notably england it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault
this can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity the most notable case being the operation spanner case
legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery activities within the rules of a game bodily adornment or horseplay
however any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent
in scottish law consent is not a defense for assault
police officers and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an arrest or generally carrying out their official duties
thus a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary
in some jurisdictions such as singapore judicial corporal punishment is part of the legal system
the officers who administer the punishment have immunity from prosecution for assault
in the united states england northern ireland australia and canada corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable
what constitutes reasonable varies in both statutory law and case law
unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for child abuse
in english law s
children act limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault
this defence was abolished in wales in
many countries including some us states also permit the use of corporal punishment for children in school
this may or may not involve self defense in that using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence
some jurisdictions allow force to be used in defense of property to prevent damage either in its own right or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime subject to the need to deter vigilantes and excessive self help
furthermore some jurisdictions such as ohio allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder
the resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruders presence
the following are the countries with the most cases of assault according to the united nations in
the term assault when used in legislation commonly refers to both common assault and battery even though the two offences remain distinct
common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force
each state has legislation relating to the act of assault and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the magistrates court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a district or supreme court of that state
the legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault
in new south wales the crimes act defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties
these include assault is an offence under s
of the canadian criminal code
there is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur
generally an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent
it can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force or threatens to do so without the consent of the other person
an injury need not occur for an assault to be committed but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force
it can be an assault to tap pinch push or direct another such minor action toward another but an accidental application of force is not an assault
the potential punishment for an assault in canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed
the criminal code defines assault as a dual offence
police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the publics interest to do so notwithstanding s of the code
this public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim
an individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon assault causing bodily harm aggravated assault or any sexual assault
consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused
a person cannot consent to serious bodily harm
assault in ancient greece was normally termed hubris
contrary to modern usage the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening pride self confidence or arrogance often resulting in fatal retribution
in ancient greece hubris referred to actions which intentionally or not shamed and humiliated the victim and frequently the perpetrator as well
it was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich
violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities or the theft of public or sacred property
two well known cases are found in the speeches of demosthenes a prominent statesman and orator in ancient greece
these two examples occurred when first in addition to other acts of violence meidias allegedly punched demosthenes in the face in the theater and second when the defendant allegedly severely beat him
hubris though not specifically defined was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical athens
it was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient greek world
that was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved
the category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse or a humiliation of a defeated foe or irreverent outrageous treatment in general
the meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern english usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws
such an act may be referred to as an act of hubris or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic
at greek for ruin folly delusion is the action performed by the hero usually because of their hubris or great pride that leads to their death or downfall
crucial to this definition are the ancient greek concepts of honor and shame
the concept of tim included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris
this concept of honor is akin to a zero sum game
rush rehm simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of insolence contempt and excessive violence
the indian penal code covers the punishments and types of assault in chapter sections through
the code further explains that mere words do not amount to an assault
but the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault
assault is in indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force
the attempt itself has been made an offence in india as in other states
the criminal code act creates a number of offences of assault
assault is defined by section of that act
assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment assault with intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her or who indecently assaults another or who commits other more serious variants of assault are guilty of a felony and longer prison terms are provided for

south african law does not draw the distinction between assault and battery
assault is a common law crime defined as unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him
the law also recognises the crime of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm where grievous bodily harm is defined as harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health
the common law crime of indecent assault was repealed by the criminal law amendment act and replaced by a statutory crime of sexual assault
english law provides for two offences of assault common assault and battery
assault is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence
violence in this context means any unlawful touching though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile
the terms assault and common assault often encompass the separate offence of battery even in statutory settings such as s of the criminal justice act
a common assault is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty
section of the criminal justice act provides that common assault like battery is triable only in the magistrates court in england and wales
additionally if a defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm or racially religiously aggravated assault then a jury in the crown court may acquit the defendant of the more serious offence but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed
an assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing actual bodily harm or in the severest cases grievous bodily harm
in scots law assault is defined as an attack upon the person of another
there is no distinction made in scotland between assault and battery although as in england and wales assault can be occasioned without a physical attack on anothers person as demonstrated in atkinson v
hm advocate wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a ski mask
the court said scots law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury the use of a weapon or hamesucken
the mens rea for assault is simply evil intent although this has been held to mean no more than that assault cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently as upheld in lord advocates reference no of where it was found that a hold up in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence
it is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty under section police and fire reform act act which provides that it is an offence for a person to amongst other things assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty
several offences of assault exist in northern ireland
the offences against the person act creates the offences of that act formerly created the offence of assault on a constable in the execution of his duty
under section but that section has been superseded by section of the police act which now provides that it is an offence for a person to amongst other things assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty
in the united states assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a battery
however the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended but the defendants act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur
as the criminal law evolved element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice
these four elements were eventually codified in most states
the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be a natural person
thus unless the attack is directed by a person an animal attack does not constitute an assault
however under limited circumstances the unborn victims of violence act of treats a fetus as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes
laws on assault vary by state
since each state has its own criminal laws there is no universal assault law
acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as battery menacing intimidation reckless endangerment etc
in another state
assault is often subdivided into two categories simple assault and aggravated assault
in some states consent is a complete defense to assault
in other jurisdictions mutual consent is an incomplete defense to an assault charge such that an assault charge is prosecuted as a less significant offense such as a petty misdemeanor
states vary on whether it is possible to commit an attempted assault since it can be considered a double inchoate offense
in new york state assault requires an actual injury
other states define this as battery there is no crime of battery in new york
however in new york if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact that is called menacing
a person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree if they have a previous conviction for the same offense
new york also has specific laws against hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization
a person convicted of simple assault can be ordered to up to two years in prison as a second degree misdemeanor
a person convicted of aggravated assault can face up to years in prison as a second degree felony
however if the crime is perpetrated against a firefighter or police officer the offender may face first degree felony charges carrying a penalty of up to years in prison
in norse cosmology lfheimr also called ljslfheimr is home of the light elves
lfheim as an abode of the elves is mentioned only twice in old norse texts
a tooth gift is a gift given to an infant on the cutting of the first tooth
in norse mythology ask and embla male and female respectively were the first two humans created by the gods
the pair are attested in both the poetic edda compiled in the th century from earlier traditional sources and the prose edda written in the th century by snorri sturluson
in both sources three gods one of whom is odin find ask and embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts
a number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures and there are occasional references to them in popular culture
old norse literally means ash tree but the etymology of embla is uncertain and two possibilities of the meaning of embla are generally proposed
the first meaning elm tree is problematic and is reached by deriving elm la from almiln and subsequently to
the second suggestion is vine which is reached through ambil which may be related to the greek term itself meaning vine liana
the latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories
linguist gunlg josefsson claims that the name embla comes from the roots eim la which would then mean firemaker or smokebringer
she connects this to the ancient practice of creating fire through a fire plough which was considered a magical and holy way of fire making in folk belief in scandinavia long into modern times
she identifies the emergence of fire through the plowing symbolically to the moment of orgasm and hence fertilization and reproductiveness
according to benjamin thorpe grimm says the word embla emla signifies a busy woman from amr ambr aml ambl assiduous labour the same relation as meshia and meshiane the ancient persian names of the first man and woman who were also formed from trees
in stanza of the poetic edda poem the seeress reciting the poem states that hnir lurr and odin once found ask and embla on land
the seeress says that the two were capable of very little lacking in and says that they were given three gifts by the three gods the meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary
according to chapter of the prose edda book the three brothers vili v and odin are the creators of the first man and woman
the brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there
they took the wood and from it created the first human beings ask and embla
one of the three gave them the breath of life the second gave them movement and intelligence and the third gave them shape speech hearing and sight
further the three gods gave them clothing and names
ask and embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of midgard
a proto indo european basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of embla meaning vine
in indo european societies an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and sexual intercourse
vines were used as a flammable wood where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood resulting in fire
further evidence of ritual making of fire in scandinavia has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a bronze age grave in kivik scania sweden
jaan puhvel comments that ancient myths teem with trite first couples similar to the type of adam and his by product eve
in indo european tradition these range from the vedic yama and yam and the iranian maya and maynag to the icelandic askr and embla with trees or rocks as preferred raw material and dragons teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure
in his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in indo european society anders hultgrd observes that myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient europe and indo europe and indo european speaking peoples of asia minor and iran
by contrast the cultures of the near east show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive mans origin from clay earth or blood by means of a divine creation act
two wooden figures the braak bog figures of more than human height were unearthed from a peat bog at braak in schleswig germany
the figures depict a nude male and a nude female
hilda ellis davidson comments that these figures may represent a lord and lady of the vanir a group of norse gods and that another memory of wooden deities may survive in the tradition of the creation of ask and embla the man and woman who founded the human race created by the gods from trees on the seashore
a figure named sc appears as the son of hengest in the anglo saxon genealogy for the kings of kent
this has resulted in a number of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre norse germanic mythology
connections have been proposed between ask and embla and the vandal kings assi and ambri attested in paul the deacons th century ad work origo gentis langobardorum
there the two ask the god godan for victory
the name ambri like embla likely derives from ambil
a stanza preceding the account of the creation of ask and embla in vlusp provides a catalog of dwarfs and stanza has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth
this may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans and that the three gods gave them life
carolyne larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in old norse works due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees ask and embla
ask and embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions
a sculpture depicting the two created by stig blomberg in stands in slvesborg in southern sweden
ask and embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels by dagfin werenskiold on oslo city hall
ask to embla is the title of a poem parts of which are quoted by r
ash one of the protagonists in a
byatts novel possession a romance which won the booker prize in
in the video game fire emblem heroes the two main warring kingdoms are askr and embla which is where the summoner the player finds themselves in as the kingdom has been at war with the emblian empire when the game starts
it is later revealed both kingdoms are named after a pair of ancient dragons with askr being male and embla female
the alabama river in the us state of alabama is formed by the tallapoosa and coosa rivers which unite about north of montgomery near the town of wetumpka
the river flows west to selma then southwest until about from mobile it unites with the tombigbee forming the mobile and tensaw rivers which discharge into mobile bay
the run of the alabama is highly meandering
its width varies from and its depth from
its length as measured by the united states geological survey is and by steamboat measurement
the river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state
railways connect it with the mineral regions of north central alabama
after the coosa and tallapoosa rivers the principal tributary of the alabama is the cahaba river which is about long and joins the alabama river about below selma
the alabama rivers main tributary the coosa river crosses the mineral region of alabama and is navigable for light draft boats from rome georgia to about above wetumpka and from wetumpka to its junction with the tallapoosa
the channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government
the navigation of the tallapoosa river which has its source in paulding county georgia and is about long is prevented by shoals and a fall at tallassee a few miles north of its junction with the coosa
the alabama is navigable throughout the year
the river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the th century as a source of transportation of goods which included slaves
the river is still used for transportation of farming produce however it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways
documented by europeans first in the alabama coosa and tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the creek indians before their removal by united states forces to the indian territory in the s
the alabama river has three lock and dams between montgomery and the mobile river
the robert f
henry lock dam is located at river mile the millers ferry lock dam is located at river mile and the claiborne lock dam is located at river mile alain de lille was a french theologian and poet
he was born in lille some time before
his exact date of death remains unclear as well with most research pointing toward it being between april and april
he is known for writing a number of works on that are based upon the teachings of the liberal arts with one of his most renowned poems de planctu naturae focusing on human nature in regard to sexual conduct
although alain was widely known during his lifetime there is not a great deal known about his personal life with the majority of our knowledge of the theologian coming from the content of his works
as a theologian alain de lille opposed scholasticism in the second half of the th century
his philosophy is characterized by rationalism and mysticism
alan claimed that reason guided by prudence could discover most truths about the physical order without help but in order to understand religious truth and to know god the wise must believe in faith
little is known of his life
alain entered the schools no earlier than the late s first attending the school at paris and then at chartres
he probably studied under masters such as peter abelard gilbert of poitiers and thierry of chartres
this is known through the writings of john of salisbury who is thought to have been a contemporary student of alain of lille
his earliest writings were probably written in the s and probably in paris
alain spent many years as a professor of theology at the university of paris and he attended the lateran council in
though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in paris and taught there as well as some time in southern france into his old age
he afterwards inhabited montpellier lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister and finally retired to cteaux where he died in
he had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge caused him to be called doctor universalis
many of alains writings are unable to be exactly dated and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well
however it does seem clear that his first notable work summa quoniam homines was completed somewhere between and with the most conclusive date being and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in paris
among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the latin literature of the middle ages one of these the de planctu naturae is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity
he created the allegory of grammatical conjugation which was to have its successors throughout the middle ages
the anticlaudianus a treatise on morals as allegory the form of which recalls the pamphlet of claudian against rufinus is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity
as a theologian alain de lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the th century against the scholastic philosophy
his mysticism however is far from being as absolute as that of the victorines
in the anticlaudianus he sums up as follows reason guided by prudence can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith
this rule is completed in his treatise ars catholicae fidei as follows theology itself may be demonstrated by reason
alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the creed
this bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection that gives his treatise its apparent originality
alans philosophy was a sort of mixture of aristotelian logic and neoplatonic philosophy
the platonist seemed to outweigh the aristotelian in alan but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much aristotelian logic combined with pythagorean mathematics
one of alains most notable works was one he modeled after boethius consolation of philosophy to which he gave the title de planctu naturae or the plaint of nature and which was most likely written in the late s
in this work alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of god
he also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality has defiled itself from nature and god
in anticlaudianus another of his notable works alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man
she has only the ability to create a soulless body and thus she is persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul and the seven liberal arts produce a chariot for her
the five senses are the horses
the anticlaudianus was translated into french and german in the following century and toward was re worked into a musical anthology by adam de la basse
one of alans most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching ars praedicandi or the art of preaching
this work shows how alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be used as a practical manual when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching
alain wrote three very large theological textbooks one being his first work summa quoniam homines
another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus is his de fide catholica dated somewhere between and alan sets out to refute heretical views specifically that of the waldensians and cathars
in his third theological textbook regulae caelestis iuris he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules this was typical of the followers of gilbert of poitiers of which alan could be associated
other than these theological textbooks and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry alan of lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects primarily including speculative theology theoretical moral theology practical moral theology and various collections of poems
alain de lille has often been confounded with other persons named alain in particular with another alanus alan abbot of tewkesbury alain de podio etc
certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him as well as some of their works thus the life of st bernard should be ascribed to alain of auxerre and the commentary upon merlin to alan of tewkesbury
alan of lille was not the author of a memoriale rerum difficilium published under his name nor of moralium dogma philosophorum nor of the satirical apocalypse of golias once attributed to him and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the dicta alani de lapide philosophico really issued from his pen
on the other hand it now seems practically demonstrated that alain de lille was the author of the ars catholicae fidei and the treatise contra haereticos
in his sermons on capital sins alain argued that sodomy and homicide are the most serious sins since they call forth the wrath of god which led to the destruction of sodom and gomorrah
his chief work on penance the liber poenitenitalis dedicated to henry de sully exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the fourth lateran council
alains identification of the sins against nature included bestiality masturbation oral and anal intercourse incest adultery and rape
in addition to his battle against moral decay alan wrote a work against islam judaism and christian heretics dedicated to william viii of montpellier
the alemanni or alamanni were a confederation of germanic tribes on the upper rhine river during the first millennium
first mentioned by cassius dio in the context of the campaign of roman emperor caracalla of the alemanni captured the in and later expanded into present day alsace and northern switzerland leading to the establishment of the old high german language in those regions which by the eighth century were collectively referred to as alamannia
in the alemanni were conquered by the frankish leader clovis and incorporated into his dominions
mentioned as still pagan allies of the christian franks the alemanni were gradually christianized during the seventh century
the is a record of their customary law during this period
until the eighth century frankish suzerainty over alemannia was mostly nominal
after an uprising by theudebald duke of alamannia however carloman executed the alamannic nobility and installed frankish dukes
during the later and weaker years of the carolingian empire the alemannic counts became almost independent and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the bishopric of constance
the chief family in alamannia was that of the counts of who were sometimes called margraves and one of whom burchard ii established the duchy of swabia which was recognized by henry the fowler in and became a stem duchy of the holy roman empire
the area settled by the alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where alemannic german dialects remain spoken including german swabia and baden french alsace german speaking switzerland liechtenstein and austrian vorarlberg
the french language name of germany is derived from their name from old french aleman and from french was loaned into a number of other languages including middle english which commonly used the term almains for germans
likewise the arabic name for germany is the turkish is almanya the spanish is alemania the portuguese is alemanha the welsh is yr almaen and the persian is
according to gaius asinius quadratus the name alamanni means all men
it indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various germanic tribes
the romans and the greeks called them as such
this derivation was accepted by edward gibbon in his decline and fall of the roman empire and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of nicolas frret published in
this etymology has remained the standard derivation of the name
an alternative suggestion proposes derivation from alah sanctuary
walafrid strabo in the ninth century remarked in discussing the people of switzerland and the surrounding regions that only foreigners called them the alemanni but that they gave themselves the name of suebi
the suebi are given the alternative name of ziuwari in an old high german gloss interpreted by jacob grimm as martem colentes
annio da viterbo a scholar and historian of the th century claimed the alemanni had their name from the hebrew language as in hebrew the river rhine was translated into mannum and the people who live at its shores were called alemannus
this was refuted by beatus rhenanus a humanist of the th century
rhenanus argued the term alemanni was meant for the whole germanic people only in late antiquity and before it was only meant to designate the population of an island in the north sea
early roman writers did not mention the alemanni and it is likely that they had not yet come to exist
in his germania tacitus does not mention the alemanni
he uses the term agri decumates to describe the region between the rhine main and danube rivers
he says that it had once been the home of the helvetians who had moved westwards into gaul in the time of julius caesar
the people living there in caesars time are not germanic
instead reckless adventurers from gaul emboldened by want occupied this land of questionable ownership
after a while our frontier having been advanced and our military positions pushed forward it was regarded as a remote nook of our empire and a part of a roman province
the alemanni were first mentioned by cassius dio describing the campaign of caracalla in
at that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the main to the south of the chatti
cassius dio portrays the alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor
they had asked for his help according to dio but instead he colonized their country changed their place names and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid
when he became ill the alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him
caracalla it was claimed tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits
in retribution caracalla then led the legio ii traiana fortis against the alemanni who lost and were pacified for a time
the legion was as a result honored with the name germanica
the fourth century fictional historia augusta life of antoninus caracalla relates that caracalla then assumed the name alemannicus at which helvius pertinax jested that he should really be called geticus maximus because in the year before he had murdered his brother geta
through much of his short reign caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations
if he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries
whether or not the alemanni had been previously neutral they were certainly further influenced by caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of rome
this mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the roman writers persisted in calling the alemanni barbari meaning savages
the archaeology however shows that they were largely romanized lived in roman style houses and used roman artifacts the alemannic women having adopted the roman fashion of the tunica even earlier than the men
most of the alemanni were probably at the time in fact resident in or close to the borders of germania superior
although dio is the earliest writer to mention them ammianus marcellinus used the name to refer to germans on the limes germanicus in the time of trajans governorship of the province shortly after it was formed around ad
at that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time
trees from the earliest fortifications found in germania inferior are dated by dendrochronology to ad
ammianus relates that much later the emperor julian undertook a punitive expedition against the alemanni who by then were in alsace and crossed the main entering the forest where the trails were blocked by felled trees
as winter was upon them they reoccupied a fortification which was founded on the soil of the alemanni that trajan wished to be called with his own name
in this context the use of alemanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that ammianus believed they were the same people which is consistent with the location of the alemanni of caracallas campaigns
the alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the roman empire in the third and fourth centuries
they launched a major invasion of gaul and northern italy in when the romans were forced to denude much of their german frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the goths from the east
their raids throughout the three parts of gaul were traumatic gregory of tours mentions their destructive force at the time of valerian and gallienus when the alemanni assembled under their king whom he calls chrocus who acted by the advice it is said of his wicked mother and overran the whole of the gauls and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times
and coming to clermont he set on fire overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call vasso galatae in the gallic tongue martyring many christians
thus sixth century gallo romans of gregorys class surrounded by the ruins of roman temples and public buildings attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the alemanni
in the early summer of the emperor gallienus halted their advance into italy but then had to deal with the goths
when the gothic campaign ended in roman victory at the battle of naissus in september gallienus successor claudius gothicus turned north to deal with the alemanni who were swarming over all italy north of the po river
after efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed claudius forced the alemanni to battle at the battle of lake benacus in november
the alemanni were routed forced back into germany and did not threaten roman territory for many years afterwards
their most famous battle against rome took place in argentoratum in where they were defeated by julian later emperor of rome and their king chnodomarius was taken prisoner to rome
on january the alemanni yet again crossed the frozen rhine in large numbers to invade the gallic provinces this time being defeated by valentinian
in the great mixed invasion of the alemanni appear to have crossed the rhine river a final time conquering and then settling what is today alsace and a large part of the swiss plateau
the crossing is described in wallace breems historical novel eagle in the snow
the chronicle of fredegar gives the account
at alba augusta the devastation was so complete that the christian bishop retired to viviers but in gregorys account at mende in lozre also deep in the heart of gaul bishop privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated
it is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence
the kingdom of alamannia between strasbourg and augsburg lasted until when the alemanni were conquered by clovis i at the battle of tolbiac
the war of clovis with the alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of clovis briefly treated by gregory of tours
after their defeat in the alemanni bucked the frankish yoke and put themselves under the protection of theodoric the great of the ostrogoths but after his death they were again subjugated by the franks under theudebert i in
subsequently the alemanni formed part of the frankish dominions and were governed by a frankish duke
in carloman ended an uprising by summarily executing all alemannic nobility at the blood court at cannstatt and for the following century alemannia was ruled by frankish dukes
following the treaty of verdun of alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of louis the german the precursor of the holy roman empire
the duchy persisted until
the german spoken today over the range of the former alemanni is termed alemannic german and is recognised among the subgroups of the high german languages
alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the pforzen buckle are among the earliest testimonies of old high german
the high german consonant shift is thought to have originated around the fifth century either in alemannia or among the lombards before that the dialect spoken by alemannic tribes was little different from that of other west germanic peoples
alemannia lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when charles martel absorbed it into the frankish empire early in the eighth century
today alemannic is a linguistic term referring to alemannic german encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of baden wrttemberg in western bavaria in vorarlberg swiss german in switzerland and the alsatian language of the alsace
the alemanni established a series of territorially defined pagi on the east bank of the rhine
the exact number and extent of these pagi is unclear and probably changed over time
pagi usually pairs of pagi combined formed kingdoms which it is generally believed were permanent and hereditary
ammianus describes alemanni rulers with various terms reges excelsiores ante alios reges proximi reguli and regales
this may be a formal hierarchy or they may be vague overlapping terms or a combination of both
in there appear to have been two paramount kings who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings
their territories were small and mostly strung along the rhine
it is possible that the reguli were the rulers of the two pagi in each kingdom
underneath the royal class were the nobles and warriors
the warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men
each nobleman could raise an average of c
the christianization of the alemanni took place during merovingian times
we know that in the sixth century the alemanni were predominantly pagan and in the eighth century they were predominantly christian
the intervening seventh century was a period of genuine syncretism during which christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence
some scholars have speculated that members of the alemannic elite such as king gibuld due to visigothic influence may have been converted to arianism even in the later fifth century
in the mid th century the byzantine historian agathias records in the context of the wars of the goths and franks against byzantium that the alemanni fighting among the troops of frankish king theudebald were like the franks in all respects except religion since he also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the alemanni in destroying christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries
agathias expresses his hope that the alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the franks which is by all appearances in a manner of speaking what eventually happened
apostles of the alemanni were columbanus and his disciple saint gall
jonas of bobbio records that columbanus was active in bregenz where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to wodan
despite these activities for some time the alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities with only superficial or syncretistic christian elements
in particular there is no change in burial practice and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout merovingian times
syncretism of traditional germanic animal style with christian symbolism is also present in artwork but christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the seventh century
unlike the later christianization of the saxons and of the slavs the alemanni seem to have adopted christianity gradually and voluntarily spread in emulation of the merovingian elite
from c
the s to the s there was a surge of alemannic elder futhark inscriptions
about specimens have survived roughly half of them on fibulae others on belt buckles and other jewelry and weapon parts
use of runes subsides with the advance of christianity
the nordendorf fibula clearly records pagan theonyms logaorewodanwigionar read as wodan and donar are magicians sorcerers but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities or a christian protective charm against them
a runic inscription on a fibula found at bad ems reflects christian pious sentiment reading god fura dih deofile
dated to between ad and it marks the end of the native alemannic tradition of runic literacy
bad ems is in rhineland palatinate on the northwestern boundary of alemannic settlement where frankish influence would have been strongest
the establishment of the bishopric of konstanz cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by columbanus himself
in any case it existed by when gunzo appointed john of grab bishop
constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands and did not look back on late roman church history unlike the raetian bishopric of chur and basel
the establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history
in the early seventh century pactus alamannorum hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church while lantfrids lex alamannorum of has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone
a genetic study published in science advances in september examined the remains of eight individuals buried at a seventh century alemannic graveyard in niederstotzingen germany
this is the richest and most complete alemannic graveyard ever found
the highest ranking individual at the graveyard was a male with frankish grave goods
four males were found to be closely related to him
they were all carriers of types of the paternal haplogroup rbaaacbb
a sixth male was a carrier of the paternal haplogroup rbaaacbba and the maternal haplogroup uaa
along with the five closely related individuals he displayed close genetic links to northern and eastern europe particularly lithuania and iceland
two individuals buried at the cemetery were found to be genetically different from both the others and each other displaying genetic links to southern europe particularly northern italy and spain
along with the sixth male they might have been adoptees or slaves
nyse american formerly known as the american stock exchange and more recently as nyse mkt is an american stock exchange situated in new york city
amex was previously a mutual organization owned by its members
until it was known as the new york curb exchange
nyse euronext acquired amex on october with amex integrated with the alternext european small cap exchange and renamed the nyse alternext us in march nyse alternext us was changed to nyse amex equities
on may nyse amex equities changed its name to nyse mkt llc
following the sec approval of competing stock exchange iex in nyse mkt rebranded as nyse american and introduced a microsecond delay in trading referred to as a speed bump which is also present on the iex
the exchange grew out of the loosely organized curb market of curbstone brokers on broad street in manhattan
efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the th century under emanuel s
mendels and carl h
the curb brokers had been kicked out of the mills building front by and had moved to the pavement outside the blair building where cabbies lined up
there they were given a little domain of asphalt fenced off by the police on broad street between exchange place and beaver street
as of the curb market operated starting at am each day except sundays until a gong at pm
orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage
as of e
mendels gave the brokers rules by right of seniority but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing
according to the times this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships
however in the new york curb market agency was established which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers organized by mendels
the informal curb association formed in to weed out undesirables
the curb exchange was for years at odds with the new york stock exchange or big board operating several buildings away
explained the new york times in the big board looked at the curb as a trading place for cats and dogs
on april however when the nyse abolished its unlisted department the nyse stocks made homeless by the abolition were refused domicile by the curb brokers on broad street until they had complied with the curb list of requirements
in mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the new york curb market association which can be considered the first formal constitution of american stock exchange
in journalist edwin c
hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower broad street was a roaring swirling whirlpool that tears control of a gold mine from an unlucky operator and pauses to auction a puppy dog
it is like nothing else under the astonished sky that is its only roof
after a group of curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building starrett van vleck designed the new exchange building on greenwich street in lower manhattan between thames and rector at trinity place
it opened in and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on june
in the new york curb market changed its name to the new york curb exchange
the curb exchange soon became the leading international stock market and according to historian robert sobel had more individual foreign issues on its list than
all other american securities markets combined
edward reid mccormick was the first president of the new york curb market association and is credited with moving the market indoors
george rea was approached about the position of president of the new york curb exchange in
he was unanimously elected as the first paid president in the history of the curb exchange
he was paid per year and held the position for three years before offering his resignation in
he left the position having done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full time successor
in the curb exchange was renamed the american stock exchange
the exchange was shaken by a scandal in and in began a reorganization
its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement in the american stock exchange named edwin etherington its president
writes cnn he and executive vice president paul kolton were tapped in to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal plagued american stock exchange
as of it was the second largest stock exchange in the united states
paul kolton succeeded ralph s
saul as amex president on june making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader succeeding ralph s
saul who announced his resignation in march
in november kolton was named as the exchanges first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive
as chairman kolton oversaw the introduction of options trading
kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the new york stock exchange while he headed the exchange saying that two independent viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution
kolton announced in july that he would be leaving his position at the american exchange in november of that year
in thomas peterffy purchased a seat on the american stock exchange
peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early s
etfs or exchange traded funds had their genesis in with index participation shares an sp proxy that traded on the american stock exchange and the philadelphia stock exchange
this product was short lived after a lawsuit by the chicago mercantile exchange was successful in stopping sales in the united states
in a similar product toronto index participation shares which tracked the tse and later the tse indices started trading on the toronto stock exchange in
the popularity of these products led the american stock exchange to try to develop something that would satisfy regulations by the us securities and exchange commission
nathan most and steven bloom under the direction of ivers riley designed and developed standard poors depositary receipts which were introduced in january
known as spdrs or spiders the fund became the largest etf in the world
in may state street global advisors introduced the sp midcap spdrs
barclays in conjunction with msci and funds distributor inc
entered the market in with world equity benchmark shares which became ishares msci index fund shares
webs originally tracked msci country indices managed by the funds index provider morgan stanley
webs were particularly innovative because they gave casual investors easy access to foreign markets
while spdrs were organized as unit investment trusts webs were set up as a mutual fund the first of their kind
in state street global advisors introduced sector spiders separate etfs for each of the sectors of the sp index
also in the dow diamonds were introduced tracking the dow jones industrial average
in the influential cubes were launched with the goal of replicate the price movement of the nasdaq
the ishares line was launched in early
by it had a market share of etf assets under management
barclays global investors was sold to blackrock in
as of amex was the only us stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through hand signals
in october nyse euronext completed acquisition of the amex for million in stock
before the closing of the acquisition nyse euronext announced that the amex would be integrated with the alternext european small cap exchange and renamed the nyse alternext us the american stock exchange merged with the new york stock exchange on october
post merger the amex equities business was branded nyse alternext us
as part of the re branding exercise nyse alternext us was re branded as nyse amex equities
on december the curb exchange building at trinity place was closed and the amex equities trading floor was moved to the nyse trading floor at wall street
years after its opening the old new york curb market building was empty but remained standing
in march nyse alternext us was changed to nyse amex equities
on may nyse amex equities changed its name to nyse mkt llc
in june a competing stock exchange iex gained approval from the sec despite lobbying protests by the nyse and other exchanges and trading firms
on july the nyse renamed nyse mkt to nyse american and announced plans to introduce its own microsecond speed bump in trading on the small and mid cap company exchange
alfred russel wallace was an english naturalist explorer geographer anthropologist biologist and illustrator
he independently conceived the theory of evolution through natural selection his paper on the subject was published that year alongside extracts from charles darwins earlier writings on the topic
it spurred darwin to set aside the big species book he was drafting and quickly write an abstract of it which was published in as on the origin of species
wallace did extensive fieldwork starting in the amazon river basin
he then did fieldwork in the malay archipelago where he identified the faunal divide now termed the wallace line which separates the indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts a western portion in which the animals are largely of asian origin and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect australasia
he was considered the th centurys leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the father of biogeography or more specifically of zoogeography
wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the th century working on warning coloration in animals and reinforcement a way that natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation
wallaces book mans place in the universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets
he was one of the first scientists to write a serious exploration of whether there was life on mars
aside from scientific work he was a social activist critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system in th century britain
his advocacy of spiritualism and his belief in a non material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with other scientists
he was one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity
he wrote prolifically on both scientific and social issues his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in southeast asia the malay archipelago was first published in
it continues to be both popular and highly regarded
alfred russel wallace was born on january in llanbadoc monmouthshire
he was the eighth of nine children born to mary anne wallace and thomas vere wallace
his mother was english while his father was of scottish ancestry
his family claimed a connection to william wallace a leader of scottish forces during the wars of scottish independence in the th century
wallaces father graduated in law but never practised it
he owned some income generating property but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the familys financial position
wallaces mother was from a middle class family of hertford to which place his family moved when wallace was five years old
he attended hertford grammar school until when he reached the age of the normal leaving age for a pupil not going on to university
wallace then moved to london to board with his older brother john a year old apprentice builder
this was a stopgap measure until william his oldest brother was ready to take him on as an apprentice surveyor
while in london alfred attended lectures and read books at the london mechanics institute
here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the welsh social reformer robert owen and of the english born political theorist thomas paine
he left london in to live with william and work as his apprentice for six years
they moved repeatedly to different places in mid wales
then at the end of they moved to kington herefordshire near the welsh border before eventually settling at neath in wales
between and wallace worked as a land surveyor in the countryside of the west of england and wales
the natural history of his surroundings aroused his interest from he collected flowers and plants as an amateur botanist
one result of wallaces early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality
since he was born in monmouthshire some sources have considered him to be welsh
other historians have questioned this because neither of his parents were welsh his family only briefly lived in monmouthshire the welsh people wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be english and because he consistently referred to himself as english rather than welsh
one wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an englishman born in wales
in wallaces father died and a decline in demand for surveying meant williams business no longer had work available
for a short time wallace was unemployed then early in he was engaged by the collegiate school in leicester to teach drawing mapmaking and surveying
he had already read george combes the constitution of man and after spencer hall lectured on mesmerism wallace as well as some of the older pupils tried it out
wallace spent many hours at the town library in leicester he read an essay on the principle of population by thomas robert malthus alexander von humboldts personal narrative darwins journal and charles lyells principles of geology
one evening wallace met the entomologist henry bates who was years old and had published an paper on beetles in the journal zoologist
he befriended wallace and started him collecting insects
when wallaces brother william died in march wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brothers firm in neath but his brother john and he were unable to make the business work
after a few months he found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the vale of neath
wallaces work on the survey was largely outdoors in the countryside allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects
wallace persuaded his brother john to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm
it carried out projects including the design of a building for the neath mechanics institute founded in
william jevons the founder of that institute was impressed by wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering
in the autumn of john and he purchased a cottage near neath where they lived with their mother and sister fanny
during this period he exchanged letters with bates about books
he had re read darwins journal and said as the journal of a scientific traveller it is second only to humboldts personal narrative as a work of general interest perhaps superior to it
in wallace had been convinced by robert chamberss anonymously published treatise on progressive development vestiges of the natural history of creation and found bates to be more critical
inspired by the chronicles of earlier and contemporary travelling naturalists wallace decided to travel abroad
he later wrote that darwins journal and humboldts personal narrative were the two works to whose inspiration i owe my determination to visit the tropics as a collector
after reading a voyage up the river amazon by william henry edwards wallace and bates estimated that by collecting and selling natural history specimens such as birds and insects they could meet their costs with the prospect of good profits
they therefore engaged as their agent samuel stevens who would advertise and arrange sales to institutions and private collectors for a commission of on sales plus on despatching freight and remittances of money
in wallace and bates left for brazil aboard the mischief
they intended to collect insects and other animal specimens in the amazon rainforest for their private collections selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in britain to fund the trip
wallace hoped to gather evidence of the transmutation of species
bates and he spent most of their first year collecting near belm then explored inland separately occasionally meeting to discuss their findings
in they were briefly joined by another young explorer the botanist richard spruce along with wallaces younger brother herbert
herbert soon left but spruce like bates would spend over ten years collecting in south america
wallace spent four years charting the rio negro collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography flora and fauna
on july wallace embarked for the uk on the brig helen
after days at sea the ships cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship
all the specimens wallace had on the ship mostly collected during the last and most interesting two years of his trip were lost
he managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches but little else
wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig jordeson which was sailing from cuba to london
the jordeson provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers but after a difficult passage on short rations the ship reached its destination on october
the lost collection had been insured for by stevens
after his return to britain wallace spent months in london living on the insurance payment and selling a few specimens that had been shipped home
during this period despite having lost almost all the notes from his south american expedition he wrote six academic papers and two books palm trees of the amazon and their uses and travels on the amazon
at the same time he made connections with several other british naturalists
bates and others were collecting in the amazon area wallace was more interested in new opportunities in the malay archipelago as demonstrated by the travel writings of ida laura pfeiffer and valuable insect specimens she collected which stevens sold as her agent
in march wallace wrote to sir james brooke rajah of sarawak who was then in london and who arranged assistance in sarawak for wallace
in june wallace wrote to murchison at the royal geographical society for support proposing to again fund his exploring entirely from sale of duplicate collections
he later recalled that while researching in the insect room of the british museum he was introduced to darwin and they had a few minutes conversation
after presenting a paper and a large map of the rio negro to the rgs wallace was elected a fellow of the society on february
free passage arranged on royal navy ships was stalled by the crimean war but eventually the rgs funded first class travel by po steamships
wallace and a young assistant charles allen embarked at southampton on march
after the overland journey to suez and another change of ship at ceylon they disembarked at singapore on april
from to wallace travelled around the islands of the malay archipelago or east indies
his main objective was to obtain specimens of natural history both for my private collection and to supply duplicates to museums and amateurs
in addition to allen he generally employed one or two and sometimes three malay servants as assistants and paid large numbers of local people at various places to bring specimens
his total was specimens most of which were insects including more than beetles several thousand of the specimens represented species new to science overall more than thirty men worked for him at some stage as full time paid collectors
he also hired guides porters cooks and boat crews so well over individuals worked for him
after collecting expeditions to bukit timah hill in singapore and to malacca wallace and allen reached sarawak in october and were welcomed at kuching by sir james brookes heir captain john brooke
wallace hired a malay named ali as a general servant and cook and spent the early wet season in a small dyak house at the foot of mount santubong overlooking a branch outlet of the sarawak river
he read about species distribution and wrote his sarawak paper
in march he moved to the simunjon coal works operated by ludvig verner helms and supplemented collecting by paying workers a cent for each insect
a specimen of the previously unknown gliding tree frog rhacophorus nigropalmatus came from a chinese workman who told wallace that it glided down
local people also assisted with shooting orangutans
they spent time with sir james then in february allen chose to stay on with the missionaries at kuching
on reaching singapore in may wallace hired a bird skinner
with ali as cook they collected for two days on bali then from june to august on lombok
in december darwin had written to contacts worldwide to get specimens for his continuing research into variation under domestication
at lomboks port city ampanam wallace wrote telling his agent stevens about specimens shipped including a domestic duck variety for mr darwin he would perhaps also like the jungle cock which is often domesticated here is doubtless one of the originals of the domestic breed of poultry
in the same letter wallace said birds from bali and lombok divided by a narrow strait belong to two quite distinct zoological provinces of which they form the extreme limits java borneo sumatra and malacca and australia and the moluccas
stevens arranged publication of relevant paragraphs in the january issue of the zoologist
after further investigation the zoogeographical boundary eventually became known as the wallace line
ali became wallaces most trusted assistant a skilled collector and researcher
wallace collected and preserved the delicate insect specimens while most of the birds were collected and prepared by his assistants of those ali collected and prepared around
while exploring the archipelago wallace refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection
in he sent an article outlining his theory to darwin it was published along with a description of darwins theory that same year
accounts of wallaces studies and adventures were eventually published in as the malay archipelago
this became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the th century and has never been out of print
it was praised by scientists such as darwin by lyell and by non scientists such as the novelist joseph conrad
conrad called the book his favorite bedside companion and used information from it for several of his novels especially lord jim
a set of bird skeletons wallace collected in indonesia are held in the cambridge university museum of zoology and described as of exceptional historical significance
in wallace returned to england where he moved in with his sister fanny sims and her husband thomas
while recovering from his travels wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the zoological society of london
later that year he visited darwin at down house and became friendly with both lyell and the philosopher herbert spencer
during the s wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection
he corresponded with darwin about topics including sexual selection warning coloration and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species
in he began investigating spiritualism
after a year of courtship wallace became engaged in to a young woman whom in his autobiography he would only identify as miss l
miss l
was the daughter of lewis leslie who played chess with wallace but to wallaces great dismay she broke off the engagement
in wallace married annie mitten
wallace had been introduced to mitten through the botanist richard spruce who had befriended wallace in brazil and who was a friend of annie mittens father william mitten an expert on mosses
in wallace built the dell a house of concrete on land he leased in grays in essex where he lived until
the wallaces had three children herbert violet and william
in the late s and s wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family
while he was in the malay archipelago the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for wallace
on his return to the uk wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of the malay archipelago
despite assistance from his friends he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum
to remain financially solvent wallace worked grading government examinations wrote papers for publication between and for various modest sums and was paid by lyell and darwin to help edit some of their works
in wallace needed a advance from the publisher of the geographical distribution of animals to avoid having to sell some of his personal property
darwin was very aware of wallaces financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science
when the annual pension was awarded in it helped to stabilise wallaces financial position by supplementing the income from his writings
in wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed land nationalisation society
in the next year he published a book land nationalisation its necessity and its aims on the subject
he criticised the uks free trade policies for the negative impact they had on working class people
in wallace read looking backward by edward bellamy and declared himself a socialist despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor
after reading progress and poverty the bestselling book by the progressive land reformist henry george wallace described it as undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century
wallace opposed eugenics an idea supported by other prominent th century evolutionary thinkers on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit
in his article human selection he wrote those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent
he said the world does not want the eugenicist to set it straight give the people good conditions improve their environment and all will tend towards the highest type
eugenics is simply the meddlesome interference of an arrogant scientific priestcraft
in wallace wrote a paper advocating a pure paper money system not backed by silver or gold which impressed the economist irving fisher so much that he dedicated his book stabilizing the dollar to wallace
wallace wrote on other social and political topics including in support of womens suffrage and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism
in an essay he called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people that all modern wars are dynastic that they are caused by the ambition the interests the jealousies and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers and that the results of war are never good for the people who yet bear all its burthens
in a letter published by the daily mail in with aviation in its infancy he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft arguing against the idea that this new horror is inevitable and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of say ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemys capital from an invisible flight of airships
in wallace published the wonderful century its successes and its failures about developments in the th century
the first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century the second part covered what wallace considered to be its social failures including the destruction and waste of wars and arms races the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums the environmental damage caused by capitalism and the evils of european colonialism
wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life publishing the book the revolt of democracy just weeks before his death
in he published island life as a sequel to the geographic distribution of animals
in november wallace began a ten month trip to the united states to give a series of popular lectures
most of the lectures were on darwinism but he also gave speeches on biogeography spiritualism and socio economic reform
during the trip he was reunited with his brother john who had emigrated to california years before
he spent a week in colorado with the american botanist alice eastwood as his guide exploring the flora of the rocky mountains and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how glaciation might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of europe asia and north america which he published in in the paper english and american flowers
he met many other prominent american naturalists and viewed their collections
his book darwinism used information he collected on his american trip and information he had compiled for the lectures
on november wallace died at home aged in the country house he called old orchard which he had built a decade earlier
his death was widely reported in the press
the new york times called him the last of the giants to that wonderful group of intellectuals composed of darwin huxley spencer lyell owen and other scientists whose daring investigations revolutionized and evolutionized the thought of the century
another commentator in the same edition said no apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the malay archipelago
some of wallaces friends suggested that he be buried in westminster abbey but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at broadstone dorset
several prominent british scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of wallace placed in westminster abbey near where darwin had been buried
the medallion was unveiled on november
wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist who already believed in the transmutation of species
the concept had been advocated by jean baptiste lamarck geoffroy saint hilaire erasmus darwin and robert grant among others
it was widely discussed but not generally accepted by leading naturalists and was considered to have radical even revolutionary connotations
prominent anatomists and geologists such as georges cuvier richard owen adam sedgwick and lyell attacked transmutation vigorously
it has been suggested that wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics religion and science and because he was unusually open to marginal even fringe ideas in science
wallace was profoundly influenced by robert chamberss vestiges of the natural history of creation a controversial work of popular science published anonymously in
it advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system the earth and living things
wallace wrote to henry bates in describing it as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies but which remains to be proven by
more research
in he wrote to bates that he would like to take some one family beetles to study thoroughly
with a view to the theory of the origin of species
wallace planned fieldwork to test the evolutionary hypothesis that closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories
during his work in the amazon basin he came to realise that geographical barriers such as the amazon and its major tributaries often separated the ranges of closely allied species
he included these observations in his paper on the monkeys of the amazon
near the end of the paper he asked the question are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country in february while working in sarawak on the island of borneo wallace wrote on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species
the paper was published in the annals and magazine of natural history in september
in this paper he discussed observations of the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species a field that became biogeography
his conclusion that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species has come to be known as the sarawak law answering his own question in his paper on the monkeys of the amazon basin
although it does not mention possible mechanisms for evolution this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later
the paper challenged lyells belief that species were immutable
although darwin had written to him in expressing support for transmutation lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea
around the start of he told darwin about wallaces paper as did edward blyth who thought it good upon the whole
wallace has i think put the matter well and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into species
despite this hint darwin mistook wallaces conclusion for the progressive creationism of the time writing that it was nothing very new
uses my simile of tree it seems all creation with him
lyell was more impressed and opened a notebook on species in which he grappled with the consequences particularly for human ancestry
darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend joseph hooker and now for the first time spelt out the full details of natural selection to lyell
although lyell could not agree he urged darwin to publish to establish priority
darwin demurred at first but began writing up a species sketch of his continuing work in may
by february wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the malay archipelago that evolution was real
he later wrote in his autobiography that the problem was of how species change from one well marked form to another
he stated that it was while he was in bed with a fever that he thought about malthuss idea of positive checks on human population and had the idea of natural selection
his autobiography says that he was on the island of ternate at the time but the evidence of his journal suggests that he was in fact on the island of gilolo
from to he rented a house on ternate from the dutchman maarten dirk van renesse van duivenbode which he used as a base for expeditions to other islands such as gilolo
wallace had once briefly met darwin and was one of the correspondents whose observations darwin used to support his own theories
although wallaces first letter to darwin has been lost wallace carefully kept the letters he received
in the first letter dated may darwin commented that wallaces letter of october which he had recently received as well as wallaces paper on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species of showed that they thought alike with similar conclusions and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time
the second letter dated december said how glad he was that wallace was theorising about distribution adding that without speculation there is no good and original observation but commented that i believe i go much further than you
wallace believed this and sent darwin his february essay on the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type asking darwin to review it and pass it to charles lyell if he thought it worthwhile
although wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the malay archipelago the ternate essay was in a private letter
darwin received the essay on june
although the essay did not use darwins term natural selection it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures
in this sense it was very similar to the theory that darwin had worked on for years but had yet to publish
darwin sent the manuscript to charles lyell with a letter saying he could not have made a better short abstract even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters
he does not say he wishes me to publish but i shall of course at once write and offer to send to any journal
distraught about the illness of his baby son darwin put the problem to charles lyell and joseph hooker who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted darwins priority
wallaces essay was presented to the linnean society of london on july along with excerpts from an essay which darwin had disclosed privately to hooker in and a letter darwin had written to asa gray in
communication with wallace in the far off malay archipelago involved months of delay so he was not part of this rapid publication
wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact happy that he had been included at all and never expressed bitterness in public or in private
darwins social and scientific status was far greater than wallaces and it was unlikely that without darwin wallaces views on evolution would have been taken seriously
lyell and hookers arrangement relegated wallace to the position of co discoverer and he was not the social equal of darwin or the other prominent british natural scientists
all the same the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated wallace with the more famous darwin
this combined with darwins advocacy on his behalf would give wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community
the reaction to the reading was muted with the president of the linnean society remarking in may that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries but with darwins publication of on the origin of species later in its significance became apparent
when wallace returned to the uk he met darwin
although some of wallaces opinions in the ensuing years would test darwins patience they remained on friendly terms for the rest of darwins life
over the years a few people have questioned this version of events
in the early s two books one by arnold brackman and another by john langdon brooks suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob wallace of his proper credit but that darwin had actually stolen a key idea from wallace to finish his own theory
these claims have been examined and found unconvincing by a number of scholars
shipping schedules show that contrary to these accusations wallaces letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in darwins letter to lyell
after wallace returned to england in he became one of the staunchest defenders of darwins on the origin of species
in an incident in that particularly pleased darwin wallace published the short paper remarks on the rev
haughtons paper on the bees cell and on the origin of species
this rebutted a paper by a professor of geology at the university of dublin that had sharply criticised darwins comments in the origin on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection
an even longer defence was a article in the quarterly journal of science called creation by law
it reviewed george campbell the th duke of argylls book the reign of law which aimed to refute natural selection
after an meeting of the british science association wallace wrote to darwin complaining that there were no opponents left who know anything of natural history so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have
historians of science have noted that while darwin considered the ideas in wallaces paper to be essentially the same as his own there were differences
darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce whereas wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions leading populations in different locations to diverge
the historian of science peter j
bowler has suggested that in the paper he mailed to darwin wallace might have been discussing group selection
against this malcolm kottler showed that wallace was indeed discussing individual variation and selection
others have noted that wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism that kept species and varieties adapted to their environment
they point to a largely overlooked passage of wallaces famous paper in which he likened this principle
the centrifugal governor of the steam engine which checks and corrects any irregularities
the cybernetician and anthropologist gregory bateson observed in the s that although writing it only as an example wallace had probably said the most powerful thing thatd been said in the th century
bateson revisited the topic in his book mind and nature a necessary unity and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory
warning coloration was one of wallaces contributions to the evolutionary biology of animal coloration
in darwin wrote to wallace about a problem in explaining how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes
darwin had come to believe that many conspicuous animal colour schemes were due to sexual selection but he saw that this could not apply to caterpillars
wallace responded that he and bates had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste and that he had been told by john jenner weir that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable
since the moth was as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in daylight it seemed likely that the conspicuous colours served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection
darwin was impressed by the idea
at a later meeting of the entomological society wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic
in weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported wallaces idea
wallace attributed less importance than darwin to sexual selection
in his book tropical nature and other essays he wrote extensively about the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases darwin had attributed to sexual selection
he revisited the topic at length in his book darwinism
in he wrote a critical review in nature of his friend edward bagnall poultons the colours of animals which supported darwin on sexual selection attacking especially poultons claims on the aesthetic preferences of the insect world
in wallace wrote the book darwinism which explained and defended natural selection
in it he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation
thus it might contribute to the development of new species
he suggested the following scenario when two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point each adapted to particular conditions hybrid offspring would be less adapted than either parent form and so natural selection would tend to eliminate the hybrids
furthermore under such conditions natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species
this idea came to be known as the wallace effect later called reinforcement
wallace had suggested to darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as but had not worked it out to this level of detail
it continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity
in wallace published a paper the origin of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of natural selection applying the theory to humankind
darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject although thomas huxley had in evidence as to mans place in nature
wallace explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes
unlike some other darwinists including darwin himself he did not regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape
he saw the evolution of humans in two stages achieving a bipedal posture that freed the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain and the recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life
wallace seems to have been the first evolutionist to see that the human brain effectively made further specialisation of the body unnecessary
wallace wrote the paper for the anthropological society of london to address the debate between the supporters of monogenism the belief that all human races shared a common ancestor and were one species and the supporters of polygenism who held that different races had separate origins and were different species
wallaces anthropological observations of native americans in the amazon and especially his time living among the dayak people of borneo had convinced him that human beings were a single species with a common ancestor
he still felt that natural selection might have continued to act on mental faculties after the development of the different races and he did not dispute the nearly universal view among european anthropologists of the time that europeans were intellectually superior to other races
according to political scientist adam jones wallace found little difficulty in reconciling the extermination of native peoples with his progressive political views
in in the aforementioned paper he stated it is the same great law of the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life which leads to the inevitable extinction of all those low and mentally undeveloped populations with which europeans come in contact
he argued that the natives die out due to an unequal struggle
shortly afterwards wallace became a spiritualist
at about the same time he began to maintain that natural selection could not account for mathematical artistic or musical genius metaphysical musings or wit and humour
he stated that something in the unseen universe of spirit had interceded at least three times in history the creation of life from inorganic matter the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals and the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind
he believed that the of the universe was the development of the human spirit
while some historians have concluded that wallaces belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the higher functions of the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism other scholars have disagreed and some maintain that wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas
reaction to wallaces ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied
lyell endorsed wallaces views on human evolution rather than darwins
wallaces belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late th and early th centuries
all the same many including huxley hooker and darwin himself were critical of wallaces views
as the historian of science and sceptic michael shermer has stated wallaces views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging darwinian philosophy
these were that evolution was not teleological and that it was not anthropocentric
much later in his life wallace returned to these themes that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes
he set out his ideas in a magazine article entitled the world of life later expanded into a book of the same name
shermer commented that this anticipated ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from religious traditions throughout the th century
in many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of darwins own theory
in reality wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from darwins and was considered by many to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day whose ideas could not be ignored
one historian of science has pointed out that through both private correspondence and published works darwin and wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each others ideas and theories over an extended period
wallace is the most cited naturalist in darwins descent of man occasionally in strong disagreement
darwin and wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection and some of the factors responsible for it competition between species and geographical isolation
but wallace believed that evolution had a purpose in maintaining species fitness to their environment whereas darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process
scientific discoveries since the th century support darwins viewpoint by identifying additional mechanisms and triggers such as mutations triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals
wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life
by the s evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles but natural selection less so
wallaces darwinism was a response to the scientific critics of natural selection
of all wallaces books it is the most cited by scholarly publications
in at the urging of many of his friends including darwin philip sclater and alfred newton wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals
initial progress was slow in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux
he resumed the work in earnest in after the publication of a number of new works on classification
extending the system developed by sclater for birds which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution to cover mammals reptiles and insects as well wallace created the basis for the zoogeographic regions in use today
he discussed the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographic region
these factors included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges and the effects of periods of increased glaciation
he provided maps showing factors such as elevation of mountains depths of oceans and the character of regional vegetation that affected the distribution of animals
he summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions
the text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location
the resulting two volume work the geographical distribution of animals was published in and served as the definitive text on zoogeography for the next years
the book included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern species
for example he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the northern hemisphere migrating between north america and eurasia and then much more recently to south america after which the northern species became extinct leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in south america and southeast asia
wallace was very aware of and interested in the mass extinction of megafauna in the late pleistocene
in the geographical distribution of animals he wrote we live in a zoologically impoverished world from which all the hugest and fiercest and strangest forms have recently disappeared
he added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions was glaciation but by the time he wrote world of life he had come to believe those extinctions were due to mans agency
in wallace published the book island life as a sequel to the geographical distribution of animals
it surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands
wallace classified islands into oceanic and two types of continental islands
oceanic islands in his view such as the galapagos and hawaiian islands formed in mid ocean and never part of any large continent
such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians and their inhabitants were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution
continental islands in his scheme were divided into those that were recently separated from a continent and those much less recently
wallace discussed how that difference affected flora and fauna
he discussed how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals such as the lemurs of madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas
he extensively discussed how changes of climate particularly periods of increased glaciation may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages
island life was considered a very important work at the time of its publication
it was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence
wallaces extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world
in tropical nature and other essays he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall
noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate he warned that the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in ceylon and india would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their impoverishment due to soil erosion
in island life wallace again mentioned deforestation and invasive species
on the impact of european colonisation on the island of saint helena he wrote that the island was now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile
he explained that the soil was protected by the islands vegetation once that was destroyed the soil was washed off the steep slopes by heavy tropical rain leaving bare rock or sterile clay
he attributed the irreparable destruction to feral goats introduced in
the islands forests were further damaged by the reckless waste of the east india company from which used the bark of valuable redwood and ebony trees for tanning leaving the wood to rot unused
wallaces comments on environment grew more urgent later in his career
in the world of life he wrote that people should view nature as invested with a certain sanctity to be used by us but not abused and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced
wallaces book mans place in the universe was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets
he concluded that the earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase
his treatment of mars in this book was brief and in wallace returned to the subject with a book is mars habitable to criticise the claims made by the american astronomer percival lowell that there were martian canals built by intelligent beings
wallace did months of research consulted various experts and produced his own scientific analysis of the martian climate and atmospheric conditions
he pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapour in the martian atmosphere that lowells analysis of marss climate badly overestimated the surface temperature and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water let alone a planet girding irrigation system impossible
richard milner comments that wallace effectively debunked lowells illusionary network of martian canals
wallace became interested in the topic because his anthropocentric philosophy inclined him to believe that man would be unique in the universe
wallace was an enthusiast of phrenology
early in his career he experimented with hypnosis then known as mesmerism managing to hypnotise some of his students in leicester
when he began these experiments the topic was very controversial early experimenters such as john elliotson had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment
wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and spiritualism arguing that one should not deny observations on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility
wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of possibly at the urging of his older sister fanny sims
after reviewing the literature and attempting to test what he witnessed at sances he came to believe in it
for the rest of his life he remained convinced that at least some sance phenomena were genuine despite accusations of fraud and evidence of trickery
one biographer suggested that the emotional shock when his first fiance broke their engagement contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism
other scholars have emphasised his desire to find scientific explanations for all phenomena
in wallace visited the spirit photographer frederick hudson
he declared that a photograph of him with his deceased mother was genuine
others reached a different conclusion hudsons photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in
wallaces public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the s damaged his scientific reputation
in he published the evidence he believed proved his position in on miracles and modern spiritualism
his attitude permanently strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as henry bates thomas huxley and even darwin
others such as the physiologist william benjamin carpenter and zoologist e
ray lankester became publicly hostile to wallace over the issue
wallace was heavily criticised by the press the lancet was particularly harsh
when in darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to wallace joseph hooker responded that wallace has lost caste considerably not only by his adhesion to spiritualism but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the british association brought about a discussion on spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings
this he is said to have done in an underhanded manner and i well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the ba council
hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request
in a flat earth proponent named john hampden offered a wager in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river canal or lake
wallace intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a stretch of canal
both objects were at the same height above the water and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well
when seen through the telescope one object appeared higher than the other showing the curvature of the earth
the judge for the wager the editor of field magazine declared wallace the winner but hampden refused to accept the result
he sued wallace and launched a campaign which persisted for several years of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief
wallace won multiple libel suits against hampden but the resulting litigation cost wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years
in the early s wallace joined the debate over mandatory smallpox vaccination
wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty but after studying statistics provided by anti vaccination activists he began to question the efficacy of vaccination
at the time the germ theory of disease was new and far from universally accepted
moreover no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked
wallace discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable in a few cases completely false statistics to support their arguments
always suspicious of authority wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation
alfred r wallace from the preface of his vaccination a delusion another factor in wallaces thinking was his belief that because of the action of natural selection organisms were in a state of balance with their environment and that everything in nature served a useful purpose
wallace pointed out that vaccination which at the time was often unsanitary could be dangerous
in wallace gave evidence to a royal commission investigating the controversy
it found errors in his testimony including some questionable statistics
the lancet averred that wallace and other activists were being selective in their choice of statistics
the commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory though they recommended some changes in procedures to improve safety and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe
years later in wallace wrote a pamphlet vaccination a delusion its penal enforcement a crime attacking the commissions findings
it in turn was attacked by the lancet which stated that it repeated many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission
as a result of his writing wallace became a well known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist and was often sought out for his views
he became president of the anthropology section of the british association in and of the entomological society of london in
he was elected to the american philosophical society in
the british association elected him as head of its biology section in
he was elected to the royal society in
he was asked to chair the international congress of spiritualists meeting in london in
he received honorary doctorates and professional honours such the royal societys royal medal in and its darwin medal in and the order of merit in
wallaces fame faded quickly after his death
for a long time he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science
reasons for this lack of attention may have included his modesty his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas
the reason that the theory of evolution is popularly credited to darwin is likely the impact of darwins on the origin of species
recently wallace has become better known with the publication of at least five book length biographies and two anthologies of his writings published since
a web page dedicated to wallace scholarship is maintained at western kentucky university
in a book the environmentalist tim flannery argued that wallace was the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival and suggested that wallaces understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere should be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking
a collection of his medals including the order of merit were sold at auction for in
the natural history museum london co ordinated commemorative events for the wallace centenary worldwide in the wallace project in
on january his portrait was unveiled in the main hall of the museum by bill bailey a fervent admirer
bailey further championed wallace in his bbc two series bill baileys jungle hero
on november the th anniversary of wallaces death sir david attenborough unveiled a statue of wallace at the museum
the statue sculpted by anthony smith was donated by the a
wallace memorial fund
it depicts wallace as a young man collecting in the jungle
november marked the debut of the animated life of a
wallace a paper puppet animation film dedicated to wallaces centennial
in addition bailey unveiled a bust of wallace sculpted by felicity crawley in twyn square in usk monmouthshire in november
commemorations of the th anniversary of wallaces birth celebrated during the course of range from naturalist walk events to scientific congresses and presentations
a harvard museum of natural history event in april of will also include a mixologist designed special cocktail to honor wallaces legacy
mount wallace in californias sierra nevada mountain range was named in his honour in
in a house at richard hale school was named after wallace
the alfred russel wallace building is a prominent feature of the glyntaff campus at the university of south wales by pontypridd with several teaching spaces and laboratories for science courses
the natural sciences building at swansea university and lecture theatre at cardiff university are named after him as are impact craters on mars and the moon
in the royal entomological society mounted a year long expedition to the dumoga bone national park in north sulawesi named project wallace
a group of indonesian islands is known as the wallacea biogeographical region in his honour and operation wallacea named after the region awards alfred russel wallace grants to undergraduate ecology students
several hundred species of plants and animals both living and fossil have been named after wallace such as the gecko cyrtodactylus wallacei and the freshwater stingray potamotrygon wallacei
wallace was a prolific author
in a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of wallaces publications
he found that wallace had published full length books and at least shorter pieces of which were scientific papers
he further broke down the short pieces by their primary subjects were on biogeography and natural history were on evolutionary theory were social commentary were on anthropology and were on spiritualism and phrenology
an online bibliography of wallaces writings has more than entries
there is an extensive literature on wallace
recent books on him include the australian labor party also simply known as labor is the major centre left political party in australia one of two major parties in australian politics along with the centre right liberal party of australia
the party has been governing federally since being elected at the election and with political branches in each state and territory they are currently in government in new south wales queensland south australia victoria western australia the australian capital territory and the northern territory tasmania is the only state or territory where they currently form the opposition
it is the oldest continuous political party in australia being established on may at parliament house melbourne the meeting place of the first federal parliament
the alp was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the australian parliament in
it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various australian colonies by the emerging labour movement in australia formally beginning in
colonial labour parties contested seats from and federal seats following federation at the federal election
the alp formed the worlds first labour party government and the worlds first social democratic government at a national level
at the federal election labor was the first party in australia to win a majority in either house of the australian parliament
in every election since labor has either served as the governing party or the opposition
there have been labor prime ministers and periods of federal labor governments
at the federal and state colony level the australian labor party predates both the british labour party and the new zealand labour party in party formation government and policy implementation
internationally the alp is a member of the progressive alliance a network of social democratic parties having previously been a member of the socialist international
in standard australian english the word is spelt with a u
however the political party uses the spelling labor without a u
there was originally no standardised spelling of the partys name with labor and labour both in common usage
according to ross mcmullin who wrote an official history of the labor party the title page of the proceedings of the federal conference used the spelling labor in labour in and and then labor from onwards
in james catts put forward a motion at the federal conference that the name of the party be the australian labour party which was carried by votes to
a separate motion recommending state branches adopt the name was defeated
there was no uniformity of party names until when the federal party resolved that state branches should adopt the name australian labor party now spelt without a u
each state branch had previously used a different name due to their different origins
although the alp officially adopted the spelling without a u it took decades for the official spelling to achieve widespread acceptance
according to mcmullin the way the spelling of labor party was consolidated had more to do with the chap who ended up being in charge of printing the federal conference report than any other reason
some sources have attributed the official choice of labor to influence from king omalley who was born in the united states and was reputedly an advocate of spelling reform the spelling without a u is the standard form in american english
it has been suggested that the adoption of the spelling without a u signified one of the alps earliest attempts at modernisation and served the purpose of differentiating the party from the australian labour movement as a whole and distinguishing it from other british empire labour parties
the decision to include the word australian in the partys name rather than just labour party as in the united kingdom has been attributed to the greater importance of nationalism for the founders of the colonial parties
the australian labor party has its origins in the labour parties founded in the s in the australian colonies prior to federation
labor tradition ascribes the founding of queensland labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree in barcaldine queensland in
the shearers strike is credited as being one of the factors for the formation of the australian labor party
on september the manifesto of the queensland labour party was read out under the well known tree of knowledge at barcaldine following the great shearers strike
the state library of queensland now holds the manifesto in the historic document was added to unescos memory of the world australian register and in the document was added to unescos memory of the world international register
the balmain new south wales branch of the party claims to be the oldest in australia
however the scone branch has a receipt for membership fees for the labour electoral league dated april
this predates the balmain claim
this can be attested in the centenary of the alp book
labour as a parliamentary party dates from in new south wales and south australia in queensland and later in the other colonies
the first election contested by labour candidates was the new south wales election when labour candidates won of seats
the major parties were the protectionist and free trade parties and labour held the balance of power
it offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions
the united labor party of south australia was founded in and three candidates were that year elected to the south australian legislative council
the first successful south australian house of assembly candidate was john mcpherson at the east adelaide by election
richard hooper however was elected as an independent labor candidate at the wallaroo by election while he was the first labor member of the house of assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ulp
at the south australian elections the ulp was immediately elevated to balance of power status with of lower house seats
the liberal government of charles kingston was formed with the support of the ulp ousting the conservative government of john downer
so successful less than a decade later at the state election thomas price formed the worlds first stable labor government
john verran led labor to form the states first of many majority governments at the state election
in anderson dawson formed a minority labour government in queensland the first in the world which lasted one week while the conservatives regrouped after a split
the colonial labour parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the federation of australia
some labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution claiming that the senate as proposed was too powerful similar to the anti reformist colonial upper houses and the british house of lords
they feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces
however the first labour leader and prime minister chris watson was a supporter of federation
historian celia hamilton examining new south wales argues for the central role of irish catholics
before they opposed henry parkes the main liberal leader and of free trade seeing them both as the ideals of protestant englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests
in the strike of the leading catholic sydneys archbishop patrick francis moran was sympathetic toward unions but catholic newspapers were negative
after says hamilton irish catholics were drawn to the labour party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers
in the elections labour gained in the more catholic areas and the representation of catholics increased in labours parliamentary ranks
the federal parliament in was contested by each state labour party
in total they won of the seats in the house of representatives collectively holding the balance of power and the labour members now met as the federal parliamentary labour party on may at parliament house melbourne the meeting place of the first federal parliament
the caucus decided to support the incumbent protectionist party in minority government while the free trade party formed the opposition
it was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level
labour under chris watson doubled its vote at the federal election and continued to hold the balance of power
in april however watson and alfred deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the conciliation and arbitration bill to cover state public servants the fallout causing deakin to resign
free trade leader george reid declined to take office which saw watson become the first labour prime minister of australia and the worlds first labour head of government at a national level though his was a minority government that lasted only four months
he was aged only and is still the youngest prime minister in australias history
george reid of the free trade party adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along labour vs
non labour lines prior to the federal election and renamed his free trade party to the anti socialist party
reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti socialist with the protectionist party in the middle
this attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the westminster tradition and regarded a two party system as very much the norm
although watson further strengthened labours position in he stepped down from the leadership the following year to be succeeded by andrew fisher who formed a minority government lasting seven months from late to mid
at the federal election fisher led labor to victory forming australias first elected federal majority government australias first elected senate majority the worlds first labour party majority government at a national level and after the chris watson minority government the worlds second labour party government at a national level
it was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature
the state branches were also successful except in victoria where the strength of deakinite liberalism inhibited the partys growth
the state branches formed their first majority governments in new south wales and south australia in western australia in queensland in and tasmania in
such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years
analysis of the early nsw labor caucus reveals a band of unhappy amateurs made up of blue collar workers a squatter a doctor and even a mine owner indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed labor is untrue
in addition many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies in the first grouping of state mps of the were free traders
in the aftermath of world war i and the russian revolution of support for socialism grew in trade union ranks and at the all australian trades union congress a resolution was passed calling for the socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange
the labor party national conference adopted a similarly worded socialist objective which remained official policy for many years
the resolution was immediately qualified however by the blackburn amendment which said that socialisation was desirable only when was necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features
in practice the socialist objective was a dead letter
only once has a federal labor government attempted to nationalise any industry and that was held by the high court to be unconstitutional
the commitment to nationalisation was dropped by gough whitlam and bob hawkes government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and privatisation of state enterprises such as qantas airways and the commonwealth bank
the labor party is commonly described as a social democratic party and its constitution stipulates that it is a democratic socialist party
the party was created by and has always been influenced by the trade unions and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement
thus at the first federal election labors platform called for a white australia policy a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes
labor has at various times supported high tariffs and low tariffs conscription and pacifism white australia and multiculturalism nationalisation and privatisation isolationism and internationalism
historically labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the white australia policy which banned all non european migration to australia
this policy was partly motivated by th century theories about racial purity and by fears of economic competition from low wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of australians and all major political parties
in practice the labor party opposed all migration on the grounds that immigrants competed with australian workers and drove down wages until after world war ii when the chifley government launched a major immigration program
the partys opposition to non european immigration did not change until after the retirement of arthur calwell as leader in
subsequently labor has become an advocate of multiculturalism although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels
the curtin and chifley governments governed australia through the latter half of the second world war and initial stages of transition to peace
labor leader john curtin became prime minister in october when two independents crossed the floor of parliament
labor led by curtin then led australia through the years of the pacific war
in december curtin announced that australia looks to america free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the united kingdom thus helping to establish the australian american alliance
remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the federal election curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by ben chifley
chifley labor won the federal election and oversaw australias initial transition to a peacetime economy
labor was defeated at the federal election
at the conference of the new south wales labor party in june chifley sought to define the labour movement as follows we have a great objective the light on the hill which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind
would bring something better to the people better standards of living greater happiness to the mass of the people
to a large extent chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions
with an increasingly uncertain economic outlook after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the communist dominated miners federation chifley lost office in to robert menzies liberal national coalition
labor commenced a year period in opposition
the party was primarily led during this time by h
evatt and arthur calwell
various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the alp under gough whitlam resulting in what is now known as the socialist left who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more socially progressive ideals and labor right the now dominant faction that tends to be more economically liberal and focus to a lesser extent on social issues
the whitlam labor government marking a break with labors socialist tradition pursued social democratic policies rather than democratic socialist policies
in contrast to earlier labor leaders whitlam also cut tariffs by percent
whitlam led the federal labor party back to office at the and federal elections and passed a large amount of legislation
the whitlam government lost office following the australian constitutional crisis and dismissal by governor general john kerr after the coalition blocked supply in the senate after a series of political scandals and was defeated at the federal election in the largest landslide of australian federal history
whitlam remains the only prime minister to have his commission terminated in that manner
whitlam also lost the federal election and subsequently resigned as leader
bill hayden succeeded whitlam as leader
at the federal election the party achieved a big swing though the unevenness of the swing around the nation prevented an alp victory
in bob hawke became leader of the party after hayden resigned to avoid a leadership spill
bob hawke led labor back to office at the federal election and the party won four consecutive elections under hawke
in december paul keating defeated bob hawke in a leadership spill
the alp then won the federal election
it was in power for five terms over years until severely defeated by john howard at the federal election
this was the longest period the party has ever been in government at the national level
kim beazley led the party to the federal election winning percent of the two party preferred vote but falling short on seats and the alp lost ground at the federal election
after a brief period when simon crean served as alp leader mark latham led labor to the federal election but lost further ground
beazley replaced latham in not long afterwards he in turn was forced out of the leadership by kevin rudd
rudd went on to defeat john howard at the federal election with percent of the two party vote
the rudd government ended prior to the federal election with the overthrow of rudd as leader of the party by deputy leader julia gillard
gillard who was also the first woman to serve as prime minister of australia remained prime minister in a hung parliament following the election
her government lasted until when gillard lost a leadership spill with rudd becoming leader once again
later that year the alp lost the election
after this defeat bill shorten became leader of the party
the party narrowly lost the election yet gained seats
it remained in opposition after the election despite having been ahead in opinion polls for the preceding two years
the party lost in some of the seats which it had won back in
after the defeat shorten resigned from the leadership though he remained in parliament
anthony albanese was elected as leader unopposed and led the party to victory in the election
between the federal election and the western australian state election labor was in government nationally and in all eight state and territory legislatures
this was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the act and the nt gained self government
labor narrowly lost government in western australia at the state election and victoria at the state election
these losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in new south wales in queensland in the northern territory in federally in and tasmania in
labor secured a good result in the australian capital territory in and despite losing its majority the party retained government in south australia in
however most of these reversals proved only temporary with labor returning to government in victoria in and in queensland in after spending only one term in opposition in both states
furthermore after winning the fisher by election by nine votes from a percent swing the labor government in south australia went from minority to majority government
labor won landslide victories in the northern territory election the western australian election and the victorian state election
however labor lost the south australian state election after years in government
in labor returned to government after defeating the liberal party in the south australian state election
despite favourable polling the party also did not return to government in the new south wales state election or the federal election
the latter has been considered a historic upset due to labors consistent and significant polling lead the result has been likened to the coalitions loss in the federal election with retrospectively referred to as the unloseable election
anthony albanese later led the party into the australian federal election in which the party once again won a majority government
in labor won the new south wales state election returning to government for the first time since
this victory marked the first time in years that labor were in government in all mainland states
the policy of the australian labor party is contained in its national platform which is approved by delegates to labors national conference held every three years
according to the labor partys website the platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees local branches unions state and territory governments and individual party members
the platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal labor government
the platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future labor government would follow but does not commit the party to specific policies
it maintains that labors traditional values will remain a constant on which all australians can rely
while making it clear that labor is fully committed to a market economy it says that labor believes in a strong role for national government the one institution all australians truly own and control through our right to vote
labor will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands or located only in privileged communities
the benefits must be shared by all australians and all our regions
the platform and labor believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential
for labor government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by ensuring equal opportunity removing unjustifiable discrimination and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth income and status
further sections of the platform stress labors support for equality and human rights labour rights and democracy
in practice the platform provides only general policy guidelines to labors federal state and territory parliamentary leaderships
the policy labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the cabinet or the shadow cabinet in consultation with key interest groups within the party and is contained in the parliamentary leaders policy speech delivered during the election campaign
when labor is in office the policies it implements are determined by the cabinet subject to the platform
generally it is accepted that while the platform binds labor governments how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus
it is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the partys parliamentary leadership as well as the factions
however where there is a direct contradiction with the platform labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy
for example privatisation legislation under the hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform
the australian labor party national executive is the partys chief administrative authority subject only to labors national conference
the executive is responsible for organising the triennial national conference carrying out the decisions of the conference interpreting the national constitution the national platform and decisions of the national conference and directing federal members
the party holds a national conference every three years which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches
the national conference decides the partys platform elects the national executive and appoints office bearers such as the national secretary who also serves as national campaign director during elections
the current national secretary is paul erickson
the most recent national conference was the th conference held in december
the head office of the alp the national secretariat is managed by the national secretary
it plays a dual role of administration and a national campaign strategy
it acts as a permanent secretariat to the national executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party
as the national secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections it is also responsible for the national campaign strategy and organisation
the elected members of the labor party in both houses of the national parliament meet as the federal parliamentary labor party also known as the australian labor party caucus
besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics the caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders
until the parliamentary leaders were elected by the caucus from among its members
the leader has historically been a member of the house of representatives
since october a ballot of both the caucus and by the labor partys rank and file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader
when the labor party is in government the party leader is the prime minister and the deputy leader is the deputy prime minister
if a labor prime minister resigns or dies in office the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected
the deputy prime minister also acts as prime minister when the prime minister is on leave or out of the country
members of the ministry are also chosen by caucus though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers
anthony albanese is the leader of the federal labor party serving since may
the deputy leader is richard marles also serving since may
the australian labor party is a federal party consisting of eight branches from each state and territory
while the national executive is responsible for national campaign strategy each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal state and local elections
state and territory branches consist of both individual members and affiliated trade unions who between them decide the partys policies elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office
members join a state branch and pay a membership fee which is graduated according to income
the majority of trade unions in australia are affiliated to the party at a state level
union affiliation is direct and not through the australian council of trade unions
affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership
union affiliation fees make up a large part of the partys income
other sources of funds for the party include political donations and public funding
members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year although there are differences in the rules from state to state
in practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings
many members are only active during election campaigns
the members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences
these conferences decide policy and elect state or territory executives a state or territory president and a state or territory secretary
however act labor directly elects its president
the larger branches also have full time assistant secretaries and organisers
in the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state however under recent national reforms at least of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches
in some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates
in others it does not preferring to allow its members to run as non endorsed candidates
the process of choosing candidates is called preselection
candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories
in some they are chosen by ballots of all party members in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference in still others by a combination of these two
the country labor party commonly known as country labor was an affiliated organisation of the labor party
although not expressly defined country labor operated mainly within rural new south wales and was mainly seen as an extension of the new south wales branch that operates in rural electorates
country labor was used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas
the country labor party was registered as a separate party in new south wales and was also registered with the australian electoral commission for federal elections
it did not have the same status in other states and consequently that designation could not be used on the ballot paper
the creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the june alp state conference in new south wales
in may following labors success at the benalla by election in victoria kim beazley announced that the alp intended to register a separate country labor party with the aec this occurred in october
the country labor designation was most frequently used in new south wales
according to the alps financial statements for the financial year nsw country labor had around members but almost no assets
it recorded a severe funding shortfall at the new south wales election and had to rely on a million loan from the party proper to remain solvent
it had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources but the nsw electoral commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately
instead the party proper had to loan country labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate
the country labor party was de registered by the new south wales electoral commission in
australian young labor is the youth wing of the australian labor party where all members under age are automatically members
it is the peak youth body within the alp
former presidents of ayl have included former nsw premier bob carr federal leader of the house tony burke former special minister of state senator john faulkner former australian workers union national secretary current member for maribyrnong and former federal labor leader bill shorten as well as dozens of state ministers and mps
the current national president is jason byrne from south australia
the australian labor party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party
the national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses
examples of such groups include the labor environment action network rainbow labor labor for choice labor womens network labor for drug law reform labor for refugees labor for housing labor teachers network aboriginal labor network and recently labor enabled the action group for disability advocacy the tasmanian branch of the australian labor party recently gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference
labors constitution has long stated the australian labor party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry production distribution and exchange to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti social features in these fields
this socialist objective was introduced in but was later qualified by two further objectives maintenance of and support for a competitive non monopolistic private sector and the right to own private property
labor governments have not attempted the democratic socialisation of any industry since the s when the chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking
labors current national platform describes the party as a modern social democratic party
observers have also described it as social democratic in contrast to democratic socialism
the labor party has always had a left wing and a right wing but since the s it has been organised into formal factions to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee
the two largest factions are the labor left and the labor right led by anthony albanese and bill shorten respectively
the labor right generally supports free market policies and the us alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues whilst the labor left favours more state intervention in the economy is generally less enthusiastic about the us alliance and is often more progressive on social issues
the national factions are themselves divided into sub factions primarily state based such as centre unity in new south wales and labor forum in queensland
those factions tend to occupy social liberal and social democratic positions
some trade unions are affiliated with the labor party and are also factionally aligned
the largest unions supporting the right faction are the australian workers union the shop distributive and allied employees association and the transport workers union
important unions supporting the left include the australian manufacturing workers union united workers union the construction forestry maritime mining and energy union and the community and public sector union
preselections are usually conducted along factional lines although sometimes a non factional candidate will be given preferential treatment
deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place
preselections particularly for safe labor seats can sometimes be strongly contested
a particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of branch stacking personation multiple voting and on occasions fraudulent electoral enrolment
trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections but party rules changes have stamped out this practice
preselection results are sometimes challenged and the national executive is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes
for the financial year the top ten disclosed donors to the alp were the health services union nsw village roadshow electrical trades union of australia national automotive leasing and salary packaging association westfield corporation randazzo cg developments macquarie telecom woodside energy anz bank and ying zhou all significantly lower than the donations by a chinese donor zi chun wang which at was the largest donation to any political party in the financial year
at least one newspaper report queried the identity of this donor stating news archive searches do not produce results for this name suggesting wang operates under another name
another report mentions that in addition to a hotel and a travel agency the donors listed address at the old communist cadres activity centre in shijiazhuang houses several chinese government entities stating also that another publisher tried many times without success to contact the donor on the phone number listed in the donation return form
the labor party also receives undisclosed funding through several methods such as associated entities
john curtin house industry ir and the happy wanderers club are entities which have been used to funnel donations to the labor party without disclosing the source
a report found that the labor party received from pro gun groups during the periods however the coalition received over in donations from pro gun groups more than doubling labors pro gun donors

isbn the dodo is a fictional character appearing in chapters and of the book alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll
the dodo is a caricature of the author
a popular but unsubstantiated belief is that dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer and thus would accidentally introduce himself as do do dodgson
historically the dodo was a non flying bird that lived on the island of mauritius east of madagascar in the indian ocean
it became extinct in the mid th century during the colonisation of the island by the dutch
in this passage lewis carroll incorporated references to the original boating expedition of july during which alices adventures were first told with alice as herself and the others represented by birds the lory was lorina liddell the eaglet was edith liddell the dodo was dodgson and the duck was rev
robinson duckworth
in order to get dry after a swim the dodo proposes that everyone run a caucus race where the participants run in patterns of any shape starting and leaving off whenever they like so that everyone wins
at the end of the race alice distributes comfits from her pocket to all as prizes
however this leaves no prize for herself
the dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket
as she has only a thimble the dodo requests it from her and then awards it to alice as her prize
the caucus race as depicted by carroll is a satire on the political caucus system mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness
in the disney film the dodo plays a much greater role in the story
he is merged with the character of pat the gardener which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed pat the dodo but this name is never mentioned in the film
the dodo is also the leader of the caucus race
he has the appearance and personality of a sea captain
the dodo is voiced by bill thompson and animated by milt kahl
dodo is first seen as alice is floating on the sea in a bottle
dodo is seen singing but when alice asks him for help he does not notice her
on shore dodo is seen on a rock organizing a caucus race
this race involves running around until one gets dry but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves
dodo is later summoned by the white rabbit when the rabbit believes a monster actually alice having magically grown to a giant size is inside his home
dodo brings bill the lizard and attempts to get him to go down the chimney
bill refuses at first but dodo is able to convince him otherwise
however the soot causes alice to sneeze sending bill high up into the sky
dodo then decides to burn the house down much to the chagrin of the white rabbit
he begins gathering wood such as the furniture for this purpose
however alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house
the white rabbit soon leaves while dodo asks for matches not realizing that the situation has been resolved
he then asks alice for a match but when she doesnt have any dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire
the dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film conducting another caucus race
in alices wonderland bakery dodo has returned and has a son named jojo
in tim burtons adaptation of alice in wonderland the dodos appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from john tenniels illustration
he bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a navy blue waistcoat and white spats along with glasses and a cane
he is one of alices good willed advisers taking first note of her abilities as the true alice
he is also one of the oldest inhabitants
his name is uilleam and he is portrayed by michael gough
he goes with the white rabbit tweedledum and tweedledee and dormouse to take alice to caterpillar to decide whether alice is the real one
he is later captured by the red queens forces
when alice came to the red queens castle he was seen at the red queens castle yard as a caddy for the queens croquet game
after the red queen orders the release of the jubjub bird to kill all her subjects from rebelling he is then seen briefly running from it when the tweedles went to hide from it and escaped but was snatched by the jubjub and was never seen again throughout the film
his name may be based on a lecture on william the conqueror from chapter three of the original novel
the character is voiced by michael gough in his final feature film role before his death in
gough came out of retirement to appear in the film but the character only speaks three lines so gough managed to record in one day
a lory is a small to medium sized arboreal parrot
albert ii was the margrave of brandenburg kulmbach from to
he was a member of the franconian branch of the house of hohenzollern
because of his bellicose nature albert was given the cognomen bellator during his lifetime
posthumously he became known as alcibiades
albert was born in ansbach and losing his father casimir in he came under the guardianship of his uncle george margrave of brandenburg ansbach a strong adherent of protestantism
in he received bayreuth as his share of the family lands but as the chief town of his principality was kulmbach he is sometimes referred to as the margrave of brandenburg kulmbach
his restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career and having collected a small band of soldiers he assisted emperor charles v in his war with france in
the peace of crpy in september deprived him of this employment but he won a considerable reputation and when charles was preparing to attack the schmalkaldic league he took pains to win alberts assistance
sharing in the attack on the electorate of saxony albert was taken prisoner at rochlitz in march by elector john frederick of saxony but was released as a result of the emperors victory at the battle of mhlberg in the succeeding april
he then followed the fortunes of his friend elector maurice of saxony deserted charles and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the emperor by an alliance with king henry ii of france
he took part in the subsequent campaign but when the peace of passau was signed in august he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in franconia which led to the second margrave war
having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of nuremberg he quarrelled with his supporter the french king and offered his services to the emperor
charles anxious to secure such a famous fighter gladly assented to alberts demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of wrzburg and bamberg and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the emperor on the retreat from the siege of metz in january
when charles left germany a few weeks later albert renewed his depredations in franconia
these soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him and maurice of saxony led an army against his former comrade
the rival forces met at sievershausen on july and after a combat of unusual ferocity albert was put to flight
henry duke of brunswick wolfenbttel then took command of the troops of the league and after albert had been placed under the imperial ban in december he was defeated by duke henry and compelled to flee to france
he there entered the service of henry ii of france and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at pforzheim on january
he is defined by thomas carlyle as a failure of a fritz with features of a frederick the great in him but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors and never came to anything full of fire too much of it wildfire not in the least like an alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent
he had early two children frederick and anna
he was buried at heilsbronn mnster
his hymn was mein got will das gscheh allzeit was translated as the will of god is always best
albert the bear was the first margrave of brandenburg from to his death and was briefly duke of saxony between and
albert was the only son of otto count of ballenstedt and eilika daughter of magnus billung duke of saxony
he inherited his fathers valuable estates in northern saxony in and on his mothers death in succeeded to one half of the lands of the house of billung
albert was a loyal vassal of his relation lothar i duke of saxony from whom about he received the margraviate of lusatia to the east after lothar became king of the germans he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to bohemia against the upstart sobslav i duke of bohemia in at the battle of kulm where he suffered a short imprisonment
alberts entanglements in saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there
after the death of his brother in law henry ii margrave of the nordmark who controlled a small area on the elbe called the saxon northern march in albert disappointed at not receiving this fief himself attacked udo v count of stade the heir and was consequently deprived of lusatia by lothar
udo however was said to have been assassinated by servants of albert on march near aschersleben
in spite of this albert went to italy in in the train of the king and his services there were rewarded in by the investiture of the northern march which was again without a ruler
in conrad iii the hohenstaufen king of the germans deprived alberts cousin and nemesis henry the proud of his saxon duchy which was awarded to albert if he could take it
after some initial success in his efforts to take possession albert was driven from saxony and also from his northern march by a combined force of henry and jaxa of kpenick and compelled to take refuge in south germany
henry died in and an arrangement was found
henrys son henry the lion received the duchy of saxony in
in the same year albert renounced the saxon duchy and received the counties of weimar and orlamnde
once he was firmly established in the northern march alberts covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east
for three years he was occupied in campaigns against the slavic wends who as pagans were considered fair game and whose subjugation to christianity was the aim of the wendish crusade of in which albert took part
albert was a part of the army that besieged demmin and at the end of the war recovered havelberg which had been lost since
diplomatic measures were more successful and by an arrangement made with the last of the wendish princes of brandenburg pribislav henry of the hevelli albert secured this district when the prince died in
taking the title margrave in brandenburg he pressed the crusade against the wends extended the area of his mark encouraged dutch and german settlement in the elbe havel region established bishoprics under his protection and so became the founder of the margraviate of brandenburg in which his heirs the house of ascania held until the line died out in
in a feud with henry the lion duke of saxony was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the holy land
on his return in he with the consent of his sons siegfried not being mentioned donated land to the knights of saint john in memory of his wife sofia at werben on the elbe
around this same time he minted a pfennig in memory of his deceased wife
in albert accompanied emperor frederick barbarossa to italy where he distinguished himself at the storming of milan
in albert joined a league of princes formed against henry the lion and peace being made in albert divided his territories among his six sons
he died on november and was buried at ballenstedt
alberts personal qualities won for him the cognomen of the bear not from his looks or qualities for he was a tall handsome man but from the cognisance on his shield an able man had a quick eye as well as a strong hand and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things was the shining figure and the great man of the north in his day got much in the north and kept it got brandenburg for one there a conspicuous country ever since says thomas carlyle who called albert a restless much managing wide warring man
he was also called the handsome
cardinal albert of brandenburg was a german cardinal elector archbishop of mainz from to and archbishop of magdeburg from to
through his notorious sale of indulgences he became the catalyst for martin luthers reformation and its staunch opponent
born in clln on the spree now a central part of berlin into the ruling house of hohenzollern albert was the younger son of john cicero elector of brandenburg and margaret of thuringia
after their fathers death in alberts older brother joachim i nestor became elector of brandenburg while albert held only the title of a margrave of brandenburg
albert studied at the university of frankfurt and in became archbishop of magdeburg at the age of and administrator of the diocese of halberstadt
in he was also elected archbishop of mainz and thus sovereign of the electorate of mainz and archchancellor of the holy roman empire
by electing him the mainz cathedral chapter hoped for the support of the elector of brandenburg in defending the city of erfurt which belonged to the archbishopric of mainz against the expansionist efforts of the neighboring saxon dukes
however this choice violated the canonical prohibition to hold more than one bishopric
albert also did not meet the requirements for taking over any diocese since he had not yet reached the age and he didnt have a college degree therefore he received a study dispensation in
albert borrowed guilders from jacob fugger to pay the confirmation fee to the roman curia
in albert suggested to pope leo x that a special indulgence be announced in his three dioceses as well as in his native diocese of brandenburg and that half of the income should be used for the construction of the new st
peters basilica and half for alberts own cash register
the papal bull was issued on march
the indulgence was entrusted to albert in for publication in saxony and brandenburg
it cost him the considerable sum of ten thousand ducats and albert employed johann tetzel for the actual preaching of the indulgence
later martin luther addressed a letter of protest to albert concerning the conduct of tetzel
largely in reaction to tetzels actions luther wrote his famous ninety five theses which led to the reformation
luther sent these to albert on october and according to a disputable tradition nailed a copy to the door of castle church in wittenberg
albert forwarded the theses to rome suspecting luther of heresy
as archbishop of mainz he tried unsuccessfully in and to expel the jews living in mainz
in at the age of he was made a cardinal
when the imperial election of drew near partisans of the two leading candidates eagerly solicited the vote of the prince archbishop of mainz and albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote
the electors eventually chose charles who became the emperor charles v
like other high ranking clergymen of his time archbishop albert lived in concubinage gave his lovers gifts and favored his children as far as possible without causing much offense
recent research assumes that he lived in a marriage like relationship at first with elisabeth leys schtz from mainz and then with the frankfurt widow agnes pless ne strauss
with leys schtz he had a daughter named anna whom he married to his secretary joachim kirchner
alberts large and liberal ideas his correspondence with leading humanists his friendship with ulrich von hutten whom he drew to his court and his political ambitions appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to protestantism but after the german peasants war of he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of catholicism and was among the princes who joined the league of dessau in july
from until his flight on february albert ruled mostly from his residence moritzburg in halle
in he had a spacious new residential palace built there
albert also needed a prestigious church that met his expectations at a central location in his residenz town
he feared for his peace of mind in heaven and collected more than relics and holy skeletons which needed to be stored
from he had two parish churches standing next to each other demolished and only their four towers from around with pointed helmets stood
between these towers he had a large new nave built which was named market church of our lady since she received a marian patronage
however these precious treasures known as hallesches heilthum indirectly related to the sale of indulgences which had triggered the reformation a few years before because it should attract pilgrims willing to pay
then the cardinal and the catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of the reformation by holding far grander masses and services in a new church dedicated solely to the blessed virgin mary whose excessive worship luther disliked
alberts hostility towards the reformers however was not so extreme as that of his brother joachim i and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace although he was a member of the league of nuremberg formed in as a counterpoise to the league of schmalkalden
new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of magdeburg in return for florins
during his later years he showed more intolerance towards the protestants and favoured the teaching of the jesuits in his dominions
the market church of our lady in halle which had been built to defend against the spread of reformation sympathies was the spot where justus jonas officially introduced the reformation into halle with his good friday sermon in
the service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave
jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed
albert left the town permanently after the estates in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of jakob fugger
halle became protestant and in jonas was appointed as priest to st
marys and in bishop over the city
he became a friend of science and a patron of the arts
as a patron of learning he counted erasmus among his friends
however alberts ideas about founding a catholic university in halle were not implemented
nonetheless he adorned halle cathedral and mainz cathedral in sumptuous fashion and took as his motto the words

albert of prussia was a german prince who was the th grand master of the teutonic knights and after converting to lutheranism became the first ruler of the duchy of prussia the secularized state that emerged from the former monastic state of the teutonic knights
albert was the first european ruler to establish lutheranism and thus protestantism as the official state religion of his lands
he proved instrumental in the political spread of protestantism in its early stage ruling the prussian lands for nearly six decades
a member of the brandenburg ansbach branch of the house of hohenzollern albert became grand master where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the teutonic order
but albert who was sympathetic to the demands of martin luther rebelled against the roman catholic church and the holy roman empire by converting the teutonic state into a protestant and hereditary realm the duchy of prussia for which he paid homage to his uncle sigismund i king of poland
that arrangement was confirmed by the treaty of krakw in
albert pledged a personal oath to the king and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs
alberts rule in prussia was fairly prosperous
although he had some trouble with the peasantry the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the catholic church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established prussian court
he was active in imperial politics joining the league of torgau in and acted in unison with the protestants in plotting to overthrow emperor charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may
albert established schools in every town and founded the university of knigsberg in
he promoted culture and arts patronising the works of erasmus reinhold and caspar hennenberger
during the final years of his rule albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now depleted church lands causing peasant rebellion
the intrigues of the court favourites johann funck and paul skali also led to various religious and political disputes
albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at tapiau on march
his son albert frederick succeeded him as duke of prussia
albert was born in ansbach in franconia as the third son of frederick i margrave of brandenburg ansbach
his mother was sophia daughter of casimir iv jagiellon grand duke of lithuania and king of poland and his wife elisabeth of austria
he was raised for a career in the church and spent some time at the court of hermann iv of hesse elector of cologne who appointed him canon of the cologne cathedral
not only was he quite religious he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the church in favour of scientific theories
his career was forwarded by the church however and institutions of the catholic clerics supported his early advancement
turning to a more active life albert accompanied emperor maximilian i to italy in and after his return spent some time in the kingdom of hungary
duke frederick of saxony grand master of the teutonic order died in december
albert was chosen as his successor early in in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle sigismund i the old grand duke of lithuania and king of poland would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern prussia which had been held by the order under polish suzerainty since the second peace of thorn
the new grand master aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy refused to submit to the crown of poland
as war over the orders existence appeared inevitable albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with emperor maximilian i
the ill feeling influenced by the ravages of members of the order in poland culminated in a war which began in december and devastated prussia
albert was granted a four year truce early in
the dispute was referred to emperor charles v and other princes but as no settlement was reached albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war
for this purpose he visited the diet of nuremberg in where he made the acquaintance of the reformer andreas osiander by whose influence albert was won over to protestantism
the grand master then journeyed to wittenberg where he was advised by martin luther to abandon the rules of his order to marry and to convert prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself
this proposal which was understandably appealing to albert had already been discussed by some of his relatives but it was necessary to proceed cautiously and he assured pope adrian vi that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted lutheran doctrines
luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the prussians while alberts brother margrave george of brandenburg ansbach laid the scheme before their uncle sigismund i the old of poland
after some delay sigismund assented to the offer with the provision that prussia should be treated as a polish fiefdom and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a treaty concluded at krakw albert pledged a personal oath to sigismund i and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on february
the estates of the land then met at knigsberg and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of luther
this transition did not however take place without protest
summoned before the imperial court of justice albert refused to appear and was proscribed while the order elected a new grand master walter von cronberg who received prussia as a fief at the imperial diet of augsburg
as the german princes were experiencing the tumult of the reformation the german peasants war and the wars against the ottoman turks they did not enforce the ban on the duke and agitation against him soon died away
in imperial politics albert was fairly active
joining the league of torgau in he acted in unison with the protestants and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow charles v after the issue of the augsburg interim in may
for various reasons however poverty and personal inclination among others he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period
the early years of alberts rule in prussia were fairly prosperous
although he had some trouble with the peasantry the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court
he did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life
in in spite of some opposition he founded knigsberg university where he appointed his friend andreas osiander to a professorship in
albert also paid for the printing of the astronomical prutenic tables compiled by erasmus reinhold and the first maps of prussia by caspar hennenberger
osianders appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of alberts reign
osianders divergence from luthers doctrine of justification by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with philip melanchthon who had adherents in knigsberg and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town
the duke strenuously supported osiander and the area of the quarrel soon broadened
there were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles the burden of taxation was heavy and alberts rule became unpopular
after osianders death in albert favoured a preacher named johann funck who with an adventurer named paul skali exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense
the state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of alberts early death and the need should that happen to appoint a regent as his only son albert frederick was still a mere youth
the duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of osiander and the climax came in when the estates appealed to king sigismund ii augustus of poland alberts cousin who sent a commission to knigsberg
skali saved his life by flight but funck was executed
the question of the regency was settled and a form of lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers
virtually deprived of power the duke lived for two more years and died at tapiau on march of the plague along with his wife
cornelis floris de vriendt designed his tomb within knigsberg cathedral
albert was a voluminous letter writer and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time
albert was the first german noble to support luthers ideas and in founded the university of knigsberg the albertina as a rival to the roman catholic krakow academy
it was the second lutheran university in the german states after the university of marburg
a relief of albert over the renaissance era portal of knigsberg castles southern wing was created by andreas hess in according to plans by christoph rmer
another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the albertinas original campus
this depiction which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder was the popular albertus the symbol of the university
the original was moved to knigsberg public library to protect it from the elements while the sculptor paul kimritz created a duplicate for the wall
another version of the albertus by lothar sauer was included at the entrance of the knigsberg state and royal library
in friedrich reusch created a sandstone bust of albert at the regierungsgebude the administrative building for regierungsbezirk knigsberg

flint quarries on the lousberg schneeberg and knigshgel first used during neolithic times attest to the long occupation of the site of aachen as do recent finds under the modern citys elisengarten pointing to a former settlement from the same period
bronze age settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows found for example on the klausberg
during the iron age the area was settled by celtic peoples who were perhaps drawn by the marshy aachen basins hot sulphur springs where they worshipped grannus god of light and healing
later the hectare roman spa resort town of aquae granni was according to legend founded by grenus under hadrian around ad
instead the fictitious founder refers to the celtic god and it seems it was the roman th legion at the start of the st century ad that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at bchel adding at the end of the same century the mnstertherme spa two water pipelines and a probable sanctuary dedicated to grannus
a kind of forum surrounded by colonnades connected the two spa complexes
there was also an extensive residential area
the romans built bathhouses near burtscheid
a temple precinct called vernenum was built near the modern kornelimnster walheim
today remains have been found of three bathhouses including two fountains in the elisenbrunnen and the burtscheid bathhouse

as the westernmost city in germany aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a temperate climate zone with humid weather mild winters and warm summers
because of its location north of the eifel and the high fens and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns rainfall in aachen is comparatively higher than for example in bonn

the geology of aachen is very structurally heterogeneous
the oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the devonian period and include carboniferous sandstone greywacke claystone and limestone
these formations are part of the rhenish massif north of the high fens
in the pennsylvanian subperiod of the carboniferous geological period these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the variscan orogeny
after this event and over the course of the following million years this area has been continuously flattened
during the cretaceous period the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the north sea up to the mountainous area near aachen bringing with it clay sand and chalk deposits
while the clay is mostly found in the lower areas of aachen the hills of the aachen forest and the lousberg were formed from upper cretaceous sand and chalk deposits
more recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of aachen and was formed through tertiary and quaternary river and wind activities
along the major thrust fault of the variscan orogeny there are over thermal springs in aachen and burtscheid

it was originally built in the carolingian style including marble covered walls and mosaic inlay on the dome
on his death charlemagnes remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day
the cathedral was extended several times in later ages turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles

most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from rome and ravenna including the sarcophagus in which charlemagne was eventually laid to rest
a bronze bear from gaul was placed inside along with an equestrian statue from ravenna believed to be theodric in contrast to a wolf and a statue of marcus aurelius in the capitoline
bronze pieces such as the doors and railings some of which have survived to present day were cast in a local foundry

wherever it was made it was also a parallel to a piece in rome this in old st
peters basilica
aachen cathedral treasury has housed throughout its history a collection of liturgical objects
the origin of this church treasure is in dispute as some say charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection while the rest were collected over time
others say all of the objects were collected over time from such places as jerusalem and constantinople
the location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the th century when it was located in the matthiaskapelle until when it was moved to the karlskapelle
from there it was moved to the hungarian chapel in and in to its present location next to the allerseelenkapelle
only six of the original carolingian objects have remained and of those only three are left in aachen the aachen gospels a diptych of christ and an early byzantine silk
the coronation gospels and a reliquary burse of st
stephen were moved to vienna in and the talisman of charlemagne was given as a gift in to josephine bonaparte and subsequently to rheims cathedral
documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of charlemagne

agate is the banded variety of chalcedony which comes in a wide variety of colors
agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks
the ornamental use of agate was common in ancient greece in assorted jewelry and in the seal stones of greek warriors while bead necklaces with pierced and polished agate date back to the rd millennium bce in the indus valley civilisation
the stone was given its name by theophrastus a greek philosopher and naturalist who discovered the stone along the shore line of the dirillo river or achates in sicily sometime between the th and rd centuries bce
agate minerals have the tendency to form on or within pre existing rocks creating difficulties in accurately determining their time of formation
their host rocks have been dated to have formed as early as the archean eon
agates are most commonly found as nodules within the cavities of volcanic rocks
these cavities are formed from the gases trapped within the liquid volcanic material forming vesicles
cavities are then filled in with silica rich fluids from the volcanic material layers are deposited on the walls of the cavity slowly working their way inwards
the first layer deposited on the cavity walls is commonly known as the priming layer
variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers
these variations in layers result in bands of chalcedony often alternating with layers of crystalline quartz forming banded agate
hollow agates can also form due to the deposition of liquid rich silica not penetrating deep enough to fill the cavity completely
agate will form crystals within the reduced cavity and the apex of each crystal may point towards the center of the cavity
the priming layer is often dark green but can be modified by iron oxide resulting in a rust like appearance
agate is very durable and is often found detached from its host matrix which has eroded away
once removed the outer surface is usually pitted and rough from filling the cavity of its former matrix
agates have also been found in sedimentary rocks normally in limestone or dolomite these sedimentary rocks acquire cavities often from decomposed branches or other buried organic material
if silica rich fluids are able to penetrate into these cavities agates can be formed
lace agate is a variety that exhibits a lace like pattern with forms such as eyes swirls bands or zigzags
blue lace agate is found in africa and is especially hard
crazy lace agate typically found in mexico is often brightly colored with a complex pattern demonstrating randomized distribution of contour lines and circular droplets scattered throughout the rock
the stone is typically coloured red and white but is also seen to exhibit yellow and grey combinations as well
moss agate as the name suggests exhibits a moss like pattern and is of a greenish colour
the coloration is not created by any vegetative growth but rather through the mixture of chalcedony and oxidized iron hornblende
dendritic agate also displays vegetative features including fern like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides
turritella agate is formed from the shells of fossilized freshwater turritella gastropods with elongated spiral shells
similarly coral petrified wood porous rocks and other organic remains can also form agate
coldwater agates such as the lake michigan cloud agate did not form under volcanic processes but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin
like volcanic origin agates coldwater agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock
these agates are typically less colorful with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony
greek agate is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in the former greek colony of sicily as early as bce
the greeks used it for making jewelry and beads
brazilian agate is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules
these occur in brownish tones inter layered with white and gray
it is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes
polyhedroid agate forms in a flat sided shape similar to a polyhedron
when sliced it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric polygons
it has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling in of spaces between pre existing crystals which have since dissolved
iris agate is a finely banded and usually colorless agate that when thinly sliced exhibits spectral decomposition of white light into its constituent colors requiring to up to bands per inch
other forms of agate include holley blue agate a rare dark blue ribbon agate found only near holley oregon lake superior agate carnelian agate botswana agate plume agate condor agate tube agate containing visible flow channels or pinhole sized tubes fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts binghamite a variety found only on the cuyuna iron range in crow wing county minnesota fire agate showing an iridescent internal flash or fire the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite patuxent river stone a red and yellow form of agate only found in maryland and enhydro agate which contains tiny inclusions of water sometimes with air bubbles
agate is a versatile gemstone that is often used in jewelry making
agate is favored for its durability with a mohs scale hardness rating of
it is known for its colorful banded patterns and wide range of hues
agate is found in a wide range of colors including shades of red orange yellow green blue purple and pink as well as black and white
agate is generally more affordable than other gemstones
agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of hardstone carving and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites indicating its widespread use in the ancient world for example archaeological recovery at the knossos site on crete illustrates its role in bronze age minoan culture
it has also been used for centuries for leather burnishing tools
the decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as pins brooches or other types of jewellery paper knives inkstands marbles and seals
agate is also still used today for decorative displays cabochons beads carvings and intarsia art as well as face polished and tumble polished specimens of varying size and origin
idar oberstein was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale
where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the european market this became a globalized business around the turn of the th century idar oberstein imported large quantities of agate from brazil as ships ballast
making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe
agates have long been used in arts and crafts
the sanctuary of a presbyterian church in yachats oregon has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches
industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack
it has traditionally been used to make knife edge bearings for laboratory balances and precision pendulums and sometimes to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals
respiratory diseases such as silicosis and a higher incidence of tuberculosis among workers involved in the agate industry have been studied in india and china
aspirin also known as acetylsalicylic acid is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug used to reduce pain fever and or inflammation and as an antithrombotic
specific inflammatory conditions which aspirin is used to treat include kawasaki disease pericarditis and rheumatic fever
aspirin is also used long term to help prevent further heart attacks ischaemic strokes and blood clots in people at high risk
for pain or fever effects typically begin within minutes
aspirin works similarly to other nsaids but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets
one common adverse effect is an upset stomach
more significant side effects include stomach ulcers stomach bleeding and worsening asthma
bleeding risk is greater among those who are older drink alcohol take other nsaids or are on other blood thinners
aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy
it is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of reye syndrome
high doses may result in ringing in the ears
a precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree has been used for its health effects for at least years
in chemist charles frdric gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time
over the next years other chemists established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods
aspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions
it is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated consumed each year and is on the world health organizations list of essential medicines
in it was the th most commonly prescribed medication in the united states with more than million prescriptions
in scientists at the bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines
by bayer had named it aspirin and sold it around the world
aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to competition between many brands and formulations
the word aspirin was bayers brand name however their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries
the name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a spir spiraea the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at bayer in the common chemical suffix
aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates carbonates citrates or hydroxides of the alkali metals
it is stable in dry air but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids
in solution with alkalis the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate
like flour mills factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building because the powder air mixture can be explosive
the national institute for occupational safety and health has set a recommended exposure limit in the united states of mg m
in the occupational safety and health administration set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of mg m but this was vacated by the afl cio v
osha decision in
the synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction
salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride an acid derivative causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acids hydroxyl group into an ester group
this process yields aspirin and acetic acid which is considered a byproduct of this reaction
small amounts of sulfuric acid are almost always used as a catalyst
this method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs
formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions yielding salicylic and acetic acids
aspirin an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid is a white crystalline weakly acidic substance which melts at and decomposes around
its acid dissociation constant is at
polymorphism or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients
many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph
there was only one proven polymorph form i of aspirin though the existence of another polymorph was debated since the s and one report from reported that when crystalized in the presence of aspirin anhydride the diffractogram of aspirin has weak additional peaks
though at the time it was dismissed as mere impurity it was in retrospect form ii aspirin
form ii was reported in found after attempted co crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile
in form i pairs of aspirin molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds
in form ii each aspirin molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds but with two neighbouring molecules instead of one
with respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups both polymorphs form identical dimer structures
the aspirin polymorphs contain identical dimensional sections and are therefore more precisely described as polytypes
pure form ii aspirin could be prepared by seeding the batch with aspirin anhydrate in weight
in british pharmacologist john robert vane then employed by the royal college of surgeons in london showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes
for this discovery he was awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine jointly with sune bergstrm and bengt ingemar samuelsson
aspirins ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis
aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme
this makes aspirin different from other nsaids which are reversible inhibitors
low dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a in platelets producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet
this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack unstable angina ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack
mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a release provoked acutely with the prostaglandin i synthesis being little affected however higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition
prostaglandins local hormones produced in the body have diverse effects including the transmission of pain information to the brain modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat and inflammation
thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots
heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction
at least two different types of cyclooxygenases cox and cox are acted on by aspirin
aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox
cox normally produces prostanoids most of which are proinflammatory
aspirin modified ptgs produces lipoxins most of which are anti inflammatory
newer nsaid drugs cox inhibitors have been developed to inhibit only ptgs with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects
several cox inhibitors such as rofecoxib have been withdrawn from the market after evidence emerged that ptgs inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express ptgs and by selectively inhibiting ptgs prostaglandin production is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels as ptgs in platelets is unaffected
thus the protective anticoagulative effect of pgi is removed increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems
since platelets have no dna they are unable to synthesize new ptgs once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors
furthermore aspirin while inhibiting the ability of cox to form pro inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins converts this enzymes activity from a prostaglandin forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase like enzyme aspirin treated cox metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin triggered lipoxins aspirin triggered resolvins and aspirin triggered maresins
these mediators possess potent anti inflammatory activity
it is proposed that this aspirin triggered transition of cox from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin
aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action
it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous mitochondria by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix where it ionizes once again to release protons
aspirin buffers and transports the protons
when high doses are given it may actually cause fever owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses
in addition aspirin induces the formation of no radicals in the body which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation
this reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection however evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection
more recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through nf b
nf b a transcription factor complex plays a central role in many biological processes including inflammation
aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid which itself has anti inflammatory antipyretic and analgesic effects
in salicylic acid was found to activate amp activated protein kinase which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin
the acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets
acetylation of cellular proteins is a well established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post translational level
aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to cox isoenzymes
these acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin
aspirin is produced in many formulations with some differences in effect
in particular aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding
formulations may be combined
acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration
acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach
the increased ph and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there as more of it is ionized
owing to the formation of concretions aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to hours after ingestion
about of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin while the rest remains in the active ionized state protein binding is concentration dependent
saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity
the volume of distribution is l kg
acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates
as much as of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver
conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters
the conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide
these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity
small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid
with large salicylate doses the kinetics switch from first order to zero order as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important
salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid free salicylic acid salicylic phenol and acyl glucuronides gentisic acid and dihydroxybenzoic acid
when small doses are ingested all pathways proceed by first order kinetics with an elimination half life of about h to h
when higher doses of salicylate are ingested the half life becomes much longer because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated
renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary ph
a to fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine ph is increased from to
the use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination
it was found that short term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis
aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated
medicines made from willow and other salicylate rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient sumer as well as the ebers papyrus from ancient egypt
hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around bc and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of western medicine in classical antiquity and the middle ages
willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever pain and inflammation in the mid eighteenth century
by the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid the active component of willow extract
in chemist charles frdric gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time in the second half of the th century other academic chemists established the compounds chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis
in scientists at the drug and dye firm bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines and identified a new way to synthesize it
by bayer had dubbed this drug aspirin and was selling it globally
the word aspirin was bayers brand name rather than the generic name of the drug however bayers rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries
aspirins popularity grew over the first half of the th century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products
aspirins popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen paracetamol in and ibuprofen in
in the s and s john vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirins effects while clinical trials and other studies from the s to the s established aspirins efficacy as an anti clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases
the initial large studies on the use of low dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the s and s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and us federal law and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women
aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the th century and remain strong in the st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes
bayer lost its trademark for aspirin in the united states in actions taken between and because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of aspirin by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights
today aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries
aspirin with a capital a remains a registered trademark of bayer in germany canada mexico and in over other countries for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets but using different packaging and physical aspects for each
aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions including fever pain rheumatic fever and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis pericarditis and kawasaki disease
lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy
there is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear
in the united states the selective initiation of low dose aspirin based on an individualised assessment has been deemed reasonable for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people aged between and who have a or greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease over the next years and are not at an increased risk of bleeding
aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding
aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps bloating gastric distension or acute skin irritation
as with other nsaids combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone
effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines
topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain
aspirin either by itself or in a combined formulation effectively treats certain types of a headache but its efficacy may be questionable for others
secondary headaches meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma should be promptly treated by a medical provider
among primary headaches the international classification of headache disorders distinguishes between tension headache migraine and cluster headache
aspirin or other over the counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches
aspirin especially as a component of an aspirin paracetamol caffeine combination is considered a first line therapy in the treatment of migraine and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan
it is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning
like its ability to control pain aspirins ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of cox
although aspirins use as an antipyretic in adults is well established many medical societies and regulatory agencies including the american academy of family physicians the american academy of pediatrics and the food and drug administration strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of reyes syndrome a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection
because of the risk of reyes syndrome in children in the us food and drug administration required labeling on all aspirin containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers
aspirin is used as an anti inflammatory agent for both acute and long term inflammation as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack
it is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems including those over the age of
the antithrombotic trialists collaboration published in lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention
in those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction daily low dose aspirin was associated with a relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events
this did come at the expense of a absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding however the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case
data from previous trials have suggested that weight based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes
however more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight in specific subset of population studied ie elderly and diabetic population and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight
after percutaneous coronary interventions such as the placement of a coronary artery stent a us agency for healthcare research and quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely
frequently aspirin is combined with an adp receptor inhibitor such as clopidogrel prasugrel or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots
this is called dual antiplatelet therapy
duration of dapt was advised in the united states and european union guidelines after the cure and prodigy studies
in the systematic review and network meta analysis from khan et al
showed promising benefits of short term dapt followed by py inhibitors in selected patients as well as the benefits of extended term dapt in high risk patients
in conclusion the optimal duration of dapt after pcis should be personalized after outweighing each patients risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient related and procedure related factors
moreover aspirin should be continued indefinitely after dapt is complete
the status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies
the ascend study demonstrated that in high bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease there is no overall clinical benefit of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of years
similarly the results of the arrive study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years
aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease
complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance
for people who are resistant aspirins efficacy is reduced
some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin
as of the united states preventive services task force determined that there was a small net benefit for patients aged with a or greater year cardiovascular disease risk and no net benefit for patients aged over
determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes
their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age while the risk of bleeding while small increases with age particular for adults over and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding
as a result the uspstf suggests that people ages to who are at higher risk for cvd should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin people or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke
primary prevention guidelines from made by the american college of cardiology and the american heart association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged with a higher risk of atherosclerotic cvd without an increased bleeding risk while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk
they state a cvd risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin while stating aspirin should be used infrequently in the routine primary prevention of because of lack of net benefit
as of the european society of cardiology made similar recommendations considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than at high or very high cvd risk without any clear contraindications on a case by case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk
aspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer
there is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer but aspirin must be taken for at least years to see this benefit
it may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer
some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk
others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk
given this uncertainty the united states preventive services task force guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of crc in people with average risk
nine years later however the uspstf issued a grade b recommendation for the use of low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cvd disease and crc in adults to years of age who have a or greater year cvd risk are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least years and are willing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least years
a meta analysis through said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum esophagus and stomach
in the us preventive services task force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention
it notes the results of the aspree trial in which the risk of cancer related death was higher in the aspirin treated group than in the placebo group
aspirin along with several other agents with anti inflammatory properties has been repurposed as an add on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders
a systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies
however further high quality longer duration double blind randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add on treatment for bipolar depression
thus notwithstanding the biological rationale the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain
although cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this
some researchers have speculated the anti inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia
small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking
aspirin is a first line treatment for the fever and joint pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever
the therapy often lasts for one to two weeks and is rarely indicated for longer periods
after fever and pain have subsided the aspirin is no longer necessary since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease
naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic but due to the limited clinical experience naproxen is recommended only as a second line treatment
along with rheumatic fever kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness
low dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre eclampsia
this benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy
aspirin has also demonstrated anti tumoral effects via inhibition of the pttg gene which is often overexpressed in tumors
for some people aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity
one study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men and a different aggregate study of people found were resistant
a study in italian people found of the apparent aspirin resistant subjects only were truly resistant and the others were noncompliant
another study of healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant but some had pseudoresistance reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption
meta analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases
although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis the sequalae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty
some of these risk factors include obesity advancing age diabetes mellitus dyslipidaemia and inflammatory diseases
adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes which vary slightly from country to country for example mg in britain and mg in the united states
smaller doses are based on these standards eg mg and mg tablets
the tablets are commonly called baby aspirin or baby strength because they were originallybut no longerintended to be administered to infants and children
no medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the mg and the mg tablets
the dose required for benefit appears to depend on a persons weight
for those weighing less than low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease for patients above this weight higher doses are required
in general for adults doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever
for the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease much lower doses are taken once daily
march recommendations from the uspstf on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged and women aged to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in mi for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage
the whi study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a lower risk of death from any cause though there was no significant difference between mg and mg aspirin doses
the adaptable study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between mg and mg doses of aspirin in patients with established cardiovascular disease
low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events and lower aspirin doses may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long term prevention
in children with kawasaki disease aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks
in october the us food and drug administration required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid
they recommend avoiding nsaids in pregnant women at weeks or later in pregnancy
one exception to the recommendation is the use of low dose mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional
aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to nsaids and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or nsaid precipitated bronchospasm
owing to its effect on the stomach lining manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers mild diabetes or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin
even if none of these conditions is present the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin
people with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates
